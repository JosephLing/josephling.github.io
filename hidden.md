                <p>A new best-selling book is The Fourth Turning by the American writers William Strauss and Neil Howe. It is a sad book in many ways. In that respect it is a symptom of the modern Western world it is trying to analyse. Referring to the United States, it says that the country "feels like it's unravelling." It goes on:</p>

<blockquote><div>Though we live in an era of relative peace and comfort, we have settled into a mood of pessimism about the long-term future, fearful that our superpower nation is somehow rotting from within. </div></blockquote>

<p>Neither an epic victory over Communism nor an extended upswing of the business cycle can buoy our public spirit. The Cold War and New Deal struggles are plainly over, but we are of no mind to bask in their successes. The America of today feels worse, in its fundamentals, than the one many of us remember from youth, a society presided over by those of supposedly lesser consciousness. Wherever we look ... we see paths to a foreboding future. We yearn for civic character but satisfy ourselves with symbolic gestures and celebrity circuses. We perceive no greatness in our leaders, a new meanness in ourselves. Small wonder that each new election brings a new jolt, its aftermath a new disappointment.<br><br>The authors' solution seems little more than a fatalistic hope for the wheels of history to bring in a new cycle that will produce new leadership after a major catastrophe. What is significant for us is the fact that the book was published after the re-election of President Clinton and a Presidential election that was, to many Americans, very depressing. The book and, therefore, the above extract are relevant to us as we face our General Election. <br><br>At a fundamental level Britain is almost a mirror image of the United States in spite of our many different traditions. America, as Talcot Parsons described it, is simply the "lead society" - in a number of things it just gets there first. <br><br>We, too, in Britain "have settled into a mood of pessimism about the long-term future." We have peace and national security. And contrary to what the media and the opposition seem to suggest, our economy is now healthy. But Britain "of today feels worse, in its fundamentals, than the one many of us remember from youth ... We perceive no greatness in our leaders [in church or state], a new meanness in ourselves."<br><br>That is why as we face a General Election we must have few expectations that the problems that need to be solved will be solved by the next government, of whichever colour that is. If we do, "its aftermath" will be "a new disappointment." <br><br>What is the problem?<br><br><br><b>The importance of "culture"</b><br><br>First, there is too great an expectation from the political process. The power and influence of Marx in terms of "structures" has been enormous - even on people who claim to oppose most of his teaching.<br><br>In our own country, since the last century and the debates over suffrage, there has been an inflated view of the importance of politics. And since the 1970's the church and some of its leaders have been particularly seduced by that inflated view.<br><br>At root, apart from the simple temptation to power that Jesus himself faced when the devil offered him "all the kingdoms of the world" (Matt 4.8), the problem is this: the equation of "the state" with "society". It is the equation of Parliament Square with the Public Square. In its extreme form it is the totalitarian impulse. The defeat of Hitler in 1945 and Communism in 1989 should have been enough to explode the myth. But there will always be those who think that political institutions can give a quick fix to society's problems, as well as individuals who see political institutions as a source of personal prestige.<br><br>Society, of course, is much bigger than the state. There are families, churches, schools, universities, various voluntary associations and a host of other groups, organizations and institutions - what Burke called the "little platoons" and Peter Berger and Richard Neuhaus "mediating structures". These stand between the state and the individual. The state relates to these but their identity is not derived from the state.<br><br>And these "mediating structures" are hugely significant in terms of societal well being and growth. They relate to "the culture" of a society and are the vital carries of its beliefs, values and morals. But we have been conditioned into thinking that in relative terms these are unimportant, whereas what goes on in Parliament is where the real issues are discussed and settled. Professor David Martin, the sociologist talks of a "a misleading polarity" between a culture and its political structures, "where the former is seen as derivative and passive and the latter as the arena of effective power and political action."<br><br>But Evangelical and Pentecostal movements in Latin America, on the one hand, and Evangelical, Catholic, and Orthodox movements in Eastern Europe, on the other hand, have shown the power of such Christian forces in social change. It is not that they are "derivative and passive" but, in a real sense, it is the political processes that are "derivative and passive" - witness what happened in Rumania and the collapse of the Berlin Wall.<br><br>The "cultural margins" simply do affect the so-called "political centres". David Martin now argues that what happens is that</p>

<blockquote><div>the potentials built up and stored in culture [and the religious community] and the slow uneventful changes that occur there are, in the long run, rich in consequence. They really make a difference in respect of things that really matter.</div></blockquote>

<p>But because we don't see that, we fail to realise the significance of the Christian gospel to social change. That is why we must not be falsely modest as Christians. And that is why Archbishop William Temple said: "if we have to choose between making men Christian and making the social order more Christian, we must choose the former." That is why the priority has to be evangelism.<br><br>It is in this context that we must now understand the social depression that is present both sides of the Atlantic. It is quite simply because there is a moral and spiritual vacuum. <br><br>For a society to cohere and function healthily you need not only a good political order and a good economic order, but also a good moral and spiritual order. In that respect a society or a nation is like a three-legged stool. If one leg is missing it cannot stand up. At present in the West the Christian leg is missing. Any fears of social collapse have to be seen in this light. As Jesus said - quoting the Old Testament: "Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God."<br><br><br><b>The public debate</b><br><br>The public debate therefore needs to be about moral and spiritual issues as we face the General Election. That is where there is disagreement and where, for social health, we need agreement. Too often the moral and spiritual agenda is set and controlled by unrepresentative groups of libertarian professionals who are hi-jacking our civil order.<br><br>Today there is a general agreement about certain ends - that is why Politics seems so tedious. Most people of good-will believe, for example, that one, there should be basic welfare and health care for all; two, reasonable freedom for economic initiative and economic development; and, three, good relationships with Europe but not a single state.<br><br>The political arguments are then about means. And at this point it is very difficult to claim that there is a Christian answer. That is why the role of the church and Christians as Christians in politics is limited. It is limited to discussing ends and to criticising existing means that self-evidently do not achieve those ends. Again let me quote William Temple. He gave this analogy to illustrate the point:</p>

<blockquote><div>If a bridge is to be built, the Church may remind the engineer that it is his obligation to provide a really save bridge; but it is not entitled to tell him whether, in fact, his design meets this requirement ... in just the same way the Church may tell the politician what ends the social order should promote; but it must leave to the politician the devising of the precise means to those ends.</div></blockquote>

<p>Temple, actually, advocated the three ends of "freedom, fellowship and service". And it was in that context that the Archbishop argued that "the Church and the official representatives of the Church must keep themselves free from the entanglements of party politics."<br><br>What has happened, sadly, over the last two decades is for Christians - and not least Evangelical Christians - to become very politicised. In the United States they have aligned with the Right; in this country with the Left. Both strategies have been unhelpful.<br><br>In the United States some Christians have thought that their moral causes would be promoted by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. They have been sadly disillusioned. Under the Republicans abortion increased; gay rights became rampant; and the family disintegrated and is still disintegrating. In the words of the title of a recent book, America is "Slouching Towards Gomorrah". The Republican Right paid "lip service" to "morality", but it did not and has not delivered. It is, of course, the same in this country. The Tory Right has also paid lip service to morality and not delivered.<br><br>Nor are things better now under the Democratic Left in America. Nor can we expect them to be better under a New Labour Left in this country. In the United States the Democrats have focused their lip service not on "morality" but on "the poor". However, it is argued that under President Clinton the poverty problem of the underclass seems to increase in proportion as the President liberalises moral restraints and further erodes the sexual ethic thus further eroding the stability of the traditional family.<br><br><br><b>Dysfunctioning</b><br><br>Current politics is dysfunctional and it will be so, whoever gets into power. It is hard to see how there can be satisfactory government when opinions are so divided. The problem is a major division of opinions within the parties over moral and spiritual, or "cultural" issues.<br><br>Of course, on a range of legislative proposals and budgetary decisions where there are no such issues at stake, Government will function perfectly well. But the key issues in society as we approach the end of the century and the 21st century are moral and spiritual. Some have claimed that there is in Western society a "Culture War" - a Kultur Kampf - going on. It has to do with the nature of society and what sort of world do we want our children and grand-children to be growing up in. That is why education is top of the agenda in so many people's minds and moral issues are concerning so many right-minded people. <br><br>Put simply, do you want your child (or grand-child) to grow up being taught - with all the pressure and power of peers and persuasive school teachers - that all religions are as good as each other; that Jesus is not the only way; that the individual has to make up moral rules (on sex and everything else) because there are no absolute standards; that abortion is OK; that homosexual sex is OK; that while some drugs are harmful, marijuana is OK; that all is relative; that nothing of itself is right and nothing of itself is wrong - apart from a few politically correct shibboleths? Do you want all that? Do you still want to see one in three babies being born outside marriage? Do you want the inanities and the drip-feed of the secular hedonism of the electronic media shaping the public life that you and your children have to be a part of? As E.J.Mishan once wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>Can anyone care very much what happens to a society whose members are continually and visible obsessed with sexual carousal - to a society where, in effect, the human animal has been reduced to a life-style that consists in the main activity of alternatively inflaming itself and relieving itself?</div></blockquote>

<p>All those issues are what the "Culture Wars" are about. And the majority have a clear preference. There is a moral majority. Polls tells us that the majority do think adultery, homosexual sex and other sexual sins are always wrong. But there is a paralysis of action. This is due, in part, to the growing irrelevance of the old political categories and the political leaderships being committed to "lowest common denominator" policies. Let me explain.<br><br>In the Tory Party, for example, there are what can be called Libertarian Conservatives at the same time as there are Civic Capitalists. But on these fundamental moral issues they are in totally opposite camps. Thus you have Libertarian Conservatives now making the running in the homosexualization campaign with other Conservatives quite appalled. In the last week of February John Bowis the Tory minister of transport was advocating virtual gay marriage. But the majority of MEP Tories voted against gay marriage in Europe (with the majority of Labour MEPs for it). Similarly in the Labour Party you have ethical socialists and egoistical socialists who similarly are divided. Ethical socialists are among those giving the greatest support for the traditional family and traditional morality - such as Norman Dennis and A.H.Halsey. But they are opposed vigorously by other socialists who on these moral issues are nearer to Libertarian Tories. Already we know, for example, that Chris Smith the Labour Shadow Health minister (an open homosexual) will try to repeal Clause 28 so that homosexuality can, unashamedly, be promoted in schools. Jack Straw and Tony Blair are both committed to reducing further the age of consent of homosexual sex down to 16. It is now a farcical state of affairs. You have elements within the two main parties that are nearer to elements within their respective oppositions than they are to others within their own parties. But because the parties are split on these vital ethical issues, neither leader can give a sure lead. Inevitably there is a "lowest common denominator policy". Inevitably that means that the most libertarian position is validated as legitimate and society is further demoralized. <br><br><br><b>New alignments</b><br><br>It is a fact that the old categories are less and less helpful nationally and internationally. Take "left" and "right". The communists used to be located on the left, but now in the former Soviet Union they are located on the right! Take another pair, "fundamentalist" and "radical". "Fundamentalist" is now an "all purpose pejorative in the vocabulary of liberal moral panic" (David Martin). But why don't we class the IRA as "fundamentalist"? After all they want to force on Protestant Northern Ireland a Catholic nationalist package and they are fanatically violent. If they were Muslims we would call them "fundamentalist" and place them on the extreme right. Not being called "fundamentalist" makes the IRA quasi-respectable and puts the IRA somewhere on the Left.<br><br>Labels are becoming meaningless. The old categories and the old parties are losing their significance. Of course there are "traditions" that are still effective. But it is questionable how long they will remain. So what do Christians do in the meantime, while more and more seems to be influx?<br><br>They need to remember that the kingdom of God cannot be made coterminous with any one political party. They need to realise that politics has a limited use - the realm of Caesar is God's fundamental provision for fallen men and women, not so much to secure love or justice as </p>

<blockquote><div>some reasonable measure of security against murder, robbery and starvation (William Temple).</div></blockquote>

<p>As and when Christians can, they need to be involved in the political process at least by participating in elections. It is their duty in a democratic order. After all they, the electorate, are part of "the governing authorities" that "have been established by God" (Rom 13.1).<br><br>But they never must idolize any of the political parties, nor, at the moment in our own country, demonize any of the respective parties. It seems that within all three parties there are committed Christians with good consciences. Nevertheless Christians must be clear that the problems of public life at present are fundamentally not economic or governmental but moral and spiritual. As Jesus said: "from within, out of men's hearts" comes what is evil (Mark 7.20). So you work and vote, for example, for the Christian faith to be taught clearly in our schools and freedom for Christian schools. You support Cardinal Winning when he challenges Tony Blair over abortion when 97 percent of abortions are currently for social reasons. You support ethical socialists like Norman Dennis who prove that so many social problems are due to the breakdown of the traditional family. You oppose Tories and Socialists who support no fault divorce and tax policies that de-privilege marriage. You oppose Chris Smith and any Labour homosexualization campaign. But you support Labour in its opposition to Sunday Trading. At that point you oppose the Tories. You opposes everyone over the National Lottery.<br><br>We surely ought to try to turn this election into an issues election and focus on the restoration of those issues that will help "remoralize" our society and help rebuild the traditional family. Equally we must keep an eye open to ensure the rights of Christian worship and witness. After all Paul suggested that the main purpose of Government was the provision of a state where "we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness" (1 Tim 2.2).<br><br><br><b>The future</b><br><br>The future is bleak. Until there is a Christian revival we can hope for little at the level of the state. Only then will there be what William Temple called "the formation of that mind and temper in the whole community which will lead to wholesome legislation by any party and all parties."<br><br>In the mean time two things need to happen. First, we need to realize what is going on. Then, secondly, like-minded people have to take action in many small and little ways. That is how cultures are affected. Revival starts and works church by church, Christian by Christian. Schools change, school by school. Every opportunity must be taken at work and at leisure for standing up for Christ, his gospel and his standards. Never forget the importance of the "margins". Above all pray that God's will is done in the General Election.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Abortion - Changing Opinions">(April 1997) Abortion - Changing Opinions</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 1997</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>A Case for Life</b><br><br>A recent film was entitled A Case for Life.<br><br>The film began with a scene of "pro-life" demonstrators outside an abortion clinic in America. Then Kelly, one of the film's major characters, is introduced. She arrives to join the protest accompanied by two young children. Kelly is portrayed as a sensitive human being - not an "odd ball". She is a mother with a sense of humour, but with a passionate commitment to the anti-abortion cause.<br><br>Her sister, Liz, is a "pro-choice" lawyer. She is seen arriving at the clinic with a client who has come for an abortion. There is then a confrontation at the door and Kelly faints. Her sister Liz rushes to help. But Kelly is in serious trouble because she is pregnant with her fifth child and has heart disease.<br><br>She will be all right, it seems, with open-heart surgery. However, her 7-week-old foetus would come through the operation, if at all, having severe brain damage, or so she and her husband are told. The doctor, therefore, recommends a therapeutic abortion.<br><br>"What happens if we wait?" is the question the couple ask. The reply is that the growing baby will put more strain on Kelly's heart. She could have an enforced rest regime, but even then the chances that the baby would survive are slim. And the chances that Kelly would survive are put at no more than 15 percent.<br><br>Kelly decides against an abortion. Liz strongly opposes. She feels that Kelly should have the abortion for the sake of the other children as well as herself. She, therefore, seeks support in the family. Kelly's father and mother are both "pro-life". With great difficulty they eventually support Kelly's decision. The mother says: "We take life as it comes, try to do the right thing and trust that God in his infinite wisdom knows better than we do."<br><br>But when Liz is able to persuade Kelly's husband, Bob, to take legal action to force his wife to have the abortion, the court hearing that follows generates huge hostility between the sisters. The judge, however, rules in favour of Kelly and the pregnancy continues. Then comes the climax. Kelly is 27 weeks pregnant. Her heart gives out. The baby dies. But she lives. Finally, after an interval of time the sisters are reconciled, agreeing to disagree over abortion.<br><br><br><b>A shift of public opinion</b><br><br>What is significant about this film? The journalist Mona Charen, who has publicized and written about this film, reckoned the significance was that it was shown on an large, otherwise "liberal", US TV network as the Sunday Night Movie. For such a network to schedule such a sympathetic "pro-life" film was in itself evidence of a shift of public opinion. Mona Charen wrote:<br><br>What surprised me about the film is that it conveyed more than the humanity of pro-lifers. It offered a glimpse of their nobility. Kelly's willingness to risk her life for her child is presented not as the inexplicable stance of a fanatic but as the selfless act of a believer. Not every pro-lifer would agree that hers was the only possible course. But even her sister, who is equally committed to the pro-choice cause, says, "I admire her so much." It may not be a breakthrough - but when a major network presents the pro-life cause with sympathy and even grudging admiration, the ground of the debate is starting to shift.<br><br>There is a shift in this country, too. I discovered that when being interviewed for a TV programme last summer. This was at the time of the outrage at the abortion of a healthy twin of a middle-class mother on "social" grounds. <br><br>The producer, in conversation, said that while he would consider himself liberal in theological and ethical matters, that abortion of a healthy twin had made him think. Also the response to Cardinal Winning and his challenge to Tony Blair over abortion has been interesting. Many have argued (rightly, I would suggest) that the Conservative Government has been hypocritical in claiming to be pro-family while liberalising the divorce laws. But the Labour Party, according to the Cardinal's implication, is similarly hypocritical over abortion. It was pointed out that Tony Blair claims to be against abortion but votes for it, while pro-lifers in the Labour Party are marginalised. The local Labour MP for Blyth, Ronnie Campbell, is therefore to be commended. He publicly reported how activists tried to deselect him and fellow MPs said his career was at risk because he supported Liberal Democrat MP David Alton's proposals to lower the legal time-limit on abortions. (If you want to see how all the MPs have voted on this and other moral issues, you can now see that on the Christian Institute's Web Site.<br><br><br><b>Facts and figures</b><br><br>In the light of all this the presence of "pro-life" candidates in the coming General Election is interesting and also indicative of a certain shift in public opinion. What especially concerns the public, in no small measure, is the Christian Institute's recent high-lighting of official Government figures. The latest figures available show that for married couples only 8 percent of pregnancies are aborted, while for unmarried couples the figure is 33 percent. Nor is abortion a matter of poverty.<br><br>The fact is that the most prosperous areas have among the highest abortion rates, while areas of high unemployment have lower abortion rates. Most serious of all, out of 156,539 abortions in 1994 only 147 were because the mother's life was in danger; in only 1,796 cases was there a risk that the child would be born handicapped; and in only 2 percent of cases was there a grave risk of permanent injury to the mental or physical health of the mother. That means that 97 percent of all abortions are performed for social reasons. That surely is quite wicked. But why? Let me repeat some arguments from a Coloured Supplement I wrote seven years ago.<br><br>The 1967 Abortion Act never said that abortion was moral. It simply said that certain abortions would not be the concern of the criminal law. But practically that legitimised abortion for millions. So, how, do you decide the morality of abortion? Many people play a game of "ethical snap". Someone cites a case of a woman or girl in desperate poverty who wants an abortion; someone then "snaps" that with horrific photos of dead foetuses and dismembered foetal limbs.<br><br>The pro-choice people accuse the anti-abortionists of being sentimental in the operating theatre. The pro-life people accuse the abortionists of being sentimental in the counselling room. Others say it is all a matter of motives. If people have good motives that is enough. If they decide with reasonably unselfish motives, that justifies an abortion. But the Bible suggests that while bad motives make good actions morally hypocritical and wrong, good motives do not make wrong actions good. Peter, no doubt, had some good motives in opposing the way of the Cross for Jesus; but Jesus saw that activity as Satanic.<br><br><br><b>The Christian tradition</b><br><br>First, we need to note some history. Abortion was common in ancient Greece - hence the Hippocratic Oath for doctors: "Thou shalt not give a woman a pessary to produce an abortion." It was also common in the Roman Empire. By the time of Christ abortion was well-known and common in the ancient world.<br><br>But the coming of Christ and the spread of the Christian faith brought a challenge to the practice of abortion. In the period immediately following that of the Apostles - the period of the Fathers - one of the distinctives that marked off the Church from its pagan environment was its opposition to abortion. This was a fruit of the Gospel - the extension of care to the humblest of human "beings", including human foetal life. So early canon law, and then subsequent pronouncements, in general have defended the foetus as "human" or "human on the way" and so worthy of Christian love and protection.<br><br>More recently an ethics of "justifiable foeticide" has evolved. This, too, claims a Christian basis, namely that human life itself does not have an absolute, but only a very high value. There may, therefore, be occasions when life can be taken or protection withdrawn. But such a very serious action has to be justified. As with "the just war", the right to do this cannot be presumed. It has to be argued for.<br><br>Most would agree that a serious threat to the actual life of the mother is a justifying reason. Some argue that some congenital deformity is a justifying reason (although they would argue that this has to be such that no life outside the womb can be maintained).<br><br>But these and other difficult cases are very rare. As we have seen, most abortions are for "social" reasons. That is why the issue is a serious moral issue that Christians cannot ignore. It is the taking of innocent life.<br><br><br><b>The Bible</b><br><br>But is it innocent life? Is "human life" being destroyed in abortion or in embryo research? And why should conception be so important? What does the Bible say?<br><br>Exodus 21.22 refers to an injury to a pregnant woman. If she miscarries, the claims of the foetus are assessed as less than her own. But violence to the foetus is an offence. Mostly, however, the Bible speaks at a more general level. Ecclesiastes 11.5 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>As you do not know ... how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.</div></blockquote>

<p>Probably the RSV translation is better - "you do not know how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child". This suggests that there should be a certain agnosticism or humility in our thinking about ante-natal life. We, indeed, are not facing a blob of tissue, but a divine mystery; the womb contains not only a body but a "spirit".<br><br>The philosophical and basic question is this: whose is the history of that which is in the womb - the mother's or someone else's? The Psalmist had no doubt. It was his history. He was in the womb:</p>

<blockquote><div>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb (Ps 139.13).</div></blockquote>

<p>Isaiah said much the same thing:</p>

<blockquote><div>Before I was born the LORD called me; from my birth he has made mention of my name (Is 49.1).</div></blockquote>

<p>Most importantly this is the understanding of the New Testament in the birth stories of Jesus. The incarnation of the Son of God began not with his birth but with his conception. So we say in the Creed:</p>

<blockquote><div>He was conceived ...</div></blockquote>

<p>In so far as Jesus Christ reveals true man (as well as true God), the inescapable conclusion is that life in the womb is human from conception.<br><br>Human in what way?<br><br>The fundamental Christian belief is in a God who gives, a God of "grace". He gave his only Son for our sins. And human life is a "gift". When Job was bereaved he said:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away (Job 1.21).</div></blockquote>

<p>Human life is "given"; it is not "achieved". This is so important; and that is because we do not "achieve" our humanity by reaching certain standards of performance or development.<br><br>But today in the debate on abortion (and foetal experimentation) many argue, or at least imply, that the word "human" (and so the offer of protection) is to be applied only where there are certain "achievements" in terms of physical performance or psychological or mental development. But his is a totalitarian road that goes on to exclude from the category of the "human" certain social, racial or credal "achievements". So the mentally retarded, coloured people, Jews and others can be dispensed with. We have seen all that this century.<br><br>But if humanity is a "gift", the first "fourteen" days surely are irrelevant. These cannot be seen as "non-being". What matters is that behind human "pro-creation" is the "divine creation". Protection is to be offered to human beings not because they "reach a certain stage of development" but because of the given fact of being created by God in his image:</p>

<blockquote><div>Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.</div></blockquote>

<p>But we must not blur distinctions if we say the foetus is "human". We are saying that in virtue of its genotype or genetic code it is a distinct being that has been pro-created. It may be that God's creative powers, entrusted to men and women, have been misused. But that is not a ground for destroying what has been created. And what is created is a human foetus. It is not a human infant, nor a human adolescent, nor a human adult, nor a senile human being. If a senile person is a degenerating member of humanity, the foetus is a developing member. The boundaries are death and conception.<br><br>Nor is the foetus only "potentially human". Yes, the foetus only "potentially" has the characteristics it will develop; but the new born baby only potentially has the characteristics it will develop (as a toddler or teenager). An ovum or sperm is "potentially human". A foetus is a "human with potential". Nor must we moralize, like bomber pilots over Viet Nam, according to size. An embryo may look, and be, tiny. A Viet Nam village looks microscopic from 30,000 feet. So it doesn't feel so bad dropping bombs from that distance. But often innocent people were being killed.<br><br>There are many other problems.<br><br>The good news is about forgiveness at the Cross of Calvary, where Christ bore the sins of the world, including sins associated with abortion, and including the sins of others that lead to abortion. Some reading this may be scarred by having had, or being involved in, an abortion. The Gospel is that Christ loves the sinner and forgives, but he hates the sin and says: "Go and sin no more."<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Trinity and the Athanasian Creed (again)">(May 1997) The Trinity and the Athanasian Creed (again)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>25 May is Trinity Sunday. The Trinity is a doctrine beyond the grasp of our finite minds - it is a great mystery. It is the affirmation of a "tri" "unity" in God. It is an affirmation of the fact that God is both three and one.<br><br><br><b>The Catechism</b><br><br>For many Christians the doctrine of the Trinity is something they readily affirm and say they believe. But they prefer not to think about it too much. That is dangerous. It is a way of letting in heresies that can eventually destroy their faith in Christ as Saviour and Lord.<br><br>The old formularies of the Church of England are quite clear about the Trinity. Article I of the Thirty-nine Articles says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>in unity of [the] Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost [Spirit].</div></blockquote>

<p>In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer the doctrine of the Trinity is clearly taught in the Catechism (the Catechism used to be learned by heart by those being confirmed, and it also used to be taught in Church Schools to the children who attended.) The doctrine is summed up there in these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who hath made me, and all the world.Secondly, in God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all mankind.Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost [Spirit], who sanctifieth me, and all the elect people of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is to be the response of the candidate to the question put immediately after they have recited the Apostles' Creed. The question is:<br><br>What doest thou chiefly learn in these Articles of thy Belief?<br><br>The creed is, therefore, taught as "Articles of Belief".<br><br><br><b>The Creeds</b><br><br>The word "creed" comes from the Latin word credo. The creeds are in fact summaries of Christian belief. They started life as tools in the early church for the "follow up" of new converts and probably were used at baptisms. The creeds are thoroughly "trinitarian" in content and shape.<br><br>There are hints of credal formulas in the New Testament itself. 1 Timothy 3.16 is an example:</p>

<blockquote><div>Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.</div></blockquote>

<p>It was not unnatural, therefore, that Christians continued to draft short summaries for new converts. Because of specific controversies and certain specific denials of biblical and apostolic teaching these early creeds focused on the Trinity. And there are three basic creeds, the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian creeds.<br><br>At Jesmond we say The Apostles' Creed at normal morning and evening services. This was not composed by the twelve apostles. It was probably written in the generation after the apostles in the second century. But it is called the "Apostles" creed as it teaches concisely the apostolic teaching about God that you get in the New Testament.<br><br>The creed we recite at Jesmond at Holy Communion is The Nicene Creed. It is a little longer than The Apostles' Creed, and it gets its name from the Council of Nicea in AD 325. At that Council the doctrine of the deity of Jesus Christ was reaffirmed in the wake of the Arian controversy. Arius was a presbyter of Alexandria who denied Christ's deity; and his teaching was ruled heretical at Nicea. So in The Nicene Creed we say that Jesus is "the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father".<br><br>The third creed, The Athanasian Creed, we never recite together in our services. But it is important we do not neglect it. Unfortunately it is often forgotten, yet it is included in the Book of Common Prayer and so should be part of Anglican consciousness.<br><br>Who was Athanasius? He was the Bishop of Alexandria that almost single handed at one point was responsible for the defence of biblical faith against Arianism. But he did not write the "Athanasian" creed. The situation is similar to the case of the "Apostles" creed. This creed echoes the biblical orthodoxy Athanasius stood for just as the Apostles' Creed echoes the orthodoxy the Apostles stood for.<br><br>And why should we and other churches recite these creeds? The answer is that they rule out all sorts of errors that contradict the plain teaching and implication of the bible. And these errors, sadly, so easily and regularly surface. They have done so throughout church history. We can assume they will do so in the future. They are doing so today!<br><br><br><b>The Bible and the Trinity</b><br><br>The official teaching of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England regarding the creeds is definite - Article VIII:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of holy Scripture.</div></blockquote>

<p>That last phrase of Article VIII is what is important. The creeds are to be believed because "they may be proved ... by ... holy Scripture."<br><br>What then does the Bible teach?<br><br>It certainly teaches "trinitarian" doctrine. Jesus taught that his disciples were to baptise "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." And notice, he said "name" not "names".<br><br>But the bible is clear that God is a transcendent God, the almighty God, who passes our finite understanding. Isaiah 55.9:</p>

<blockquote><div>As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.</div></blockquote>

<p>So at the same time as we affirm the "trinity", that must always be kept in mind. There is so much we do not understand about the nature of God - his eternity, the fact that he is all-knowing, and his providence and sovereign ordering of history and individual life. J.I.Packer puts it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>how the one eternal God is eternally both singular and plural, how Father, Son and Spirit are personally distinct yet essentially one (so that tritheism, belief in three gods who are not one, and Unitarianism, belief in one God who is not three, are both wrong), is more than we can know, and any attempt to "explain" it - to dispel the mystery by reasoning, as distinct from confessing it from Scripture - is bound to falsify it. Here, as elsewhere, our God is too big for his creatures' little minds.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The truth of the Trinity</b><br><br>The truth of the Trinity is confirmed in three ways. First there are the facts of history as we can see them in the bible. These force us to make a Trinitarian confession. In the bible you see a man who was God praying to his Father. And then he promised that he and his Father would send "the Counsellor" - the Holy Spirit to continue the divine ministry.<br><br>Secondly there is the experience of Christians. This also confirms that confession - Christians "worshipping God the Father above you and knowing the fellowship of God the Son beside you, both through the prompting of God the Holy Spirit within you."<br><br>Thirdly, there is, as we have said, the bible itself. The bible teaches that there is a co-operative activity of the Three in our salvation. See Romans 8.1-17; Ephesians 1.3-14; and many other passages including 2 Corinthians 13.14:</p>

<blockquote><div>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</div></blockquote>

<p>It is, therefore, sad that the "Confession of our Christian Faith, commonly called the Creed of Saint Athanasius" is neglected. It is the affirmation of Trinitarian orthodoxy; and it should be said, according the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, on Christmas Day, Easter Day, Ascension Day, Whitsunday, Trinity Sunday and some other occasions as well.<br><br>But some modern Christians are embarrassed by this creed because they do not like the doctrine about the Godhead and the person of Jesus Christ that it teaches. It has now been completely omitted from the modern Alternative Service Book.<br><br><br><b>The Athanasian Creed</b><br><br>What then does the creed say? Three years ago I wrote on this creed in a Coloured Supplement and gave you, more or less, the traditional translation from the Latin. Here, however, is a more recent translation by C.H. Turner and it is based on the revised Latin text:</p>

<blockquote><div>Who ever desires to be saved must above all things hold the Catholic faith. Unless a man keeps it in its entirety inviolate, he will assuredly perish eternally.</div></blockquote>

<p>Now this is the Catholic faith, that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in unity, without confusing the persons or dividing the substance. For the Father's person is one, the Son's another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is one, their glory is equal, their majesty coeternal.<br><br>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, such also the Holy Spirit. The Father is increate, the Son increate, the Holy Spirit increate. The Father is infinite, the Son infinite, the Holy Spirit infinite. The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal. Yet there are not there eternals, but one eternal; just as there are not three increates or three infinites, but one increate and one infinite. In the same way the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, the Holy Spirit almighty; yet there are not three almighties, but one almighty.<br><br>Thus the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit God; and yet there are not three Gods, but there is one God. Thus the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet there are not three Lords, but there is one Lord. Because just as we are obliged by Christian truth to acknowledge each person separately both God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the Catholic religion to speak of three Gods or Lords.<br><br>The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created but begotten. The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this trinity there is nothing before or after, nothing greater or less, but all three persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. Thus in all things, as has been stated above both Trinity in unity and unity in Trinity must be worshipped. So he who desires to be saved should think thus of the Trinity.<br><br>It is necessary, however, to eternal salvation that he should also faithfully believe in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is equally both God and man.<br><br>He is God from the Father's substance, begotten before time; and he is man from his mother's substance, born in time. Perfect God, perfect man composed of a rational soul and human flesh, equal to the Father in respect of his divinity, less than the Father in respect of his humanity.<br><br>Who although he is God and man, is nevertheless not two but one Christ. He is one, however, not by the transformation of his divinity into flesh, but by the taking up of his humanity into God; one certainly not by confusion of substance, but by oneness of person. For just as rational soul and flesh are a single man, so God and man are a single Christ.<br><br>Who suffered for our salvation, descended to hell, rose from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the Father's right hand, whence he will come to judge living and dead: at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies, and will render an account of their deeds; and those who have behaved well will go to eternal life, those who have behaved badly to eternal fire.<br><br>This is the Catholic faith. Unless a man believes it faithfully and steadfastly, he will not be able to be saved.<br><br><br><b>Others</b><br><br>The opposition to this creed not only comes from its content but also from its second sentence. In its defence I like to quote C.S.Lewis:</p>

<blockquote><div>I will not labour the point that [this] work is not exactly a creed and was not by St Athanasius, for I think it is a very fine piece of writing. The words "which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly" [BCP] are the offence. They are commonly misunderstood. The operative word is keep; not acquire, or even believe but keep. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters, not about those who have never heard of Christ, nor even those who have misunderstood and refused to accept Him, but of those who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion or any other invited confusion to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought. They are a warning against the curious modern assumption that all changes of belief, however brought about, are necessarily exempt from blame.</div></blockquote>

<p>But C.S.Lewis is not the only champion of The Athanasian Creed. The great Duke of Wellington remarked that he had come to the conclusion that "every word of it was borne out by Holy Scripture". Another supporter was Bishop Seabury. Writing to his friend Dr Parker on 29 December 1790 he said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>With regard to the propriety of reading the Athanasian Creed in Church, I was never fully convinced. With regard to the impropriety of banishing it out of the Prayer-book I am clear.</div></blockquote>

<p>Surely once a year we ought consciously to think about these things. That is because we cannot honestly escape what this creed summarizes and teaches. Its doctrines are statements that follow the facts and the mystery of God rather than explain them. They are like fences that surround the truth. They rule out wrong beliefs (such as there being three gods) that would deny biblical revelation and destroy a living faith in Jesus Christ. Some argue that these concepts in the Athanasian Creed are 5th century Greek philosophical concepts; and modern people don't need them. This is quite untrue. There are no particular philosophical doctrines in the Athanasian Creed. They are all theological. Yes, certain words are used like "person" and "substance". But these were words in common speech. The technical uses of these and similar terms came from Christian use in theological debate.<br><br>Yes, there is a problem for human language - it is the amazing fact that God himself was born at Bethlehem and walked and taught in Galilee and died on the cross and rose on Easter Day. It was not somebody else, a different person named Jesus. Yes, it was God the Son who was born of Mary, not God the Father. But when we face this fact - so clear from the pages of the Bible and proved in experience - this ceases to be a problem. Rather it is the presupposition behind everything else. This is the ultimate reality. And the reality is this: the Old Testament makes it quite clear that there is only one God. The New Testament makes it clear that Jesus who prayed to his Father is himself prayed to by his disciples. Without any feeling of inconsistency these monotheistic Jews believed Jesus to be divine.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Let me close with another quote from J.I.Packer. He makes the following observation:</p>

<blockquote><div>the basic assertion of this doctrine is that the unity of the one God is complex ... [There] are not three roles played by one person (that is modalism), nor are there three gods in a person (that is tritheism); the one God ("he") is also, and equally, "they" and "they" are always together and always cooperating, with the Father initiating, the Son complying, and the Spirit executing the will of both, which is his will also ... The practical importance of the doctrine of the Trinity is that it requires us to pay equal attention and give equal honour, to all three persons in the unity of their gracious ministry to us. That ministry is the subject matter of the gospel, which, as Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus shows, cannot be stated without bringing in their distinct roles in God's plan of grace (John 3.1-21).</div></blockquote>

                <p><b>Edmund Burke</b><br><br>The eighteenth century Irish statesman, philosopher and political theorist, Edmund Burke, is credited with the remark that "evil prevails when good men do nothing". What he actually said on one occasion was:</p>

<blockquote><div>When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.</div></blockquote>

<p>The late 20th century has seen an assault on Christian moral standards by minorities in the media, the educational empire and the therapeutic services. Perhaps, therefore, we should take Burke's advice to heart.<br><br>But Burke said a lot of other wise things. A number of them are now rooted in the English language as proverbial sayings such as "the age of chivalry is gone" and "man is by his constitution a religious animal."<br><br>Burke had the virtue of seeing life whole and seeing connections. He saw the importance of the Christian faith for social cohesion. He was committed to a sane rationality. But he also saw the importance of "wise prejudice"<br><br><br><b>"Wise prejudice"</b><br><br>Prejudice, Burke argued, was an ally of reason and part of it. It complemented and gave effect to reason's judgments. This is what he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason; because we suspect that this stock of reason in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages. Many of our men of speculation [thinkers], instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and to leave nothing but the naked reason; because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection which will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previously [earlier] engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, sceptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit; and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes part of his nature.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The need for prejudice</b><br><br>The point being made is that we cannot judge every case on its merits the moment it presents itself to us. This is the fallacy of situational ethics, an ethics without absolutes. It atomizes every event as a unique item and requires you to re-invent the moral wheel each time. You simply cannot do that. So many problems present themselves to us "in the emergency" - to use Burke's phrase. Particularly these "emergencies" occur with regard to honesty - either truth telling or sexual honesty.<br><br>If you have no "prejudice" in favour of truth telling, the consequences are inevitable. When, for example, you think you will cause yourself great trouble or short term harm by telling the truth, the chances are you will lie. If you have no "prejudice" in favour of reserving sex for heterosexual monogamous marriage, the consequences are also inevitable. It will be more than likely that you will give in to your emotions and unrestrained sexual drives when by your "own evil desire" (James 1.14) you are "dragged away and enticed".<br><br>The bible is a book that gives you "wise prejudices". It makes pre-judgments about a whole host of possible situations and gives you guidance as to what to do or what not do.<br><br><br><b>Prejudice and medicine</b><br><br>There must be "prejudices" in life. If you are a doctor and involved in community or preventative medicine, your stock in trade is "wise prejudice". Your business is to assess the likelihood of something happening - of increased risks - before they do happen; and then taking appropriate action.<br><br>For example, epidemiology starts by assessing the increased likelihood of certain categories of people getting certain diseases - eg smokers getting lung cancer. There is a "wise prejudice" formed. Strategies to reduce smoking are then put into effect even before the precise causation is fully understood.<br><br>Or again, it is discovered that poorer people have worse health outcomes on average. Therefore you prioritize them in terms of preventative measures. That is a "wise prejudice".<br><br><br><b>A month of decadence</b><br><br>The time has come to "bring back wise prejudice".<br><br>Prejudice is neutral. What you must avoid is unreasonable or irrational prejudice. And when it is not open to argument prejudice can be positively pernicious. That is what has given prejudice a bad name. But "wise prejudice" that is based on common sense, moral principle or empirical fact is essential. And how we need such prejudice today.<br><br>During May it seems that Britain under a new Government has embarked on a month of decadence. We, surely, must develop prejudices against what is going on. But we have been brain-washed into thinking that any prejudice is always wrong. Our defences are, therefore, down.<br><br>Sadly there has been little public opposition to what is happening. This is due to a number of factors. It is partly due to the demise of the leaderless Conservative Party - itself rejected at the General Election for its own sleaze and moral equivocation. But it is also due to the electronic media that for some time now has lead the way in moral innovation and is unlikely to lead any opposition. It is also due to the collapse of moral education in our schools and universities. As George Will says, there is nothing so vulgar left in our experience for which we cannot transport some professor from somewhere to justify it. Then, and importantly, it is due to an absence of moral leadership from the Church at large, with few leaders willing to articulate a biblical position. The result is that the New Labour Government appears, in its early days, to be overseeing an escalating growth of moral insensitivity and blatant evil.<br><br><br><b>Insensitivity to vice</b><br><br>First, a senior cabinet minister has been appointed who by his earlier adultery had destroyed the marriage of a man who is now to be one of his new cabinet colleagues and has married that colleague's wife.<br><br>We are becoming insensitive to vice! What would John the Baptist say, if he were alive today? What would Burke say? He actually said on one occasion: "Vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all its grossness." Are we not in danger of allowing vice to lose its grossness? Here is an older near contemporary of Burke - the poet Alexander Pope. He wrote this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,As to be hated needs but to be seen;Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,We first endure, then pity, then embrace.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is happening at the moment.<br><br>Of course there is forgiveness for everyone and every sin; but some past sins mean that certain doors in the future are closed to you. If there is repentance, you are still accepted and God makes new with new possibilities. But you cannot just act as though nothing had happened in the past. <br><br><br><b>A gay agenda</b><br><br>Then there is another cabinet minister who as a campaigning homosexual is committed to removing Clause 28. What will that mean? It will mean that children will be positively indoctrinated with gay propaganda in schools as they were in some areas in the 1970's and 80's. That was the reason Clause 28 was introduced originally- to protect children.<br><br>In a similar vein, the new Home Secretary has promised a free vote on reducing the age of homosexual consent to 16. And we know that in the Gay Lobby there is a desire to reduce the age of consent to 14. In America there are those who want it reduced below 10! A National Book Award winner writes, "Nine and a half is old enough for me at least."<br><br>Also there is the issue of Tony Blair in Europe. Unless there is massive counter action over the next two weeks, moral damage may be done outside Parliament. People need to write to Tony Blair and lobby so that a gay rights amendment to the Treaty of the European Community is not passed at the Inter Government Conference in Amsterdam on 16 and 17 June.<br><br>Already Labour MEPs have helped to pass in February 1994 a motion in the European Parliament calling on the European Commission, "as a minimum" (§ 14), to seek to end:</p>

<blockquote><div>the barring of lesbian and homosexual couples from marriage or from an equivalent legal framework, and should guarantee the full rights and benefits of marriage, allowing the registration of partnerships, </div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>any restrictions on the rights of lesbians and homosexuals to be parents or to adopt or foster children.</div></blockquote>

<p> Cleverly the "spin doctors" kept this vote from the British Public. The Pope tried to publicize what was going on, but with not much success. Most of the Labour MEP's present voted for homosexual marriage and to allow lesbian and homosexual adoption and fostering.<br><br>It has come as no surprise, therefore, with the new "feel" in the air following the election of the new Government, that there have been further erosions of our moral fabric.<br><br><br><b>Moral confusion</b><br><br>At the beginning of the month, I was asked to take part in a Central TV programme featuring two Lesbians, one of whom had inseminated herself from a gay sperm donor. It was also reported about that time that the Health Authorities in Hartlepool were providing fertility treatment for Lesbian women.<br><br>Then there was the Karen Roche case. A Dutch couple, Mr and Mrs Peeters, were unable, because of Dutch law, to find a commercial surrogate in Holland for a baby. So they came to Britain to find a woman who would do what was necessary for £12,000 expenses. Karen Roche, the woman involved, then successively claimed and denied that she had aborted the baby. Eventually she said that she would keep it. She then, we are told, decided to hand the child over - half the product of the Peeters - to another couple. There was another twist, even, after that. What a start for a human life!<br><br>There then followed a report in The Times on 21 May that ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... a girl of 11 has been adopted by a woman living with a lesbian partner after a ground-breaking ruling by a High Court judge, who overruled objections from the child's natural mother.</div></blockquote>

<p>At the end of the month there were the Kellys fighting over whether to abort their child or not. They were followed by a gay couple, Russell Conlon and his partner Stephen trying to find a surrogate mother to have a baby for them. "We feel that the love and respect that a child brings would complete our lives. We all have the right to have children."<br><br><br><b>The face of Evil</b><br><br>Something not only sick but quite evil is going on. Children are being treated as commodities. They are now, in effect, being bought and sold. They can be dispensed with if adult circumstances require it. And they are now being seen, by so many, simply as a means to adult happiness.<br><br>So why should we be surprised to discover, on 23 May 1997, that a professional carer is jailed for abusing children? North Tyneside Social Services sent him children to foster knowing that he was a homosexual child abuser as did other authorities.<br><br>A more sophisticated event happened the day before at the Newcastle upon Tyne Church High School Governors' meeting. With myself the only dissident, the Governors unanimously have endorsed a gay rights equal opportunities policy. This is not required by the Race Relations Act of 1976, the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 or the Disability Discrimination Act of 1996. I said I would have to make by dissent public. [Note: in October 1997 the Governors unanimously revoked this decision].<br><br>In the words of the title of a new best seller in the US we are "Slouching Towards Gomorrah"!<br><br><br><b>Children first</b><br><br>In all of these issues there is the plain teaching of the Bible - whether this relates to marriage, adultery and divorce, or to homosexual relationships.<br><br>The Bible is clear. Heterosexual monogamous marriage is a universal good - it is a creation ordinance. It is God's arrangement for healthy living and happy families - a man and a woman in an exclusive relationship for life. In all societies it is best for the care and nuture of children. Healthy marriages produce a stable society. That is what we need to have a prejudice about, because it is a wise prejudice.<br><br>But in the 1960's the Western World was told that those prejudices were to be discarded. That has resulted in dysfunctional children, dysfunctional relationships and a dysfunctional society.<br><br>Study after study shows that children brought up in lesbian and gay households do suffer. What is so pernicious is that there appears to be straight dishonesty in this area. On another occasion I will document the evidence. We need to recover prejudices - rational prejudices in favour of the traditional family and against immorality.<br><br><br><b>The way ahead</b><br><br>But what can a Christian do?<br><br>First, challenge, as you can, every defiance of God's law. This, of course, does not mean nit-picking. But today there are such blatant follies and wickedness that call for objection. In a democratic society you have a Christian duty to act. You can write to MP's and ministers. There will be good men and women in the New Labour Government who are just waiting for a clear indication of public opinion that they can follow up. At present most of the running is made by those who want to destabilise morality.<br><br>Secondly, pray. God alone is "sufficient for these things."<br><br>Thirdly, evangelise. Charles Coulson has recently said:</p>

<blockquote><div>Most of us fail to realise that the battle of ideas being waged ...- eupehmistically known as the culture war - is merely a symptom. We Christians invest enormous amounts of energy running to fight this battle here or that battle there. But we can never win the culture war that way. What we have to do is attack the deeper cause of the cultural conflict.</div></blockquote>

<p>He goes on to argue that we need to recover the truth - the truth as it is in the bible. That involves hard work. We have to think. And, indeed, "wise prejudices" must be regularly re-examined and, if necessary, reinforced.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The State of the Nation">(July 1997) The State of the Nation</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>July 1997</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>

How do you check on the health of a nation?<br><br>For a society to be healthy, you need a good economic order; you need a good political order; but you also need a good moral and spiritual order. It is like a three-legged stool. Today we are trying to exclude one of those elements of life - spiritual order. You now can have a novel about Jesus, entitled Quarantine (and just published) that is blasphemous, "thoroughly and deliberately heretical," in the words of one reviewer, with "Jesus ... a weak, gangling, semi-literate hysterical adolescent" and a thief - and no one bats an eyelid! <br><br>It was Jesus himself who said, quoting the Old Testament, that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Yes, the Christian faith is being excluded from our public culture. But the majority do not want that. The opinion polls show that the lead in the de-Christianizing of our nation is being taken not by the majority but by a minority who have influence in the media, the therapeutic services and education.<br><br>You all know about education. I needn't mention the state of Christian Assemblies and RE in our schools; and the de-Christianizing that is going on in our schools. But where there is a Christian School, like Emmanuel Gateshead - a Christian City Technology College - it not only is among the best in the country in terms of the inspection and performance league tables [and that when it is serving an inner city area] but also the parents - working class parents - are desperate to get their children enrolled. Given the choice most parents want their children at least to have the option of rejecting the Christian faith. But our education is being de-Christianized.<br><br>Yesterday I was in the United States. It is the same there. A best selling book by William Strauss and Neil Howe called The Fourth Turning argues that the United States "feels like it's unravelling." The authors go on:</p>

<blockquote><div>Though we live in an era of relative peace and comfort, we have settled into a mood of pessimism about the long-term future, fearful that our superpower nation is somehow rotting from within.</div></blockquote>

<p>Neither an epic victory over Communism nor an extended upswing of the business cycle can buoy our public spirit ... We yearn for civic character but satisfy ourselves with symbolic gestures and celebrity circuses. We perceive no greatness in our leaders, a new meanness in ourselves. Small wonder that each new election brings anew jolt, its aftermath a new disappointment.<br><br>Britain is a mirror image of the United States in fundamental areas of public life. True we have many different traditions. But America, as Talcott Parsons described it, is the "lead society". It often gets there first: we get there in the end.<br><br>Someone, no doubt, is saying "this is all alarmism. Have there not often been times of public self-doubt in previous generations?" I therefore need to be specific. I want to take the case of children and young people. You only have to see what is happening to our children to realise that something must be done.<br><br><br><b>Pscychosocial Disorders in Young People</b><br><br>Two years ago Sir Michael Rutter, a Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in London, and David Smith, a Professor of Criminology in Edinburgh proved there were, indeed, serious issues that we ignore to our peril. They showed that what common sense knows, serious study now confirms. In their publication, entitled Psychosocial Disorders in Young People (a massive 843 page book), they edited a multinational collection of papers on young people's problems researched by a group of leading European and American scholars. The findings are frightening. The authors focus on disorders that are increasing in the teenage years: crime, suicide, suicidal behaviour, depression, anorexia and bulimia, alcohol and drug abuse. At the launch of the book, Sir Michael Rutter claimed that</p>

<blockquote><div>this is the first major study to highlight the upward trend in psychosocial disorders of youth since the Second World War across the most developed countries. It is striking [he went on] that this increase in psychosocial disorders happened at a time when physical health was improving." </div></blockquote>

<p>David Smith added:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is also striking that a major increase in psychosocial disorders happened in the 'golden era' of low unemployment and rising living standards between 1950 and 1973. Increasing psychosocial disorders are not related to deprivation or to increasing affluence in any simple way.</div></blockquote>

<p>The key findings were these.<br><br>First, in Britain, the rate of recorded crime (mostly committed by young people) increased tenfold from 1950 to 1993; and over that period there were substantial increases in psychosocial disorders of young people - this is also true in nearly all developed countries. But these increases of the past 50 years were sudden increases. There had been no similar increases earlier in the century. And, very importantly, as psychosocial disorders were increasing, physical health was improving.<br><br>Secondly, in most countries alcohol consumption increased greatly among the young between 1950 and 1980, with deaths from cirrhosis of the liver increasing in a similar way, as did alcohol-related problem behaviours.<br><br>Thirdly, with regard to drugs, national surveys in the United States show that the illicit use of drugs and drug dependency were very low for those born in 1940, but increased for each successive birth cohort afterwards. And Western European countries, like the United States have similarly experienced a massive increase in drug use and abuse since 1950.<br><br>Fourthly, there is suicide. In Europe, rates of suicide have increased over the whole of the twentieth century, but the most striking increase was among young males between 1970 and 1990.<br><br>And fifthly, there has also been a substantial increase in the proportion of the population suffering from depressive disorders, as shown by a wide range of studies carried out in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Britain.<br><br>What do these authors think are the causes? Rutter and Smith note that the poor, the unemployed, and people living on "sink estates" are more likely to be criminal, depressed, suicidal, and addicted to drugs, than those in more comfortable circumstances. Yet, they argue, worsening living conditions cannot account for rising levels of crime, suicide, depression, alcohol and drug abuse in young people. This is because the rise was most marked during a period of two to three decades in which living conditions improved. Between 1950 and 1973 there was a "golden era" of economic growth, low unemployment, and improving living conditions throughout the developed world. But this coincided with the post-war rise in psychological disorders. Also, high unemployment in the 1930s was not associated with rises in crime, suicide, or drug abuse.<br><br><br><b>The causes</b><br><br>So what are the causes?<br><br>One, there is the clear suggestion that levels of family discord and break-up may well have played a role in the rise of psychosocial disorders. Norman Dennis has virtually proved this suggestion as correct. Norman Dennis, the internationally renowned social scientist from Newcastle University and who has written and spoken for the Christian Institute, a Socialist (and not some one on the right wing of the Tory party it must be added), argues that the crime and social disorder of our inner cities are not to be analysed primarily in terms of poverty but in terms of family breakdown - the breakdown of the traditional pattern of a married father and mother providing security and stability for their insecure and unstable young and themselves committed to each other for life.<br><br>A second cause is sexual experimentation. Alongside adolescent "isolation" and a desire for independence, young people (say Rutter and Smith) "may be more stressed by early sexual experiences and the break-up of love relationships." This, of course, is the damage caused by sexual promiscuity and experimentation. It is not really clever; it is emotionally damaging; and it does not lead, long term, to sexual satisfaction. We now have other research that confirms that those most satisfied with their sexual lives and the most sexually adjusted are those who keep to biblical standards. The massive and recent Sex in America survey found that those who had the most fun in bed were married Conservative Protestants - this was mind-blowing for the researchers.<br><br>So to sum up: academic child psychiatrists, criminologists and social scientists are now saying that the serious problems they are identifying among the young are fundamentally moral.<br><br>But how do you change moral behaviour? The tragedy with so many is to propose a new moralism. But that will not work. The moral reality is that men and women do not do what is right by nature. The Bible calls that the results of the Fall. We all sin. And if you don't believe anything else in the Bible, you have to believe that. The evidence is all around you today. And there has been evidence down the centuries of history. You cannot tell people to pull themselves up morally by their moral bootlaces. It just does not work. They need the love of God the Father, the forgiveness of Jesus Christ at his Cross and the power of the Holy Spirit for new life.<br><br>If you reject the Fatherhood of God as people are doing today, before long you will find you have lost the Brotherhood of man. You can cut a plant off from its roots. It can last only for a period in a vase of water. Then it dies.<br><br>A recent study by Christie Davies, Professor of Sociology at Reading, entitled Moralisation and Demoralisation: a moral explanation for changes in crime, disorder and social problems shows how this works out. He has studied not just the last 50 years, like Rutter and Smith, but the last 150 years. He has charted the same rise in crime and social disorder over the last fifty years that Rutter and Smith highlight but also the fall in crime and disorder at the end of the 19th century.<br><br>He too shows that you cannot blame the current slide into lawlessness on conditions such as bad housing, poverty or unemployment. For there was far more of all three in the earlier part of the 20th century but very little crime. In fact there has been a U-curve. The overall incidence of serious offences recorded by the police in the 1890s was only about 60 per cent of what it had been in the 1850s and, given that the efficiency of the reporting and recording of crime was improving at the time, the real fall in the crime rate was probably far greater. The facts are clear: by 1900 Britain was not only a less violent and less dishonest country than today, but also less violent and less dishonest than it had been in the earlier part of the 19th century. What was the cause?<br><br><br><b>The key to change</b><br><br>The answer is religious revival and the related remoralisation of society; for these two things led to a heightening of conscience and an increase of self-control. Isn't this so relevant for today? Christie Davies has this comment on today:</p>

<blockquote><div>For the Left the villain is capitalism and for the Right it is welfare; both are ways of avoiding the conclusion that wicked and irresponsible choices are made by wicked and irresponsible individuals.</div></blockquote>

<p>The watershed was the 1960s when there was a new theology and a new morality. People claimed "God is dead"; homosexual behaviour was legalised; pornography was no longer "pornography" but "adult or authentic expression" and regular fare in the cinema and on TV; and society began to fall apart. Things were different before the 1960s. Go back to 1955. In 1955 Geoffrey Gorer in his Exploring English Character commented:</p>

<blockquote><div>... in public life today, the English are certainly among the most peaceful, gentle, courteous and orderly populations that the civilised world has ever seen.</div></blockquote>

<p>But what were the roots of that "peaceful" life? Answer: the Christian faith; and foremost was the Sunday School ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... whose enrolments [says Davies] rose as the incidence of deviant behaviour fell in the late 19th century. Significantly, the numbers enrolled in and the influence of this institution then fell in the years prior to the reversal of the U-curve of deviance which has produced Britain's present high level of moral problems.</div></blockquote>

<p>By 1888 about three out of every four children in England and Wales attended Sunday school, "a remarkable proportion when it is remembered that parents of the higher social groups did not particularly favour attendance." Wales which had been one of the more violent and lawless parts of Britain, became in the later 19th century an especially peaceful and law-abiding country. But it was precisely in Wales that Sunday schools organised by non-conformist chapels were at their strongest. Let me summarise with a quote from Professor Christie Davies:</p>

<blockquote><div>it is pointless to ask whether children became moral and respectable as a result of the teaching they received in Sunday school, or whether the key factor was the pre-existing aspirations of their parents who sent them there. What is important is that these reinforced one another and that any potential delinquents were confronted on all sides and from all sources with the consistent moral view that forms of antisocial behaviour with clear and direct harmful consequences such as violence, theft, illegitimacy and drunkenness were quite simply wrong.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>"Enough is enough"</b><br><br>At some point we have to say, "enough is enough". Sunday was Father's day. Those who are Fathers must ensure something better for their children. This past month has seen and unbelievable slide into a new moral decadence. Nor is there much opposition. There is no opposition in Parliament where many now seem to be validating immorality. There is no opposition in the electronic media where many are usually among the first to lead the way in terms of moral innovation. There is no opposition - or little opposition - in our schools or universities. As George Will has said, </p>

<blockquote><div>there is nothing so vulgar left in our experience for which we cannot transport some professor from somewhere to justify it. </div></blockquote>

<p>Sadly, there is little opposition from leaders in the Church. Of course, there is forgiveness at the cross of Christ for every sin. Jesus for gave an adulteress; but he said, "Go and sin no more". He didn't say, "go and change the law to fit your behaviour!" We are becoming insensitive to sin and evil. What would John the Baptist say if he was alive today. It was because of Herod's immoralities that John was beheaded. Alexander Pope once wrote these lines:</p>

<blockquote><div>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,As to be hated needs but to be seen;Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,We first endure, then pity, then embrace.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is happening at the moment.<br><br>Take the Secretary of State at the Heritage Ministry. He is a campaigning homosexual committed to removing Clause 28. What will that mean? It will mean that children will be positively indoctrinated with gay propaganda in our schools as they were in some areas in the 1970s and 1980s. That was the reason Clause 28 was introduced. It was introduced originally to protect children.<br><br>Take the new Home Secretary. He has promised a free vote on reducing the age of homosexual consent to 16. And we know that in the Gay Lobby there is a desire to reduce the age of consent to 14. In America there are those who want it reduced to 10! A National Book Award winner writes, "Nine and a half is old enough for me at least."<br><br>Take the new government and the gay rights amendment to the Treaty of the European Community it has literally just signed up to. That is consistent with the Labour MEPs who voted for Gay Marriage and Gay adoption in a European Parliament motion in February 1994. Cleverly their "spin doctors" kept this from the British Public.<br><br>Of course, these sexual sins are not the worst sin in the book, but in Romans 1 we are told that when men and women reject God, homosexual and lesbian behaviour is one of the first consequences.<br><br><br><b>May 1997</b><br><br>At the beginning of May I had to take part in a Central TV programme featuring two lesbians, one of whom had inseminated herself from a gay sperm donor.<br><br>There then followed a report in The Times on 21 May that:</p>

<blockquote><div>... a girl of 11 has been adopted by a woman living with a lesbian partner after a ground-breaking ruling by a High Court judge, who overruled objections from the child's natural mother.</div></blockquote>

<p>And last Tuesday I took part in a BBC Heart of the Matter TV debate that I believe was screened on Sunday. Among others I was arguing with one Russell Conlon who with his homosexual lover Stephen is trying to find a surrogate mother to have a baby for them. "We feel", I quote, "that the love and respect that a child brings would complete our lives. We all have the right to have children."<br><br>Something is not only sick, but quite evil. It is positive evil that is being tolerated. Children are being treated as commodities. They are now, in effect, being bought and sold. They can be acquired or dispensed with according to adult requirements. They are now being seen, by many, simply as a means to adult happiness.<br><br>Let me added categorically that study after study shows, if you take a careful look at the research, that children brought up in lesbian and gay households do suffer. What is so pernicious because children are involved is the unwillingness to face up to facts. Do not listen to what is false or misleading from the gay movement. <br><br>So why should we be surprised to discover just a week or two ago that a professional carer is jailed for abusing children and with a number of Social Services having sent him children to foster, with himself having been on a adoption and fostering panel. And all the while people knew that he was a homosexual child abuser.<br><br>Of course, we must love and help every person in their sexual temptations - whether heterosexual or homosexual. But we must face the facts. And we must urge celibacy. Many in our churches have temptations to all sorts of illicit sex. It is not being tempted that is wrong. It is glorying in the sin. That is what we have all around us - the glorification of sin. It is time for anger - righteous anger. In the words of another US best seller, we are "Slouching towards Gomorrah!"<br><br>In the airport at Orlando, Florida, yesterday I picked up a British Sunday paper. What did I read:</p>

<blockquote><div>Police let sex offender work with boys - a police force has decided not to tell the organisers of a boys' club that they have a convicted paedophile working for them, because they fear the man will sue the force ... The force in question has decided that it will not inform the club, nor any of the parents of the children in his care, because it is worried that the man will launch a legal action against the police if they reveal his past (Sunday Telegraph 15.6.97)</div></blockquote>

<p>In all of these issues there is the plain teaching of the Bible - whether this relates to marriage, adultery and divorce, or to homosexual relationships. The Bible is clear. Heterosexual monogamous marriage is a universal good - it is a creation ordinance. It is God's arrangement for healthy living and happy families - a man and a woman in an exclusive relationship for life. In all societies it is best for the care and nurture of children. Healthy marriages produce a stable society. But since the 1960s we have ignored the Bible in the Western World. The result, as we have seen, is dysfunctional children, dysfunctional relationships and a dysfunctional society.<br><br><br><b>A Christian response</b><br><br>So what can Christians do?<br><br>First, respond to the challenge. I came across this six part manifesto not so long ago.<br><br>Let me give it to you:</p>

<blockquote><div>1) Realize the great heritage that Christianity has afforded Western civilization.2) Admit that an unfounded bias has arisen against analysis from a Christian perspective.3) Acknowledge that the Bible does not teach us to abandon the world but rather saturate it with a Christian vision.4) Realize that education is now a battlefield.5) Categorically reject the notion of neutrality - it fosters the denial of absolute truth.6) Develop an integrated Christian view because Jesus Christ is the solution to mankind's problems. </div></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, in this climate of relativism and multi-faith indifferentism, affirm the uniqueness of Jesus Christ. The claim to the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ is a truth claim and, therefore, a question of fact. That is why all claims cannot be right. Peter Cotterell puts it like this:<br><br>Islam says Jesus wasn't crucified. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Judaism says Jesus was not the Messiah. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Hinduism says that God has often been incarnate. We say only once. And we can't both be right. Buddhism says that the world's miseries will end when we do what's right. We say, you can't do what's right: the world's miseries will end when we believe what is right.<br><br>The fact is that the world's religions may agree about the peripheral matters but they disagree precisely about the most important matters of all. Any intelligent person could decide that all religions are wrong. Any intelligent person could decide that one is right and the rest wrong. But no intelligent person can seriously believe that all religions are essentially the same.<br><br>Nor is this Western triumphalism. To say that Christ is unique is not to say that other cultures are always and in everything inferior; nor is it to say even that Christian activities are unique. The uniqueness simply lies in the one in whom Christians believe in. It is Christ who is unique, not the West, nor his followers.<br><br><br><b>The Law of the Harvest</b><br><br>Thirdly, learn from Hosea chapter 8 verse 7 where it says:</p>

<blockquote><div>They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. </div></blockquote>

<p>The 1960s generation sowed the wind. Earlier this century certain famous members of the rich and leisured classes had sowed the wind of decadence and so undermined our culture and the faith of many. But without the electronic media and the 1944 Education Act, their decadence spread only slowly. There was not then such a whirlwind. But in the 1960s there was the electronic media and the 1944 Education Act was having its impact. Many of us were part of that generation that sowed the wind - I certainly was. I was a student from 1958 to 1964 and then 1965 to 1967. The consequences of that sowing are the whirlwinds that our young people have now inherited and experience that I have outlined. But now that very generation - my generation - are in positions of government and national leadership. That is why there is little confidence in our leadership - sadly in the wider Church as well as in the State. But Hosea also says something else about sowing - in chapter 10 verse 12:</p>

<blockquote><div>Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unploughed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers righteousness on you.</div></blockquote>

<p>There is a law of the harvest. The Bible is so clear - that law is not only true of the natural world but also of the spiritual and moral world. What you sow you reap; and you reap far more than you sow. The consequences now from the 60s are so damaging. But we can be confident that the consequences of God's people being faithful now will be out of all proportion to their effort. That is the "gospel" or the good news of the harvest. As Hosea says, we need to seek the Lord. So the first thing all of us must do is pray.<br><br>The second thing, as Hosea says, is to break up the unploughed - or fallow - ground. That is what the Christian Institute is all about. Yes, the Holy Spirit can work without our help, but so often he wants us to take action.<br><br>We need to preach the word - that the problems of society are fundamentally those of sin - the rejection of God and his will for us; that Christ alone is the saviour from sin; and that the Holy Spirit gives new life - those great 3 "Rs" - ruin, redemption and regeneration. But we also have to be obedient to the claims of God's righteousness. The law has to be understood before the Gospel can be seen as necessary. The law, says Paul, is our school-master to bring us to Christ.<br><br>Breaking up the unploughed land will mean campaigning and getting involved in the many issues the Christian Institute is involved in. It will mean supporting the Christian Institute financially if you can. It will mean standing up in a minority of one at work, at your college, in the council chamber and sometimes sadly in our churches for Christ and his standards. Then there must be a sowing of righteousness. Christians need to be in the forefront not just of those who complain, but of those who make positive changes for good. They must set up new schools that are as good as any in the country; they must set up new Christian Radio and TV stations, new Christian adoption and fostering agencies, new work among the elderly and above all new churches like this one that will have influence. They must aggressively stop the evil of abortion, work for a rolling back of the divorce culture, a rolling back of the national lottery and all the other immoral legislation enacted by the Conservative government. They must network. They must, says God through Hosea, "sow righteousness".<br><br><br><b>On all fronts</b><br><br>We have to work on all fronts.<br><br>Our motto at Jesmond Parish Church is "Godly Living, Church Growth, Changing Britain" <br><br>Conversion is where it all begins. Then converted people have to be in Christian fellowships - that means that if there is evangelism there must be church growth. But if everything that the new convert learns on Sunday is denied on Monday morning in the public world, his or her faith will not be strengthened. And the public world will be, as we have shown, gradually destroyed. But above all God will not be glorified. That surely must be the goal of all we do - to give God the glory. He has done great things for us. What are we going to do for him? That is the question the Christian Institute challenges us with this evening.<br><br>How will you respond? I want you to respond by saying, "yes, I will, in God's strength, stand up to be counted." Evil so often prevails when good men and women do nothing.<br><br>Don't be an unrealistic optimist. Things are not good in our Nation. And things may have to get worse before they can get better. But don't be a realistic pessimist with no hope. Be a realistic optimist. Fact the facts recognise the problems, but then be confident for our God does reign and Jesus Christ is victorious over sin, death and all the forces of the evil one.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The United States, Marriage and Abstinence Education">(August 1997) The United States, Marriage and Abstinence Education</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 1997</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>So much of the news is bad news. That is why it is good to keep abreast of the good news. Paul once spoke of "whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right" (Philippians 4.8). Reading the Spring 1997 "Sexual Health Update" from the Medical Institute for Sexual Health recently, I came across some encouraging good news. Let me summarise and abridge the core information in that Update. (And for those who want the web site of the Medical Institute for Sexual Health it is "<a href="http://www.mish.org">http://www.mish.org</a>")<br><br><br><b>The United States Welfare Reform Act 1996</b><br><br>The focus of the Update was on something very interesting going on in the United States and that has not been reported in our own media. It has therefore never been allowed to influence our own thinking here in the UK.<br><br>On 22 August last summer (1996) President Clinton signed into law the "Personal Responsibility Act of 1996". This had been passed by Congress to protect American young people from sexually transmitted diseases and from non-marital pregnancies.<br><br>The more common name for this Act is the Welfare Reform Act. The Spring Sexual Health Update described this legislation as ...</p>

<blockquote><div>an attempt to address problems that have developed since various welfare programmes began in the 1960s. As you know, many welfare recipients have been trapped on welfare long-term, often extending across generations.</div></blockquote>

<p>One major concern is the large and growing numbers of single parents applying for and staying on welfare. Many have felt that welfare has even fostered and encouraged greater numbers of non-marital families. The welfare reform legislation is an attempt to provide encouragement and support for those needing assistance to consider it as a a temporary measure until they can once again fend for themselves.<br><br><br><b>Introduction to the legislation</b><br><br>A number of people testified before the subcommittee that had the task of producing the legislation. Included in this number was Dr Joe McIlhaney of the Medical Institute for Sexual Health. He testified about the impact the current welfare system had on non-marital pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. There are many such pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases among those qualifying for welfare assistance.<br><br>The result of the initiatives of these people was quite remarkable. It significantly affected the outcome of the new Act. Here, for example, is how the Welfare Reform Act begins - and it is quite remarkable:</p>

<blockquote><div>Congress makes the following findings:1. Marriage is the foundation of a successful society. 2. Marriage is an essential institution of a successful society which promotes the interests of children. 3. Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of children.</div></blockquote>

<p>That introduction is, indeed, quite remarkable for today. The legislation then goes on to deal with a wider variety of issues. But most remarkable of all is section 912 at the end.<br><br>It is in this section you can see Congress authorize a spend of $50,000,000 for each of the next five years and specifically for "abstinence education". And these funds can be applied for only by those running abstinence education programmes and also for ...</p>

<blockquote><div>mentoring, counselling, and adult supervision to promote abstinence from sexual activity, with a focus on those groups which are most likely to bear children out-of-wedlock.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Abstinence Education</b><br><br>One of the concerns of the legislation was that the term "abstinence" is now becoming fashionable and is being co-opted by "safer sex" advocates. To stop the use of this money being used for anything other than sexual abstinence outside marriage, the Welfare Reform Act defines "abstinence education" quite precisely:</p>

<blockquote><div>The term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational programme which:A. has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realised by abstaining from sexual activity;B. teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;C. teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;D. teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;E. teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;F. teaches that bearing children out-of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;G. teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increased vulnerability to sexual advances; andH. teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>President Clinton</b><br><br>Earlier this year President Clifton endorsed this section of the Welfare Reform Act in the context of some statistics of teenage pregnancy that had just been released. And he said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>All of you need to help us send the strongest possible message: its' wrong to be pregnant or father a child unless you are married and ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood (New York Times 5 January, 1997).</div></blockquote>

<p>As you would expect, because this legislation carefully prevents those running "safer sex" education programmes from being able to apply for any of this state funding, the consequence is that some "safer sex" advocates are now seeking to undermine the legislation.<br><br>So how we need to pray for the Americans who are endeavouring, with some success, to turn the clock back in these matters. And we need to pray for ourselves - for a similar courage, commitment and dogged determination in this country; and also for an ability to share the vision and practical skills of the Americans.<br><br>We are nowhere so well organized as they are. Christians in the UK are currently rather depressed at the direction many in the wider church seem to be going. The huge homosexualization campaign that is being run by Stonewall and the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement seems to dominate the media. There are so few that seem willing to oppose what is going on.<br><br>But praise God that good things are happening here and there in the US. There is research, there is campaigning and there is a confidence that the Lord reigns, and his purposes are being worked out.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Some Thoughts about the Bible (I)">(September 1997) Some Thoughts about the Bible (I)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Martin Luther the great reformer, once wrote this:</p>

<blockquote><div>The word of God is seldom retained in its purity in any one place beyond the period of twenty or at best forty years. The people become accustomed to it, grow cold in their Christian love, and regard God's gift of grace with indifference.</div></blockquote>

<p>Currently we seem to be in a period when the word of God is not being "retained in its purity". Devaluing the "written" word of God is a key factor in this process. So perhaps from time to time I should write something on issues relating to "the Bible" and its authority. I shall start off with some history.<br><br><br><b>The Reformation period</b><br><br>For the first fifteen centuries of the Church's history there was little public contention. But things came to a head at the time of the Reformation in the 16th century. The Continental and English Reformers were accusing the Roman Church of being "unbiblical". They said Rome was putting church Tradition "over" the Bible. This led to defying the Bible by adding to the mediation of Christ the mediation of Mary and of priests; to ignoring its teaching on the Holy Spirit; and to contradicting its teaching on justification by faith, the sacraments (especially Holy Communion) and the nature of the Church itself.<br><br>J.I.Packer analyses the debate in these terms:</p>

<blockquote><div>In that [Reformation] debate the main issues were the extent, clarity and sufficiency of Scripture.</div></blockquote>

<p>On the first issue Rome said: "The canon of Scripture is known through the church's decision, which when conciliar is infallible (as when the Council of Trent defined the Old Testament apocrypha into the Canon, something never before done)." Protestants said: "The authority of church use and definition, though weighty, is not final nor divine; recognition of canonical Scripture depends ultimately on the covenanted inner witness of the Spirit, whereby the divine source and authority of those books which the church has historically attested to (not, therefore, the apocrypha) is made evident to faith.<br><br>On the second issue Rome said: "Scripture is not self-explanatory, and the Bible reader who does not let the teaching church tell him what the book means will err to his soul's hurt." Protestants said: "Though it is true that God has appointed the preaching of the Word as the prime means of Christian understanding, yet all things necessary to salvation are plain in the biblical text, so that the one who reads attentively, seeking the Spirit's help and comparing Scripture with Scripture, will not be led astray."<br><br>On the third issue Rome said: "Scripture needs to be supplemented by traditions which the church hands down." Protestants replied: "The absence of traditional items (papacy, penances, pilgrimages, what have you) from the Bible argues their non-necessity and probable unsoundness.<br><br>So the debate at the time of the Reformation was fundamentally over the relationship between Scripture and Tradition.<br><br>But it wasn't long before the debate was over the relationship between Scripture and human Reason. The Reformers had stressed the right of private judgment. For them they wanted the freedom to be "under" the Bible and not "under" church Tradition. But there was a danger in this quest for freedom. It came from the assumptions of some Renaissance humanism that produced a loss of the doctrine of sin and a gain in confidence in human potential. This lead to the desire to be free "from" the Bible altogether, rather than to be free "for" the Bible. So it lead to the freedom to disagree with it when you wanted to!<br><br><br><b>Liberal Protestantism and the modern era</b><br><br>Human Reason and neither the Bible nor Tradition was becoming the final authority. Less and less was it said that the human mind needed to be steered by the Bible's teaching. Rather it could sit in judgment on the Bible and work out religious truth for itself. <br><br>And so in the 17th century there were the deists. These said God may have created the world, but he no longer was involved in it; rather it ran under its own natural laws and with no need of any interventions from a "miraculous" God.<br><br>In the 18th century there were the rationalists and Enlightenment philosophers. These denied the possibility of knowledge about the spiritual world. So God couldn't possible reveal himself. The Bible, therefore, whatever else it may be (so they taught), is not primarily God's revelation to this world; rather it is human reflection about God - some of it good, and some of it not so good.<br><br>Then in the 19th century there were the liberals. The "father" of these was Schleiermacher. To side-step the rationalists of the 18th century, he argued that Christianity is essentially not something of the mind or reason at all. Rather it is a feeling of dependence on God. It is an experience. Christian "doctrine" is simply an attempt to put that experience into words. But those words are merely the words of a given age. So they cannot be permanent and theology is not about God but about human feelings concerning the divine.<br><br>And so you come to the 20th century. And sadly many of the leaders in the wider Church today have been indoctrinated in this post-Reformation liberal Protestant tradition. They then confuse (and horrify) many faithful people.<br><br>But happily this century there has been a recovery. Karl Barth is one of those who led the way. He may not have gone far enough but he was hugely important and so has been one of the most significant theologians of this century.<br><br>At one time Karl Barth was a faithful follower of the liberal nineteenth century theologians who had successfully de-gutted the Christian gospel. They held that there was no heaven or hell, sin or atonement and that Christ was not really divine. Richard Niebuhr summed it up when he said they taught that ...</p>

<blockquote><div>A God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of Christ without a cross.</div></blockquote>

<p>Adolf von Harnack (1851-1930) was a good example of these views and Barth happened to be his pupil. Harnack believed that Christianity was a valuable religion; but it was to be summarised in two catch phrases, "the Fatherhood of God" and "the Brotherhood of man". "Let's not fuss about the Resurrection or the empty tomb. Forget the plain record of the Bible. Jesus himself didn't really believe he was the son of God. And the idea that Christ was both God and man is too complicated. Originally there was a simple Galilean gospel - 'the religion of Jesus'. Then Paul came along and complicated it. He made it into the 'religion about Jesus'." These were the sort of the ideas Karl Barth had absorbed as a student.<br><br><br><b>A change of mind</b><br><br>But suddenly Karl Barth changed his mind. He rejected the liberal theology of the nineteenth century and did a complete 'U'-turn. Why did he change? It was not that he first looked afresh at the New Testament evidence and saw that it seemed to contradict the ideas coming from the academic theologians. That wasn't the first thing that happened. No! What happened was this: he discovered one day in August 1914 that almost all of his admired liberal Protestant teachers were supporting the war policy of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These theologians had signed a declaration issued by ninety-three German intellectuals supporting the Kaiser's policies. Among the signatories was none other than Adolf von Harnack. There were also others who were Barth's theological teachers. Here is how Karl Barth recalled this event in later years:</p>

<blockquote><div>Among the signatures I found to my horror the names of nearly all my theological teachers whom up to then I had religiously honoured. Disillusioned by their conduct, I perceived that I should not be able any longer to accept their ethics and dogmatics, their biblical exegesis, their interpretation of history; that at least for me the theology of the nineteenth century had no future.</div></blockquote>

<p>That doesn't answer all the questions. But it underlines the wisdom of Charles Simeon of Cambridge, the great Evangelical leader at the beginning of the 19th century. His attitude to the Bible was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Where the inspired writers speak in unqualified terms, he thinks himself at liberty to do the same; judging that they needed no instruction from him how to propagate the truth. He is content to sit as a learner at the feet of the holy Apostles, and has no ambition to teach them how they ought to have spoken.</div></blockquote>

<p>The believer is to go to the Bible to learn from God. And it was Jesus himself who said: "Father .... you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children" (Matthew 11.25).<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="b) 20:20 Vision, the Church in the Next Millenium">(October 1997) b) 20:20 Vision, the Church in the Next Millenium</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 1997</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>My title is 20:20 vision, the church in the next millennium. The question, therefore, is: "what will the future be like in 2020 if the Lord doesn't first return?"<br><br>There are periods of enormous significance when the future is very unlike the past. Such was a time in the 1780's and 1790's. Who would have dreamt in the 1770's of the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the Evangelical Movement as it developed. Such was a time in the first part of this century. Such was a time in the 1960s, and indeed in the 1980s. Who in the 60s could have predicted the Thatcher - Reagan years and the defeat of Marxism? So you have to be very cautious in talking about possible futures in the church. The safest course is simply to say what will happen if we carry on in the Church of England as we are at present.<br><br>And we must think seriously about these matters. The Church of England has been called the "Tory Party at prayer." That is ominous. If the fortunes of the Church of England are mirrored in those of the Tory Party we must move fast. The chairman of the Christian Institute was predicting the virtual collapse of the Tory Party before the last election with near precision in terms of the size of the Labour majority. I now want to go on record as predicting a similar collapse of the Church of England over the next 25 years unless firm and courageous action is taken by those who seek the good of the Church of England and want the best for our nation. Like the Tory Party the Church of England will not cease to exist; but its usefulness and strength will be very minimal.<br><br><br><b>The national profile</b><br><br>We are living in a time of spiritual degeneration. There is a decline in numbers of attenders at church. In the Church of England the decline in terms of Sunday attendances is about 1 per cent per year. That is not huge, but it is inexorable. Over the eleven year period from 1984 (the year David Jenkins was consecrated bishop) to 1995 the usual Sunday attendances in Anglican Churches went down from 1,182,000 to 1,045,000 ( a 12 percent decline). Only about 2 percent of the population are now in an Anglican church on any given Sunday (with 10 percent plus in church overall). The decline in the number of clergy is even more serious. Nor is the situation better in the other denominations or House Churches. There has been a reported decline in the House Churches.<br><br>But we mustn't confuse beliefs and commitments with the institutional expression of those beliefs and commitments. For what continues to be significant is the overall self-identification of the people of Britain. According to the last Independent Television Commission's survey, Seeing is Believing, just over 72 percent of the population identify themselves as Christian. Only 3 percent are of other faiths. Just over 22 percent are nothing.<br><br>That 3 percent of other faiths, incidentally, shows we are not a pluralist, multifaith country. That is a myth of educationalists, broadcasters and some print journalists who are over represented by that 22 percent who believe nothing. In the words of Richard Neuhaus:<br><br>In recent decades, "pluralism" has become something of a buzz-word. It is variously employed. Often it is used to argue that no normative ethic even of the vaguest and most tentative sort, can be "imposed" in our public life. In practice it means that public policy decisions reflect a surrender of the normal to the abnormal, of the dominant to the deviant.<br><br>We are, of course, still a "Christian" country in terms of our constitution; and until by democratic process it is determined that the majority wish that to change, Christian believers have a public duty to stop the erosion of Christian values and virtues in the public square.<br><br><br><b>Assumptions</b><br><br>But to focus on the next millennium - I begin by making four assumptions. One, we in Reform, are committed to the Western Reformed Catholic tradition of the Christian faith (that indeed is the tradition of Augustine, Luther, Calvin, the English Reformers, the Evangelical leaders of the 18th century, men like Simeon and Ryle in the last century and what we mean by mainstream evangelicalism in the 20th century). Two, we are in the Church of England because its formulas and history have upheld that Western Reformed Catholic tradition. Three, we are concerned for the evangelisation of the nation. And, four, we must look at the future both sociologically from the point of view of society in general; and theologically from the point of view of God's society - the society supernatural. It was Hooker who said that the Church is a society and a society supernatural. You cannot safely ignore either dimension. Therefore we need to begin with the interface of public life and the Church of England. That is best seen in the self-identification of our citizens as revealed by opinion polls.<br><br>A Gallup survey from 1982 and published by the Bible Society in 1983 found that 64 percent identified with the Church of England. In the 1987 survey from the old IBA's (the Independent Broadcasting Authority's) religious department, published as God Watching, the figure was 50 percent. In this latest broadcasting survey from the new ITC in 1993 (that I have already referred to) the figure is 40 percent identifying as Anglican. And a 1996 survey published in British Social Attitudes (13th Report) shows 30 percent identifying as Anglican. That is a decline in people's self-perception as Anglican of 10 percent every few years. In the year 2010 we could expect 10 percent of the population to claim to be Anglican, and by the year 2020 the sense of belonging might be limited to the tiny percentage who attend regularly.<br><br>That would be very serious. For then in no way would the Church of England be the church of the nation. It would be irrelevant whether there were, or were not, bishops in the House of Lords. In terms of social strength the church would be a mere "sect". For many of us that would create great problems.<br><br><br><b>The "magisterial" Reformation</b><br><br>Let me explain. Most of us in Reform are committed to what is called the "magisterial" Reformation [magister is the Latin for "ruler"]. Unlike the more radical Reformers who wanted to establish Christian ghettos of pure churches, the magisterial Reformers like Luther, Calvin, Cranmer and the other great English Reformers of the Church of England (including Hooker) wanted the gospel to relate to the wider realities of life - the secular (or in their jargon "the temporal") as well as the spiritual. So they were quite happy, not for the secular realm to rule the church, but for it to help the church where it could. True, sometimes the balance was wrong. But, in general, I think they were right. The legacy of this today is relevant for evangelism and, in particular, as it is popularly put, "being in the best boat to fish from."<br><br>We believe our task is to share the gospel with the citizens in our nation who live in our areas. So if in the year 2020 the shell that some would call the Church of England is simply a tiny sect and if present trends continue it is a theologically liberal sect at that, can we still be in full communion with that shell? Or put it another way - if there is then a substantial Christian presence in other fellowships in the country that is more biblical, more apostolic and more effective but with whom we are formally "out of communion" by virtue of being identified with that shell, will that be tolerable? I believe the answer is "No!" And the reason is that that shell that some might still call "the Church of England" would not be significantly part of the Western Reformed Catholic tradition. It would have lost the gospel; it would have lost its "magisterial" significance; and it would not in a meaningful sense be the church that was defined by our Reformers, by the Thirty-Nine Articles, by the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, by the Ordinal, by our recent Canons and most importantly by the Worship and Doctrine Measure 1974. That and that alone is the "Established Church".<br><br>We are then in an impossible position. Constitutionally I promised 30 years ago "so to minister the doctrine and sacraments, and the discipline of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Church and Realm hath received the same, according to the commandments of God." And for all of us who are ordained, whatever rite we were ordained under, according to the Worship and Doctrine Measure 1974 the 1662 BCP and Ordinal is still the doctrinal standard.<br><br>So what "this Church and Realm hath received" is not some of the heresy coming from House of Bishops' Reports or Doctrine Commission Reports, but the Western Reformed Catholic tradition that is our great heritage in the Church of England. Supremely it is the tradition of the true and apostolic Church of Christ. That is what Canon A1 says. Therefore, if this shell is not, self evidently, part of the true and apostolic Church of Christ, it cannot be the Church of England that Canon A1 defines.<br><br>In practical terms the shell, then, or the structured Church of England would be rather like the current Orthodox Church in, say, Romania. There you have elegant buildings - but not very well-kept. And very few attend - bar a few elderly people. In England under such a hypothetical scenario, this Church of England shell would survive. It would, however, be of historical rather than spiritual interest to the majority of our citizens. The clergy would be glorified vergers taking a service from whatever politically correct prayer book was then in fashion in a side chapel for any who attended.<br><br><br><b>"Black and white" facts</b><br><br>You say, "this is all opinion polls and surveys. This is Reform scare-mongering - the sort of thing we expect to hear."<br><br>Let me assure you that it is for real! Take the official infant baptism figures available from the latest edition of the CBF's official 1997 Church Statistics. These are "black and white" and matters of fact, not "opinion" or prediction.<br><br>The loss of the pull of the Church of England is mirrored in our infant baptism figures.<br><br>In 1950 67 percent of all babies in England were baptised in the Church of England.<br><br>That means that only 33 percent were not so baptised. These people are now 47 years old. That is to say, the great majority of 47 year olds today (and people who are older) were baptised Anglican.<br><br>In 1960 55 percent of all babies were baptised in the Church of England. That means 45 percent weren't so baptised. These people are now 36 years old. That is to say, of all 36 year olds more than half were baptised in an Anglican church.<br><br>In 1970 it was 47 percent, with 53 percent not being baptised. These people are now 26 years old. Of that age group it is now less than half who were baptised in an Anglican church.<br><br>In 1980 it was 36 percent, with 64 percent not being baptised Anglican. These people are now 16 years old and will be 40 in 2020.<br><br>So in 2020 two thirds of the population who are 40 will not have been baptized as Anglicans.<br><br>In 1990 it was 27 percent, with 73 percent not being baptised as Anglican. These people are now 6 years old, and will be 30 in the year 2020.<br><br>So in 2020 nearly three quarters of the population who are 30 will not have been baptized as Anglicans.<br><br>The latest figures for 1995 are 24 percent, with 76 percent not being baptised Anglican.<br><br>That is a huge difference from 1950 when it was 67 percent baptised and only 33 percent not.<br><br>So in the year 2020 the vast majority of 25 year olds - now over three-quarters - are unlikely to feel any personal attachment to the Church of England. I trust that the point is made.<br><br>And it is simply fact. It is no good burying your head in the sand. Unless something happens, the Church of England as we know it will be marginalised as far as our public culture is concerned. And the process of marginalisation is under way. It is for some of us to take action.<br><br>But, remember, people are still identifying as Christian - 72 percent of them according to that Independent Television Commission. No doubt that will be lower if things continue as they are in 2020, but not necessarily hugely lower. So what is happening?<br><br>One thing that is happening is this: we are now in a period of post-denominationalism. People born after 1960 do not chose a church because of the denominational label. They are in a church either because that is where they were converted, or because the music is good, the preaching is good, the crèche is good, the youth work is good, the small group system is good or something else is good.<br><br><br><b>The denominations</b><br><br>Denominations as we know them are probably going to become things of the past.<br><br>At the time of the Elizabethan Settlement there were no denominations. In terms of its social structure the Church of England was evolving into a federation of churches linked or "connected" together by the crown, the episcopate, a prayer book and the Articles. After the Act of Uniformity of 1662 and the ejection of 2000 presbyterian ministers from their livings, by the beginning of the 18th century denominations inevitably evolved. The Act of Toleration of 1689, at the accession of William and Mary, saw their formal beginning. Originally they too were federations of churches linked or "connected" by whatever made them distinctive - presbyteries, independency, baptismal practice, or the Quaker ethic.<br><br>However, in the 19th century, with the growth of evangelicalism and the missionary movements, there was a change. The denominations became "corporations" rather than "federations". That is to say, they operated "corporately" together for joint activities. So there were the Baptist Missionary Society, the Methodist Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society and the like. There were also other agencies for moral and social welfare work and for education. There were Anglican schools, and Methodist Schools, and Baptist Schools. And this form - the denomination as a "corporation" where a central agency acted on behalf of the whole denomination (or that part of it that had an interest) - lasted until the 1960s.<br><br>Because of the growth of denominational activity in the 19th century - by the denominations acting as corporations - there were inevitably clashes, and the wrong sort of competition, especially on the mission field. This led to the famous Edinburgh World Missionary Conference of 1910. It aimed to set forward world-evangelization. It's main achievement was the beginning of the ecumenical movement and what became the World Council of Churches. But far from lessening the denominational distinctives the ecumenical movement gave encouragement to a new denominational self-consciousness. By the 1950's and early 1960's you probably had the high-point of denominationalism, with people paying a huge attention to "their denomination" and arguing that sound ecclesiology was "the one thing necessary". It is, of course, at this time that the recent and current senior leadership of the Church of England was in training and being formed in ministerial norms and ideals - people like Robert Runcie, John Habgood and George Carey; and also lesser clergy like many of us, myself included, were trained at this time. These people were, and are, thoroughly denominational. And today they find it difficult to think in terms other than those of "the denomination" when they think about "the Church". In the Church of England this was the period of Canon Law revision and the debates about the setting up of synodical government.<br><br><br><b>The 1960's</b><br><br>However, at the same time in the 1960's something else was happening. This was the time of extreme liberal and permissive theology centred (in England) at Cambridge and the Southbank of the Thames in Southwark. John Robinson was the most famous name of these "new theologians" with his book Honest to God. This denied much biblical truth and validated a new morality. Harry Williams, the Dean at Trinity College, Cambridge (and so college chaplain to Prince Charles) argued that if sex outside marriage helped you get integrated that must be Christ's will for you. By the end of the decade Paul Altizer was arguing that God is Dead.<br><br>Michael Ramsey was now Archbishop of Canterbury. In part the present erosion of the Church goes back to him. A brilliant and apparently godly man, he was among the first, in a high profile position, to espouse the principle of affirming truth without denying error. He would not condemn heresy, while being personally, and often helpfully, orthodox. One of the great gurus who influenced and under girded this new "comprehensiveness" of Ramsey was F.D.Maurice. But this comprehensiveness was new in the Anglican tradition. Hooker would only have comprehensiveness in matters of church order, never in matters of fundamental doctrine. There had always been latitudinarianism - but nothing like the "anything goes" that Ramsey tolerated.<br><br>At this time, in the words of the former Dean of Salisbury, Fenton Morley, "the heart was taken out of the Church of England"; and indeed there were parallels in the other denominations. These radical theological innovations meant the evaporation of the old consensus from which the denominations "as corporations" could work on behalf of those they represented. No longer could the denominations work as corporations.<br><br>So now the denominations had to change into something else. And they did so. From being federations and then being corporations, the denominations - and this was true of most of them, not just the Church of England - now became "regulatory agencies". This meant they became more centralised and saw their function mainly as holding budgets and telling people what they could and could not do.<br><br>The result of this change to becoming regulatory agencies has been a significant denominational break down.<br><br><br><b>Denominational breakdown</b><br><br>The churches are "voluntary non-profit organizations". They are not "non-voluntary non-profit organizations" like Government departments and Local Authorities that have penal sanctions to enforce action. Nor are they "voluntary for-profit organizations" like businesses that have financial power to enforce action. Being "voluntary non-profit organizations" they have no sanctions and no power - certainly as far as the laity is concerned. Motivation is everything. <br><br>But the new denominations - or the denominations in their new form - cannot motivate. Laymen who are bible-believing and can administer multi-million (even billion) pound companies, or perform sophisticated surgical operations, or lead modern educational institutions, do not take kindly to less than brilliant clergy (even if they are bishops or moderators) or to clericalised laymen telling them, from denominational headquarters, what to believe or how much to give in support of causes they disapprove of.<br><br>This has led to the denominations becoming quite dysfunctional. With the erosion of the consensus their future is secured only so long as there are certain functions they still control and that the clergy are dependent on. This is fundamentally matters of stipend and pension - hence the near panic at the centre at quota-capping or the suggestion that the local congregation should be formally responsible, as it once was, for stipend and pension, or, indeed, buildings.<br><br>In the aftermath of the denominational high point of the 60s, while the pervasive church consciousness was still very "denominational", there was a massive centralization taking place. Synodical Government facilitated this process. In particular it related to stipends in the Church of England with the setting up of the Central Stipends Authority in the 1970s, initially on the grounds that this would be more convenient for everyone. But with the devaluation of central subsidies, de facto if not de jure these payments are once again the responsibility of the local congregation. Before long, certainly in the Church of England, pensions will also be the responsibility of the local congregation. At that point what will be the function of the centre?<br><br>Many would say "for training the next generation of ministers."<br><br>But that training itself is now dysfunctional. Originally, ordination training was pluralistic. In the Church of England in the last century and until the second world war, it had operated as a "free market".<br><br>This was particularly because the different traditions - anglo-catholic and evangelical - insisted on training their own men in their own way. And in output terms, it was successful. Now numbers are low, not least because young men have lost confidence in the way the denominational churches are evolving. But is not all this too pessimistic a picture?<br><br><br><b>Pannenberg and Willimon</b><br><br>Let me quote to you from the distinguished German theologian, Wolfhart Pannenberg, to prove that this analysis is not unique. He is talking about secularism. He says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Secularism's greatest success, however, is in the widespread demoralization in the ranks of the clergy and theologians who are supposed to proclaim and interpret the truth of the Gospel but delude themselves that they are achieving that purpose by adapting Christian faith and life to the demands of secularism. What the situation requires, I am convinced, is precisely the opposite of such uncritical adaptations.</div></blockquote>

<p>The farther secularism advances the more urgent it is that Christian faith and life be seen in sharp contrast to the secularist culture ...<br><br>What is needed is a strong reaffirmation of the central articles of Christian faith against the spirit of secularism, and then a joining of that to a renewed commitment to rationality and ecumenical openness. Needless to say, such a combination is not easy. It is quite possible that in the early part of the 3rd millennium, only the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches, on the one hand, and Evangelical Protestantism, on the other, will survive as ecclesial communions. What used to be called the Protestant Mainline Churches are in acute danger of disappearing. I expect they will disappear if they continue neither to resist the Spirit of a progressively secularist culture nor to try to transform it.<br><br>And that is not a member of the Council of Reform but Wolfhart Pannenberg.<br><br>And here is William Willimon, another distinguished academic, from the United States this time, dean of chapel and professor of Christian ministry at Duke University. He is referring to the Protestant Mainline denominations:</p>

<blockquote><div>One of the big stories we are witnessing is the dismantling of national denominations. We have been slashing national staffs due to huge budgetary problems. Some of our concern about the national denominations will dissipate due to this dismantling of bureaucracies. We're seeing a move to the local, to the congregational ... We've seen the end of denominationalism as we know it, although not the end of some kind of chastened denominationalism. It may be a stripping down for service. I don't meet any young adults interested in feeding national organizations.</div></blockquote>

<p>So what do we do?<br><br><br><b>Hard decisions</b><br><br>There have to be some hard decisions. The time for talking has come to an end. We need to act. This is what are brothers and sisters are doing now in other parts of the Anglican Communion - not least across the Atlantic. Let's learn from them. And we need to act in five ways.<br><br>First, we need to act in regard to homosexuality. We need to align ourselves with Resolution 4 of the First Promise Statement of the evangelicals in ECUSA [the Episcopal Church of the USA] in their endorsement of the recent resolution of the Province of South East Asia. I quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>We intend to "be in communion with that part of the Anglican Communion which accepts and endorses the principles aforesaid [the "Kuala Lumpur Statement" (1997) that affirms traditional Christian sexual ethics] and not otherwise".</div></blockquote>

<p>To endorse that means we must be out of communion in a significant sense with a number of English bishops. For some of us that will mean we need, immediately, alternative episcopal oversight.<br><br>Secondly, we need to act financially. Resolution 5 of the First Promise Statement reads something like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>We believe that the teaching of our church requires that our financial stewardship and giving must be "for the spread of the kingdom of God". We will therefore support and urge our people to support only those agencies and ministries which directly further the Great Commission. We will not fund, nor recommend funding, any institution, organization or person whose actions aid or further teaching contrary to the above principles [the Kuala Lumpur Statement and another statement like our Reform Covenant].</div></blockquote>

<p>That is what quota capping is all about for those who are net-givers.<br><br>But once you do that the heat will be on. Sadly money, as Martin Luther found, is the thing that really talks in a decadent church. Was Rome worried by justification by faith? No! Was Rome worried by the drying up of income for St Peter's from Luther's attack on indulgences? Most certainly.<br><br>And because of that "heat" Resolution 8 of the First Promise Statement says:</p>

<blockquote><div>We ... pledge to come to the aid of any brother or sister in Christ who is being persecuted for the sake of the gospel, as it has been received by this church, declaring that to attack them is to attack us all.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Evangelism</b><br><br>Thirdly, we must act for the gospel.<br><br>What does that mean? We need to love people and preach the gospel? We need a new concern for the lost and a new confidence in God's word.<br><br>Let me refer to Luther again. On one occasion he said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>The word of God is seldom retained in its purity in any one place beyond the period of twenty or at best forty years. The people become accustomed to it, grow cold in their Christian love and regard God's gift of grace with indifference.</div></blockquote>

<p>And isn't that what we need today for ourselves - to recover the word of God in its purity.<br><br>And as the word of God is recovered in all its purity, much will fall into place if we love people.<br><br>We will structure for growth. Our concern will not be to keep clergy happy or to have job security or good prospects for ourselves. Our concern will be saving souls from hell.<br><br>We will plant new churches, where necessary - come what may. <br><br>And as we recover confidence in the gospel we will have a burning desire to preach it and share it with others. And so we will follow Resolution 6 of theFirst Promise Statement of the American Evangelicals:<br><br>We will not be bound, in the exercise of our presbyteral or diaconal ministries, by the legal or geographical boundaries of any parish or diocese, if those boundaries are being invoked to prevent the preaching and teaching of "the doctrine, discipline, and worship of Christ as this Church has received them" [that is quote from the American Ordinal].<br><br><br><b>Schism and discipline</b><br><br>Fourthly, we must act to clear our minds about schism.<br><br>The fundamental issue today is over "what is the Church of England?" The "contention" is over the definition of the Church as it manifests itself in our denomination.<br><br>The presenting problem comes from people, including bishops, who deny key elements of the gospel. Such denial occurred in New Testament times. 1 John 2.19 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.</div></blockquote>

<p>John doesn't mince words. He has just called these people "antichrists".<br><br>What was different then, was this: these people in the New Testament had the moral integrity to leave and "go".<br><br>But the bishops and clergy that deny the virginal conception of Jesus and his empty tomb and validate gay sex want to stay. They then become like cuckoos in a nest where they do not belong. They want to define themselves as "the church" and "within the church". The consequence of that is that we appear as "divisive" and "a church within a church". And that phrase, "a church within a church", is persuasive, but only if you extend the boundaries as these bishops and clergy do.<br><br>We must not allow them to do that. We must say: "No! They are the 'dividers' because they haven't got the honesty to leave. And we, of the Western Reformed Catholic tradition, are 'the church' - full stop."<br><br>To divide from heretics is not schism but discipline. You must never have schism in the true body of Christ. But you must have "schism" from what is false - that is discipline. The false must be "cut" out. Of course, there must be care. Of course, God alone is the judge. But there is no danger, I can assure you, of any of us acting prematurely. The question is, will we act at all?<br><br>If we don't, there may be very little left of significance in the Church of England shell in 2020.<br><br>If we do, God alone will determine the shape of the Church then, but Christ will be glorified, men and women will be saved, and we will have been faithful.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Finally, we must pray. What should we pray for? We could do worse than echo Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1 and pray for one another in these terms - verses 17-19:</p>

<blockquote><div>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in th e saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe.</div></blockquote>

                <p><i>During September 1997 Tony Blair, it was reported, took issue with the Church Authorities over the appointment of a new bishop of Liverpool. The first bishop of Liverpool was J.C.Ryle at the end of the last century. Pray that the next bishop is a man with Ryle's biblical theology and not least his views on "the Church". Here they are. The language is sternly Victorian, but the substance is as vital and important now as it was 100 years ago. DRJH</i><br><br><br>Where is the one true Church? What is this one true Church like? What are the marks by which this one true Church can be known? You may well ask such questions. The one true Church is composed of all believers in the Lord Jesus. It is made up of all God's elect - of all converted men and women - of all true Christians. In whoever we can discern the election of God the Father, the sprinkling of the blood of God the Son and the sanctifying work of God the Spirit, in that person we see a member of Christ's true Church.<br><br>It is a Church in which all the members have the same marks. They are all born again by the Spirit: they all must "turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus" and holiness of life and conversation. They all hate sin; and they all love Christ. They worship differently and after various fashions; some worship with a form of prayer and some with none; some worship kneeling and some standing; but they all worship with one heart. They are led by one Spirit; they all build upon one foundation; they all draw their religion from one single book - that is the bible. They are all joined to one great centre - that is Jesus Christ. They all, even now, can say with one heart, "Hallelujah"; and they can all respond with one heart and voice, "Amen and Amen."<br><br>It is a Church which is dependent upon no ministers upon earth however much it values those who preach the gospel to its members. The life of its members does not hang upon church-membership and baptism and the Lord's Supper - although they highly value these things when they are to be had. But it has only one great head - one shepherd, one chief bishop - and that is Jesus Christ. He alone, by his Spirit, admits the members of this Church, though ministers may show the door. Until he opens the door no man on earth can open it - neither bishops, nor presbyters, nor convocations, nor synods. Once let a man repent and believe the gospel and that moment he becomes a member of this Church. Like the penitent thief he may have no opportunity of being baptized; but he has that which is far better than any water-baptism - the baptism of the Spirit. He may not be able to receive the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper; but he eats Christ's body and drinks Christ's blood by faith every day he lives; and no minister on earth can prevent him. He may be excommunicated by ordained men and cut off from the outward ordinances of the professing church; but all the ordained men in the world cannot shut him out of the true Church.<br><br>It is a Church whose existence does not depend on forms, ceremonies, cathedrals, churches, chapels, pulpits, fonts, vestments, organs, endowments, money, kings, governments, magistrates, or any act of favour whatever from the hand of man. It has often lived on, and continued, when all these things have been taken from it: it has often been driven into the wilderness or into dens and caves of the earth, by those who ought to have been its friends. Its existence depends on nothing but the presence of Christ and his Spirit, and they being ever with it, the Church cannot die.<br><br>This is the Church to which the scriptural titles of present honour and privilege, and the promises of future glory, especially belong; this is the body of Christ; this is the bride; this is the lamb's wife; this is the flock of Christ; this is the household of faith and the family of God; this is God's building, God's foundation, and the temple of the Holy Spirit. This is the Church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven; this is the royal priesthood, the chosen people, the people belonging to God, God's possession, a dwelling in which God lives, the light of the world, the salt and the wheat of the earth; this is the "Holy Catholic Church" of the Apostles' Creed; this is the "One Catholic and Apostolic Church" of the Nicene Creed; this is that Church to which the Lord Jesus promises "the gates of Hades will not overcome it," and to which he says, "I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matt 16.18; 28.20).<br><br>This is the only Church which possesses true unity. Its members are entirely agreed on all the weightier matters of religion, for they are all taught by one Spirit. About God, and Christ, and the Spirit, and sin, and their own hearts, and faith, and repentance, and the necessity of holiness, and the value of the bible, and the importance of prayer, and the resurrection, and judgment to come - about all these points they are of one mind. Take three or four of them, strangers to one another, from the remotest corners of the earth; examine them separately on these points; you will find them all of one judgment.<br><br>This is the only Church which possesses true sanctity. Its members are all holy. They are not merely holy by profession, holy in name, and holy in the judgment of charity; they are all holy in act, and deed, and reality, and life, and truth. They are all more or less conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. No unholy man belongs to this Church.<br><br>This is the only Church which is truly catholic. It is not the Church of any one nation or people: its members are to be found in every part of the world where the gospel is received and believed. It is not confined within the limits of any one country, or pent up within the pale of any particular forms or outward government. In it there is no difference between Jew and Greek, black and white, episcopalian and presbyterian - but faith in Christ is all. Its members will be gathered from north and south and east and west in the last day, and will be of every name and tongue - but all one in Jesus Christ.<br><br>This is the only Church which is truly apostolic. It is built on the foundation laid by the apostles, and holds the doctrines which they preached. The two grand objects at which its members aim, are apostolic faith and apostolic practice; and they consider the man who talks of following the apostles without possessing these two things to be no better than a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.<br><br>This is the only Church which is certain to endure unto the end. Nothing can altogether overthrow and destroy it. Its members may be persecuted, oppressed, imprisoned, beaten, beheaded, burned; but the true Church is never altogether extinguished; it rises again from its afflictions; it lives on through fire and water. When crushed in one land it springs up in another. The Pharaohs, the Herods, the Neros, the Bloody Marys, have laboured in vain to put down this Church: they slay their thousands, and then pass away and go to their own place. The true Church outlives them all and sees them buried each in their turn. It is an anvil that has broken many a hammer in this world, and will break many a hammer still; it is a bush which is always burning and yet is not consumed.<br><br>This is the only Church of which no one member can perish. Once enrolled in the lists of this Church, sinners are safe for eternity; they are never cast away. The election of God the Father, the continual intercession of God the Son, the daily renewing and sanctifying power of God the Holy Spirit, surround and fence them in like a garden enclosed. Not one bone of Christ's mystical body shall ever be broken; not one lamb of Christ's flock shall ever be plucked out of his hand.<br><br>This is the Church which does the work of Christ upon earth. Its members are a little flock, and few in number, compared with the children of the world: one or two here, and two or three there - a few in this district and a few in that. But these are those who shake the universe; these are those who change the fortunes of kingdoms by their prayers; these are those who are the active workers for spreading the knowledge of religion that is pure and faultless; these are the lifeblood of a country, the shield, the defence, the stay, and the support of any nation to which they belong.<br><br>This is the Church which shall be truly glorious at the end. When all earthly glory is passed away then shall this Church be presented without spot before God the Father's throne. Thrones, principalities, and powers upon earth shall come to nothing; dignities and offices and endowments shall all pass away; but the Church of the first-born shall shine as the stars at the last, and be presented with joy before the Father's throne, in the day of Christ's appearing. When the Lord's jewels are made up, and the manifestation of the sons of God takes place, episcopacy and presbyterianism, and congregationalism will not be mentioned; one Church only will be named, and that is the Church of the elect.<br><br>This is the true Church to which a man must belong if he would be saved. Until you belong to this, you are nothing better than a lost soul. You may have the form, the husk, the skin, and the shell of religion, but you have not got the substance and the life. Yes: you may have countless outward privileges; you may enjoy great light and knowledge - but if you do not belong to the body of Christ, your light, and knowledge and privileges will not save your soul. Sadly, ignorance prevails on this point! Men fancy if they join this church or that church, and become communicants, and go through certain forms, that all must be right with their souls. It is an utter delusion; it is a gross mistake. All were not Israel who were called Israel, and all are not members of Christ's body who profess themselves Christians. Take note, you may be a staunch episcopalian, or presbyterian, or congregationalist, or baptist, or methodist, or Plymouth Brother - and yet not belong to the true Church. And if you do not, it will be better at the last if you had never been born.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="b) A Comment on the Bishops' Report Issues in Human Sexuality">(November 1997) b) A Comment on the Bishops' Report Issues in Human Sexuality</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>November 1997</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>That the English Bishops' statement Issues in Human Sexuality is inadequate is clear from the confusion it has caused. The bishop of Jarrow, in the North East of England, for example, uses it to justify the blessing of same-sex unions. His arguments are reasonable and can be found in the JESMOND STATEMENT. Then again, the Bishop-elect of Newcastle (also in the North East of England), from whom Jesmond Parish Church is distancing itself, says on the one hand that he sticks by the Bishops' report with regard to homosexual relationships; but on the other hand he interprets this report as accepting (and he has told the world so):</p>

<blockquote><div>that faithful, lifelong, committed and permanent relationships are permitted - certainly amongst the lay-members of the church, but that cannot be the position for the priests.</div></blockquote>

<p>However, there is more than confusion in the report. There is error - serious error. That, of course, is inevitable in a document that seeks to embrace bishops who approve of homosexual sex and bishops who do not. In such a situation a report has to be something of a "lowest common denominator" [for the mathematicians, "highest common factor"]. By definition, this validates as an option in the church the most liberal of positions.<br><br>That there is such error is not surprising. The bishop that was "driving" the report was the former bishop of Salisbury. In the report's Preface George Carey writes (p.vii):</p>

<blockquote><div>In formulating it [the report] we have been greatly helped by the work of a small group, chaired by the Bishop of Salisbury.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The former Bishop of Salisbury</b><br><br>But the former Bishop of Salisbury has subsequently gone on personal record with his own views quite explicitly in his recent book The Faith of a Christian (Darton Longman and Todd, London, 1996) p. 142:<br><br>The traditional Christian norm of sexual behaviour is clear and simple: full sexual relations are in place only within a heterosexual marriage which is in intention lifelong. This, the final judgment of Scripture, is still official teaching in the great majority of churches.<br><br>This ideal can be commended for wholly positive reasons ...<br><br>This ideal has admittedly never been fully achieved, even within the Church itself. Nevertheless its basic elements were once widely accepted as valid ethical goals. Today, however, western ex-Christian society no longer regards it as either practicable or desireable and many church members have succumbed to that ethos ...<br><br>To the detached observer the most obvious feature of Christian sexual teaching is that it is an ethic for heterosexuals. Given that the overwhelming majority of the human race is heterosexual, that is reasonable enough. But it means that this ethic can be fairly applied to homosexuals only be classifying them as deviant homosexuals; and that, in the light of increasing knowledge, is no longer reasonable ...<br><br>Many heterosexuals can testify that the physical expression of their love in a faithful partnership has helped them become better people. If my neighbour reports exactly the same experience through the physical expression of his or her different sexuality and I condemn that as evil, am I not in great danger myself of condemnation for hypocrisy? Will I not be much safer to be guided by Jesus' own advice: "You will know them by their fruits"?<br><br>However excellent the Christian heterosexual ethic, it loses credibility when it is misused to dictate the way of godliness to homosexuals in their different situation. The first requirement is for the Churches to learn from Christian homosexuals what the Spirit is saying to them about growth in Christlikeness. When the listening does begin, a common mind on basic principles may freely emerge and in God's time lead to an authentic Christian homosexual ethic, accepted as such by the Church.<br><br>When you read Issues in Human Sexuality you will hear the tones of John Baker, the former Bishop of Salisbury. He is a great intellect. But that doesn't not mean he is right! Indeed, he is clearly wrong. More recently Bishop Baker gave a lecture at St Martin's in the Field that was far more "pro-Gay".<br><br>It is vital that people are not mislead and deceived by this report. It certainly must not be allowed to be a "set text" for the bishops of the world-wide Anglican Communion for Lambeth 1998.<br><br>The following is an extract from a lecture entitled The Case for Reform that I was asked to give in the University of Durham and subsequently published in the book, Has Keele Failed? (Hodder, London, 1995) pp. 52ff. Some may find this helpful. The sub heading was ...<br><br><br><b>"Issues in Human Sexuality"</b><br><br>Page 52 and following continued ...<br><br>Sadly, the church is not only adrift in terms of doctrine. It is also morally adrift. The House of Bishops collegially (for so they now work) must bear much of the blame and, not least, in the matter of homosexual behaviour. <br><br>There was a significant occasion, a little later than the debate over the Nature of Christian Belief, that revealed the drift (and weakness) of the late 20th century episcopate in the Church of England.<br><br>On 11 November 1987 in the General Synod I moved a modest amendment for some sort of church discipline in the context of a debate on homosexual relations. This would only affect the clergy; nor was it unfairly isolating homosexual behaviour; it was merely asking for "appropriate discipline" - appropriateness being left to the pastoral discretion of the bishop concerned. It said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>if a bishop, priest or deacon is to be a "wholesome example and pattern to the flock of Christ" (Canon C 4) appropriate discipline among the clergy should be exercised in cases of sexual immorality.</div></blockquote>

<p>It failed. This was because of the voting of the House of Clergy and the House of Bishops, with the bishops being most opposed to it. They rejected it by 14 votes to 5. The laity, however, supported this amendment by 136 to 84. The press then, not unreasonably, attacked the Bishops for moral cowardice.<br><br>So with this track record it was not surprising that in 1991 the bishops took tentative steps and virtually validated gay sex for lay people. This was in their report Issues in Human Sexuality. Parts of the report are quite good. But when they came to the key issue of homosexuality this is what they said:<br><br>it is ... only right that there should be an open and welcoming place in the Christian community both for those homophiles who follow the way of abstinence, giving themselves to friendship for many rather than to intimacy with one, and also for those who are conscientiously convinced that a faithful, sexually active relationship with one person, aimed at helping both partners to grow in discipleship, is the way of life God wills for them (italics mine).<br><br>The bishops have excluded, at present, clergy from this openness to 'gay sex'.<br><br>Evangelical bishops who, no doubt, were at Keele have agreed to this report as a corporate document. There was not a single word of dissent. The new Bishop of Durham, who claims personally to have repented of former criminal homosexual activity, has agreed to this report and today appeals to it. But what sort of repentance is that?<br><br><br><b>Conscience</b><br><br>In the report the bishops refer to the traditional teaching on the "conscience":</p>

<blockquote><div>Christian tradition ... contains an emphasis on respect for free conscientious judgement where the individual has seriously weighed the issues involved.</div></blockquote>

<p>Their argument for accepting (lay) homosexual-sex hinges round their commitment to the "conscience". The teaching on conscience is mediaeval. Personally I would want to question much of it as being not necessarily true or helpful. But what the bishops are doing is this: they are employing the general conclusion of this traditional teaching (respect for conscience); however, they are ignoring the detailed qualifications that must go along with that conclusion.<br><br>The bishops should have spelt out some of the essentials of this traditional teaching. These include the following. First, the paradigm case involving conscience is the duty to obey God rather than man as in Acts 5.29. Secondly, there must be a distinction made between a good conscience and one that is in error. And, thirdly, there must be a further distinction made between "vincible" and "invincible" error - error that can, and cannot, be corrected. A conscience in "invincible" error might today be called "pathological" and so is more excusable. A conscience in "vincible" error is morally guilty because it could and should have seen the truth. A conscience of a rational person that contradicts the clear teaching of the bible is always in "vincible" error and so guilty.<br><br>Now the case the bishops have in mind, if it is ruthlessly spelt out (as it must be in moral argument), is of a "conscientious conviction" that permits a person to engage in habitual acts of buggery or other same-sex genital activity on the grounds that this is not promiscuous; it is "aimed at helping both partners to grow in discipleship"; and it "is the way of life God wills for them". And because this comes from their "conscience" they are to have a welcome place in the church and "we stand alongside them in the fellowship of the Church." But this case, of course, bears no relationship whatsoever to the paradigm; it certainly is not the result of a good conscience; and it most certainly is a case of "vincible" not "invincible" error, for it transgresses a clear biblical and church mandate. As the bishops themselves admit:</p>

<blockquote><div>there is ... in Scripture an evolving convergence ... Sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable.</div></blockquote>

<p>According to tradition such a "conscientious conviction" of a "vincible" error should not be encouraged or followed. It is worth noting that there is a futher distinction to be made within "vincible" error - between what such a conscience permits and what it forbids. As in the bishops' case, where a "vincibly" errant conscience is permissive, it most certainly must not be followed. However, the traditional argument was that where it forbids something, it should be followed (ie in abstinence) until the error was discovered. This was, so it was said, because conscience errs more often through being too liberal than through being too strict. (It is, of course, these progressive qualifications that throw this whole tradition into disrepute. Nevertheless the bishops are claiming the moral authority of this tradition: they need to know what they are claiming!)<br><br>Can I summarize? The bishops are seeming to validate gay sex. They do not do this through the clear teaching of the bible. They do it through an appeal to the conclusions of a mediaeval tradition that many of us now reject anyway. But I have tried to show that the bishops have not even been fair to this tradition, which if applied consistently can make some legitimate distinctions.<br><br><br><b>Drift</b><br><br>There has undoubtedly been a drift since Nottingham in 1977, if not since Keele in 1966. Nottingham was the Keele follow-up. A number of the evangelical bishops that are now validating conscientious gay sex among the laity in 1977 signed up to the Nottingham Statement. But that statement implied no validation for gay sex at all. It indeed wanted there to be a "welcoming place" for Christian homosexuals; but it was assumed this was only for those Christian homosexuals "who follow the way of abstinence" or try to. In those days evangelicals never dreamt it was necessary to say otherwise. So the resolution simply said:</p>

<blockquote><div>There should be a full welcoming place in the Christian fellowship for the Christian homosexual. Nevertheless, we believe homosexual intercourse to be contrary to God's law and not a true expression of human sexuality as he has given it.</div></blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of 1995 many evangelical bishops were present at a London conference convened to promote evangelical unity. Prior to the meeting the Council of REFORM had written to all the episcopal participants asking them to affirm "for the avoidance of doubt ... that those clergy and laity who are 'convinced that a faithful, sexually active relationship with one person (of the same sex), aimed at helping both partners to grow in discipleship, is the way of life God wills for them' are in grave error and are breaking God's law, whether they are conscientiously so convinced or not". This was, of course, the wording from the bishops' report. Not one made that affirmation.<br><br><br><b>Scribes and Pharisees</b><br><br>The chairman of the conference, [a bishop], conspicuously only affirmed what the bishops' report had already affirmed. He however used the language of Nottingham 1977 that homosexual intercourse is contrary to "God's law" rather than the report's "God-given moral order". But the problem is not a failure to assert God's law, ideal or moral order. The report is good on that. The problem comes from what the report then adds. This, as with the scribes and Pharisees, "nullifies" the law of God. The scribes and Pharisees affirmed the law but their casuistry allowed them to defy it (Matthew 15.6). The bishops posit a dialectic between God's law and human freedom. And they remind us, in a concluding hint, that it is quite possible for "love [to be] summoning the Church to rethink its existing perception of the truth." That is why such an affirmation as [the bishop] made, in the world of modern bishops, is compatible with saying that homosexual genital acts, while wrong from the perspective of the church, are right for a person who conscientiously thinks they are right.<br><br>This may shock some (sadly, I suspect, not all) of the evangelical bishops. But this is the logic of what they have together said and now refuse to distance themselves from. All this is no more than conventional moral relativism. At a popular level many ascribe to it in the wider world (and the church) today. There may be absolutes and ideals. But they are relative to individual circumstances. Behaviours and beliefs can only be said to be "right for me".<br><br>The bishops in their report tell us that there is an "historic tension in Christian ethical thinking between the God-given moral order and the freedom of the moral agent." But that tension, they imply, allows for the creation of new ideals. They say:</p>

<blockquote><div>The ideal of chastity holds good for all Christians; and homophiles who do not renounce all physical sex relations must nevertheless be guided by some form of that ideal appropriate to them.</div></blockquote>

<p>What is this if not a new ideal alongside and contradicting the old ideal?<br><br>Some bishops may delude themselves by saying that all they are proposing in the report is that when active homosexuals come into your church, you do not immediately eject them! But, of course, the text of the report says much more than that. Indeed if the bishops really meant only that, it would imply a proposal to eject all but a precisely defined class of homosexuals. You should therefore eject all promiscuous homosexuals who may visit your church and who do not have the hypocrisy to believe that their behaviour is the path of Christian discipleship. But, surely, these are people you ought to help towards salvation and wholeness. <br><br>The report is tragic evidence that the Church of England is morally adrift and in need of reform.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="a) The Archbishop of York's letter and David Holloway's reply">(November 1997) a) The Archbishop of York's letter and David Holloway's reply</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>November 1997</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>

We are surprised that a very serious issue for the whole of Christendom is being turned into a local quasi-pastoral problem. This, sadly, personalizes the issue in a way we do not wish. And we are disappointed at what we judge to be an approach that seems to avoid the substantial issue and seeks to see a fundamental conflict as simply a matter of poor communication to be solved by dialogue. Surely what is required is moral decision and biblical obedience.<br><br>The church, our nation, and, because of the world-wide Anglican communion, other nations are looking to people like yourself to give a clear lead in restoring elementary biblical norms. Already the Jesmond Statement has gone round the world via the internet. We have had a large response in terms of interest and support.<br><br>People with sympathies such as we have at Jesmond Parish Church are, of course, tolerant in the Church of England and the Anglican Communion of diverse factors with which they have profound disagreements. They tolerate this diversity because they do not believe, before God, that action is always required. But that does not mean that any and every diversity can be tolerated for ever or that action is never required.<br><br>There are, indeed, moments in the history of the Church when issues surface that cannot be tolerated: they threaten the very soul of the Church. They are "beyond toleration". Such was the case with the Arian crisis in the early centuries of the Church; such was the case at the time of the Reformation in the 16th century; such was the case with the deist crisis in the 18th century; and such now, at the end of the 20th century, is the case with the extreme liberalisms that erode fundamental Christology and deny fundamental sexual ethics. There are defining moments and defining issues. We now have such a defining moment and a defining issue. It is presenting itself in the form of homosexual practice - an apparently small problem. But in the same way as the denial of "the empty tomb" of Jesus can seem at first small in Christology but then is seen to be of much wider significance, so does the acceptance of homosexual practice seem at first a small problem for sexual ethics but in reality it is also of much wider significance. And its significance is for the world as well as the church.<br><br>The Bishop of Kingston now has to be the focus. By not admitting that his is a representative position that can be addressed more theoretically, you are forcing us to personalize. We are very sorry. We understand that any individual involved in a dispute must feel hurt. But this is not of our choosing. And I need to add that that is a two way process and the distress felt at Jesmond Parish Church, and by millions like us around the world, seldom seems to be considered.<br><br>Of course, I am willing to accept that the Bishop of Kingston may never have meant to say at his press conference in front of journalists what he actually did say, namely that "homosexuality within a loving permanent relationship is no sin." However, the question is not, what did he mean to say, but what did he actually say, and what does he actually believe? Did it reflect, in an unguarded moment, his real thinking?<br><br>What are we to make of a parish in Bishop Wharton's own diocese of Southwark (and known to members of Jesmond Parish Church) which in your words has "explored personally and more fully" the issues and then reports to us as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>after a reasoned and gracious discussion the bishop, if put to it, couldn't find it in his heart to say that a loving, stable same sex relationship was sinful.</div></blockquote>

<p>And what are we to make here on Tyneside of the following words of the Rev Richard Kirker, the secretary of the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement, (whose 20th anniversary celebrations were held in Southwark Cathedral last October, with Bishop Wharton in attendance) - words reported in The Journal newspaper (4 November 1997):</p>

<blockquote><div>Bishop Wharton publicly upholds the official church position condemning homosexuality, but it is well-know that he doesn't uphold it privately.</div></blockquote>

<p>There is an on going pattern. Last year I took part in an Everyman BBC TV programme following this Southwark Cathedral celebration. One of the other participants in the programme was a clergyman who publicly admitted, in front of the cameras, to being an active homosexual. And he said this: "all my bishops including the present bishops - both diocesan and area bishop - have been totally supportive." He then went on to say, "it leaves open the curious question of what they are doing in relation to Issues in Human Sexuality and the line that the bishops are supposed to be taking, because they are breaking this line." His area bishop was (and is) Bishop Wharton.*<br><br>We also noticed in the Church of England Newspaper (3 October 1997):</p>

<blockquote><div>Rev Dr Jeffrey John ... has recently been made Canon Theologian of Southwark Cathedral and is one of the few openly gay priests in the Church of England.</div></blockquote>

<p>And Dr John's advocacy of "Christian Same-Sex Partnerships" forms one of the chapters in a new book, The Way Forward (Hodder, London, 1997). But there was no protest reported from Bishop Wharton at this appointment.<br><br>It should therefore be obvious to you that in this context for me to have sought to "clarify" the new bishop's views, or in the future to seek to do so, would be quite improper. It is not my duty to hold a virtual consistory court! Under Canon C 17.2 it, surely, is your duty to "make good the defects of other bishops"<br><br>To approach Bishop Wharton I personally would have had to do considerable research in the Southwark diocese before discussion. At least I would have had to find out who is correct - the clergyman recorded on Everyman, or Bishop Wharton. You must admit, there is a prima facie problem. The bishop-elect was reported in the Evening Chronicle as saying after his remark that "homosexuality within a loving, permanent relationship is no sin" the following: "but I think it would be inappropriate within the priesthood."<br><br>Perhaps you will now appreciate why, in the debate over homosexual issues, I can no longer automatically trust what bishops say. Many of them have indeed "weasel words", or, in the words of my good friend, the late Garry Bennett in respect of a member of the current House of Bishops' committee on Homosexuality, "honied vacuity". Worse there are lies. On BBC national TV, the morning of the General Synod debate on homosexuality last July (1997), a pro-homosexual bishop with whom I was being interviewed appeared to be lying - outright. I was arguing against lowering the age of consent to 16 with its slippery slope. I said the bishop was already advocating 14. He denied it. "I want," he insisted, "to correct something David Holloway has said. I have not said that I want to lower the age of consent to 14. I want that to be made quite clear."<br><br>However, I have a copy of his letter in the Gay Times from the previous summer, where a year before he had written this:</p>

<blockquote><div>ideally starting with the age of puberty we don't need an age of consent for gay sex though I think 14 would be reasonable.</div></blockquote>

<p>The point surely is clear. I could give example after example to show that unless I had researched and acquired a full picture of his Southwark episcopal area, I would never be confident that I had got to the truth with Bishop Wharton. This is a sad observation; but I must be frank.<br><br>Were I to approach him after making enquiries in this way, you and others would be the first to accuse me of conducting a witch-hunt. Also you would accuse me of impertinence and arrogance. I think there would be good reason. It is not for me to summon evidence and interrogate a bishop-elect and then take judicial action. This is exactly how it would have been interpreted if, after discussion, we, at Jesmond Parish Church, had taken the action we are taking.<br><br>An immediate solution, of course, is possible. The Bishop simply has to sign up to the Reform propositions and the Kuala Lumpur Statement as an expression of orthodox Christian sexual ethics. The reason, of course, why he needs to sign up to those propositions is so that I can report it on Tyneside (through the media). This now is the only way that the public damage Bishop Wharton has caused can be redressed.<br><br>But Bishop Wharton knows all this. That is why there was and is no need for discussion. He was written to, and given a copy of the Jesmond Statement, before it was published. He read in the Jesmond Statement that:</p>

<blockquote><div>We, of course, would welcome any bishop who having publicly expressed heterodox views on sexuality (such as the bishop-elect of Newcastle and the bishop of Jarrow) then publicly admitted the error and also affirmed the Reform subscriptions. Such action would indicate orthodoxy and a sympathy for the Kuala Lumpur Statement and thus a return to the biblical and legal position of the Church of England. We cannot ignore the legal position of the Church of England.</div></blockquote>

<p>Had there been some huge misunderstanding, the bishop could immediately have contacted us and said that we had got it all wrong; that he did not mean what he said at the press conference; that he did not mean what he said to the PCC in Southwark; that Richard Kirker's comment was wrong; that his going to the Southwark celebration meant nothing; that the clergyman on Everyman was wrong about his bishops; and the fact that this clergyman is still working in his episcopal area was an aberration. He could then have agreed to the Reform propositions and for that agreement to be publicised in the North East through The Journal and Evening Chronicle newspapers together with the local TV.<br><br>Had the bishop done that, the Jesmond Statement would not have been published - or in a very different form. The bishop-elect, however, decided not to do that. Nor were we expecting him to do so.<br><br>Instead, he issued a statement saying that he took the ambiguous report Issues in Human Sexuality "as guidance and ... its position as the best pastoral approach while the debate continues."<br><br>We accept that that is the position of Bishop Wharton. This allows him to say that stable homosexual relationships are not sinful. This can be said blatantly, as in his statement reported in the Evening Chronicle; or it can be said more subtly, as with the Archdeacon of Northumberland, who seems to be defending Bishop Wharton in his absence. On homosexual sex the Archdeacon's views, as expressed on BBC Radio Newcastle, last Thursday night, were as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>There may be some doubt that the traditional moral teaching of the church is applicable in every single situation. I would want to stick by it and say that it is the general rule. But I would also want to say that there may well be pastoral situations where for particular individual needs there has to be a somewhat more generous approach.</div></blockquote>

<p>We, at Jesmond Parish Church, understand that, but think it is wrong. It seems so minimal; but in fact it opens the flood gates. It is the crossing of that fundamental line. We have explained that in the Jesmond Statement. That is why we are still asking for alternative episcopal oversight. <br><br>The issue is much bigger than Jesmond Parish Church - can I implore you to see this.<br><br>Yes, we are drawing a line. Yes, we are saying that "enough is enough". No, we are not precipitate or unthinking. Can I say that on our PCC are several doctors, university professors, lawyers, business people, educationalists, others from the caring professions, as well as lay church staff with wide experience; and many of us are parents, deeply concerned for the future of our children and grandchildren in a world of collapsing standards and decadence even in the church.<br><br>Furthermore, we are convinced that there are many other important issues we have to be dealing with as Christians at the end of the 21st century. We have been discussing this question of homosexual relationships publicly since 1979. A conclusion has to be reached. We have concluded. Others may not like our conclusion. That is inevitable.<br><br>But our concern on Tyneside is to evangelise and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ; to help people show true love, both inside and outside the church; and to be, in so far as we can be, "salt" in a decaying society and "light" in a dark world. We are not willing to go on arguing in the church over the obvious. We need to be sharing our Christian insights with the world. So many outside the church are wanting a moral lead today. But this lead has to be rational, well thought through, well researched and coherent. To give that we cannot afford inordinate amounts of time on internal arguments over fundamentals. The Jesmond Statement was emphatic:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Church of England at large has been arguing since 1979, the year of its report Homosexual Relationships. We now see that arguing has helped to validate the assumption that sexual ethics are negotiable. It is used as a political ploy. We note that Jesus indicated it was possible for some to be always arguing and seeking proof but never be open to conviction. He called such people 'an evil and adulterous generation'.</div></blockquote>

<p>Our concern, however, is not limited to Tyneside. We have global concerns. We have a formal partnership with a parish in Africa. We cannot ignore Christians in Africa and their horror at the immorality they see in the Church of England. We also have had connections with the Province of South East Asia. We cannot ignore Christians there, either. As we have explained in the Jesmond Statement that Province has already taken action. We applaud them and support them in their faithfulness to the Bible. Then there are the pressing social problems of the Two-Thirds World we must be concerned with. It is not just that the Two-Thirds World is appalled at the doctrinal and moral laxity of the Western church. It is appalled that the West is so absorbed with sexual self-fulfilment and personal gratification.<br><br>It sees the philosophy that says "sexual drives have to be acted on" - a basic predicate of heterosexual immorality but especially of the homosexual life-style - as not only un-Christian but callous. It sees it as creating a culture of narcissism and self-gratification that ignores others. And those ignored include millions in the Two-Thirds World experiencing serious national debt; desperate poverty; and all the deprivations that follow such debt and such poverty in terms of basic food, shelter, clothing, health and education. That so called Christians in the affluent West cannot make sacrifices and exercise sexual restraint in line with the Bible, from a Two-Thirds world perspective is nothing other than obscene. We identify with those Two-Thirds World Christians. It is from this context that Christians have signed the Kuala Lumpur Statement.<br><br>True, in this issue we cannot all be winners. There will have to be exclusions and discipline. That, however, is not our fault nor our responsibility. You have the jurisdiction in the Province of York over bishops; you have the responsibility for exercising that discipline under Canon C 17.2.<br><br>I will not rehearse the arguments we put in the Jesmond Statement. We do believe there are "defects" in the bishop-elect. We believe you have a duty to address these issues which are of world-wide significance and must take appropriate action. These are not local pastoral matters to be resolved by better communication. As we have explained the conversation that is required is not a private conversation between myself and Bishop Wharton; rather it is a public conversation between Bishop Wharton and the media of Tyneside when he tells journalists that he subscribes to the Reform propositions and the Kuala Lumpur Statement. Otherwise action must be taken.<br><br>In Antioch when there was a public crisis in the church over table fellowship (Galatians 2), Paul did not have a private conversation with Peter. There was a public taking of issue by Paul "in front of them all". Yes, I would rather have objected, on behalf of Jesmond Parish Church, publicly at the original press conference with Bishop Wharton present. That, for obvious reasons, was not possible. Of course, where there is a private grievance, you go privately first and deal with your Christian brother or sister according to Matthew 18. But Bishop Wharton has not "sinned against me" in a personal way by his confusions and heterodoxy. Nor has he simply confused our church. Rather, in the most public way possible - through the modern media - he has confused the world. That is why it is, in our judgment, serious. This is a public issue. This is not, I must repeat, a local pastoral problem. The substantial issues cannot be avoided. The conflict cannot be resolved by better communication. We are indeed facing a "crisis" in the literal meaning of that term. It is a time for moral decision and biblical obedience.<br><br>We therefore appeal to you again under Canon C 17.2 for alternative episcopal oversight.<br><br>We noted that your letter to me was in the nature of an "open" letter, publicised through a press release. It would, therefore, seem right that this too should be an "open" letter.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br><br>David Holloway<br><br><br><br><br>* <i>The transcript from Everyman, 20 November 1996</i><br><br>Clergyman from Bishop Wharton's episcopal area of Southwark:</p>

<blockquote><div>I've served in this diocese for 17 years. I must have worked under six or seven different bishops, all of whom have known I am gay and for none of whom has it been a problem.All my bishops, including the present bishops - both diocesan and area bishop - have been totally supportive, and my sense is that they value my ministry very highly and that it is not a problem for them that I am gay.It leaves open the curious question of what they are doing in relation to Issues in Human Sexuality and the line that the bishops are supposed to be taking, because they are breaking this line.In part they break it because they don't actually ask me the ultimate question - am I sexually active. But I don't think it would make a difference, even if that were asked and if the response were "yes".</div></blockquote>

<p>Interviewer:</p>

<blockquote><div>Are you sexually active?</div></blockquote>

<p>Clergyman:</p>

<blockquote><div>Yes.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="d) Jesus - God Incarnate">(December 1997) d) Jesus - God Incarnate</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>This Christmas we will be singing again Charles Wesley's great carol Hark! the herald-angels sing. But why do we sing in the second verse the words:</p>

<blockquote><div>Late in time behold him come,Offspring of a virgin's womb.Veiled in flesh the Godhead see!Hail, the incarnate Deity!Pleased as Man with man to dwell,Jesus, our Emmanuel?</div></blockquote>

<p>That is an amazing statement that Jesus, the baby in Bethlehem, is God incarnate - God come in the flesh. He is "Emmanuel"; that means "God with us."<br><br>Many people find it difficult believing in the deity of Christ. But that is right at the heart of the Christian faith - that God himself came into the world as a man one, to show us what he is like; two, to show us what we, as men and women, should be like; and three, by his death, to save us from the mess we are in.<br><br>Gandhi once said (and millions like him have said): "I cannot ascribe exclusive divinity to Jesus. He is as divine as Krishna or Rama or Mohammed or Zoroaster." Jesus, they say, is just one among others. Some then try to say that the bible did not really teach that Jesus was God incarnate. That belief, together with the doctrine of the trinity, they say, came from the influence of Greek thinking on the early church. Such "orthodoxy", they conclude, is not biblical.<br><br>That is clearly wrong. The bible does teach the deity of Jesus. He was most certainly a man. But the bible teaches most certainly he was also "God come in the flesh" - God incarnate.<br><br><br><b>The Old Testament</b><br><br>Jehovah is the traditional translation of the Hebrew consonants YHWH - the special name for the one true God. The Jews said that this name was too sacred to be pronounced. So they replaced it by a variety of names - such as "Lord" or "the Name".<br><br>From Exodus 3.14 we know that YHWH was derived from the verb "to be":</p>

<blockquote><div>God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.</div></blockquote>

<p>But on a number of occasions Jesus refers to himself by using "I am". In John 8.58, for example, he says in controversy with the Jews:</p>

<blockquote><div>before Abraham was born, I am!</div></blockquote>

<p>Had he been saying he was merely a pre-existent being he would have said, "before Abraham was, I was." The Jews realised the implications of what Jesus was saying. "They picked up stones to stone him" for blasphemy (v 59).<br><br>At the time of his trial, Jesus was asked by the high priest about his messiahship. He replied, "I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Mark 14.62). The violent reaction from the high priest can only be explained if this was a claim to deity. He said, "you have heard the blasphemy" (v 64).<br><br>And there are many other roles or titles of Jehovah (Yahweh) from the Old Testament used of, and by, Jesus - author of eternal law, light, rock, bridegroom, shepherd, forgiver of sins, redeemer, saviour and judge.<br><br>In Isaiah 45.23 God says of himself (through the prophet):</p>

<blockquote><div>before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear.</div></blockquote>

<p>But in Philippians 2.10 Paul says:</p>

<blockquote><div>at the name of Jesus every knee should bow ... and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The Trinity</b><br><br>Jesus was indeed "making himself equal with God" as we read in John's Gospel (5.18). He was beginning to teach that the "unity" of God involved a true uniting of three "persons" in the Godhead or in the divine nature; and he was claiming to be one of them.<br><br>The New Testament never systematised the many statements of Jesus about his relationship to the Father. This happened years later in the early church. So the word "trinity" never appears in the New Testament. But the reality is there. In the last book of the bible, Revelation, there is a vision of the Lamb (Jesus) sitting on the one throne with God. It is "the throne of God and of the Lamb" (Rev 22.3). There was an essential oneness.<br><br>The "trinity" means "three in one" and "one in three" - "trinity in unity" and "unity in trinity". This is not "tri-theism" or "three Gods". Nor is it simply three aspects of God. Rather there are three "persons", where the word person applies to the distinctions within the one Godhead - "Father", "Son" and "Holy Spirit". Within the "oneness" there is communication, fellowship and identity.<br><br>The "trinity" is clear in the baptismal formula that the risen Jesus tells his disciples to use in Matt 28.19:<br><br>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>At the end of 2 Corinthians Paul pronounces a benediction in which the three persons of the trinity are named as partners with co-equal power to bless:</p>

<blockquote><div>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all (v 14).</div></blockquote>

<p>The "trinitarian" pattern is elsewhere in the New Testament. And in Romans 9.5 Paul is quite explicit about the deity of Christ:</p>

<blockquote><div>from them [the Jewish nation] is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, for ever praised! Amen.</div></blockquote>

<p>Then in Colossians 2.9 Paul writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.</div></blockquote>

<p>In Titus 2.13 he writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>we wait for the blessed hope - the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.</div></blockquote>

<p>The bible clearly teaches the deity of Jesus Christ. The doctrinal formulas of the early centuries were simply systematic reaffirmations of the bible in the face of similar denials as are made today. There is nothing new under the sun!<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>At the time of the Reformation in the 16th century Martin Luther said:</p>

<blockquote><div>he [Jesus] ate, drank, slept waked; was weary, sorrowful, rejoicing; he wept and he laughed; he knew hunger and thirst and sweat; he talked, he toiled, he prayed ... so that there was no difference between him and other men, save only this, that he was God and had no sin.</div></blockquote>

<p>Earlier this century Archbishop William Temple said:</p>

<blockquote><div>it is now recognised that the one Christ for whose existence there is any evidence at all is a miraculous Figure making stupendous claims.</div></blockquote>

<p>C.S.Lewis said:</p>

<blockquote><div>the discrepancy between the depth and sanity, and (let me add) shrewdness, of his moral teaching and the rampant megalomania which must lie behind his theological teaching unless he is indeed God, has never been satisfactorily got over.</div></blockquote>

<p>What is to be our conclusion this Christmas? Doubting Thomas at first could not believe in the resurrection of Jesus. Subsequently he had the evidence and met the risen Jesus. His conclusion, and the submission his conclusion required, were so clear: "My Lord and my God" (John 22.24-29). It was Paul who said:</p>

<blockquote><div>If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved (Rom 10.9).</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="e) The Virgin Birth">(December 1997) e) The Virgin Birth</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The issue</b><br><br>In the last Coloured Supplement I wrote about the incarnation and the fact that Jesus is "God Incarnate", God come "in the flesh". I started with Charles Wesley's lines from his famous carol Hark! the herald-angels sing:</p>

<blockquote><div>Late in time behold him come,Offspring of a virgin's womb.Veiled in flesh the Godhead see!Hail, the incarnate Deity!Pleased as Man with man to dwell,Jesus, our Emmanuel.</div></blockquote>

<p>But today there is not only confusion over the deity and incarnation of Jesus, "our Emmanuel" - which means "God with us". There is also confusion over his being "offspring of a virgin's womb". Sadly this confusion has been caused even by those within the church. Such people may have the best of intentions in trying to make the Christian faith easier for modern people. They say, "modern people can't believe in the virgin birth [or more correctly 'the virginal conception'] of Jesus." So they try to argue it away and say that Christians don't have to believe it either.<br><br><br><b>The biblical narratives</b><br><br>The question, however, is not what is easy to believe; rather it is the question of what is true. Is the bible correct or is the bible in error? The texts couldn't be clearer:</p>

<blockquote><div>This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit ... All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" - which means, "God with us."  (Matthew 1.18, 22-23)</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary ... the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favour with God. You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus ... "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?" The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God ... For nothing is impossible with God." (Luke 1.26-27, 30-31, 34-35, 37) </div></blockquote>

<p>But, how can thoughtful people affirm all this?<br><br>Some years ago I wrote an article in The Times (December 20 1986) in the heat of the controversy over the former bishop of Durham and his denials of the virginal conception. Here, repeated verbatim, are the arguments used then. I see no reason to change my views. I made the point that there are six key considerations we must never forget.<br><br><br><b>Mary, Joseph and the early period</b><br><br>First, the starting point is the Gospel narratives themselves. Matthew and Luke both have the same central core - namely that Mary remained bodily a Virgin in the conception of Jesus and did not have intercourse with Joseph. Yet both evangelists clearly were drawing on very different sources for their information. Few, therefore, would deny the following: "that a virginal conception through the power of the Holy Spirit is one of the few points on which they agree and that this tradition antedated both accounts (Raymond E. Brown - a [fairly liberal] New Testament scholar).<br><br>The story of the Virgin Birth goes right back to the earliest period. Indeed, the infancy narratives are clearly of Palestinian origin. They reflect Jewish fears of Herod the Great and Jewish piety centred on temple worship in Jerusalem. The traditional view is that the ultimate source of the narratives is the holy family - Joseph for Matthew and Mary for Luke. We must also remember that James, Jesus's brother, became head of the church at Jerusalem. He was, therefore, in a position to correct any Palestinian traditions where they were obviously untrue.<br><br>Second, the claim that "virgin births" are common in other religious literature has to be challenged. For religious literature mostly has accounts of "holy marriage". Here a "god" in human or superhuman form sexually impregnates a woman. But that is quite unlike the accounts of the virginal conception in the Gospels.<br><br><br><b>A midrash?</b><br><br>Third, the story of the Virgin Birth cannot simply be dismissed as a midrash - and for this reason. In Judaism a midrash was essentially a commentary on a passage of Old Testament scripture which then "took off". The midrashist had a text in front of him which he elaborated often in a most fanciful way. But the text was the starting point.<br><br>However, Matthew clearly is not starting with a text. He has a series of traditions about the birth and childhood of Jesus. Into these he weaves scriptural references. He is not adapting the narratives to fit [Old Testament] scripture. If anything he is adapting scripture to fit the narratives. The quotation in Matthew 2.23 ("he will be called a Nazarene") is a very drastic adaptation - it has no known reference! Matthew is not taking Old Testament texts and then writing myths to fit.<br><br>If he were doing that he would have chosen more evocative sections of the Old Testament. And, from contemporary Jewish practice we know that basic events were never concocted out of texts. The Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran show how texts are made to fit contemporary events and not vice-versa. There always was a substratum of fact. Even the critic must admit that Matthew started with the basic outline of the infancy narrative.<br><br><br><b>The facts</b><br><br>Fourth, uke himself tells us that he was interested in the truth - "it seemed good to me ... to write an orderly account ... that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught" (Luke 1.3-4). Even if contemporary Jews had a more cavalier approach to history writing, there is every reason for thinking that the early Christians had a very different attitude to history.<br><br>That was because other Jews located the saving events of God in the distant past; or, if they were of an apocalyptic turn of mind, in the future; but the early Christians said they were located in the recent past. Hence we must presuppose they had an interest in what actually happened.<br><br>Fifth, the Old Testament said the Messiah would be born of David's line. The New Testament makes it clear that Jesus was believed to be the Messiah. Why then invent an untrue story that separates Joseph (of David's line) from the process of conception?<br><br>Sixth, if Mary had not been a virgin, no one would have created a myth to suggest she was a great example of obedience. The strict moral climate of the day would have classed her fornication as highly disobedient.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Those are some of the considerations that give us confidence in the New Testament and in the teaching of Christians down the centuries as it is summarised in the Creeds. As we say so regularly, "He [Jesus] was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary." The virginal conception was a supernatural miracle. It confirmed the fact that Jesus is indeed God incarnate - fully man, but without sin.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="c) The Ordination of Women">(December 1997) c) The Ordination of Women</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li><li>Sex</li><li>sexuality</li><li>gender</li><li>Men</li><li>Women</li><li>equality</li><li>Church of England</li><li>role</li><li>truth</li><li>culture</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Let me give you my position before we start and before I go into some of the theological issues. You will, then, know where I'm coming from. I have four basic convictions.<br><br>First, we are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue. Emotions run high on both sides. I believe it is essential we de-escalate the rhetoric and lower the emotional temperature.<br><br>Secondly, we tend to argue against extreme positions on either side, rather than against the best positions on either side and then listen to what is being said.<br><br>Thirdly, polarisation has meant that too often we have not really discussed the issues. We've had 'politics' rather than theology. I am not sure that that is the best way to solve the problems related to this sort of dilemma.<br><br>Fourthly, we then have a confusion of issues. We mix questions of ordination itself, ministry, priesthood, gifts, leadership, the doctrine of the Church, sacramental theology, sexuality, sexual role and the function of institutionalized offices. Many of us do not want to give one blanket answer that implies there is no complexity of issues. The key issue, of course, is that of biblical interpretation and deciding what in the bible is cultural and what is trans-cultural?<br><br>With the background of those four convictions I see the various campaigns as leading us on a collision course. So that is why I'm cautious in this whole business.<br><br>I also have to say that I am only 70 per cent convinced of my own position. For me there are still problems; some things are 'grey'. But it's no good pointing up the 30 per cent of weaknesses in my position. I cannot with integrity change my position until I am convinced 71 per cent of the other side's point of view. But today in many areas we adopt an irresponsible ethics of 'exceptions': people build on 'the 30 per cent of anomalies' in all sorts of areas, both in the world and in the church, to overturn what is 70 per cent certain.<br><br>Finally, by way of introduction can I say two other things?<br><br>First, my wife is a doctor. I have not only a son, but two (lively) daughters - one is at the university, the other is hoping to go to a university.<br><br>At Jesmond Parish Church we often have nearly 800 different people with us on a Sunday and they are ministered to by a full-time staff, mostly lay, but with a number of women among them -very able women. One, for example, has been a probation officer, a social worker and also has a degree in theology - she is now in charge of our pastoral work; another was in charge of RE in a State school and is now in charge of our youth work; and so on. We believe in women's ministry.<br><br>I honestly can say I am totally 'for women' - their education, their training and their fulfilment. But the senior ministry, comprising the 'presbyters' (or, in the shortened form, the 'priests') at Jesmond Parish Church, is male.<br><br>Secondly, I want to say this. I believe that our culture has moved, at large, from a 'truth' orientation to a 'needs' orientation. For many people today 'truth' is unimportant. Certainly it is not absolute. What matters, they say, is what helps them or what makes them feel comfortable; and what meets their perceived needs.<br><br>Personally I am opposed to this cultural drift. Once you lose a grip on 'truth' you are soon awash in a sea of irrationality and that can be very dangerous. But if you start from the 'truth' side of the equation - as I do - you are, today, on an uphill battle. Many people think you are odd. The fashion is to give greater weight to 'needs'. So you seem to be 'hard-hearted' for stressing 'truth'. But remember the Bible says, 'the truth will make you free.'<br><br>Also, I come to this issue as an Evangelical. I take the Bible seriously. Of course, I realise that the Bible is a book that reflects various cultures. So I am concerned to see what is cultural and what is supra or trans-cultural in it. I agree, we must question the text.<br><br>But - and this is the big 'but' - we must let the text question us as well, with all our cultural bondage and with all our prejudices in favour of innovation and against tradition.<br><br><br><b>The Old Testament</b><br><br>Let me start with the Old Testament. The basics are generally clear.<br><br>Genesis 1.27 affirms human sexuality and the equality of the sexes:</p>

<blockquote><div>so God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.</div></blockquote>

<p>In chapter 2 of Genesis the difference between the sexes is affirmed with the creation of Adam and Eve, with Adam having the role of communicating God's word to Eve.<br><br>In chapter 3 of Genesis you have the 'Fall' when the loving and equal distinction of role is degraded into one of male 'domination':</p>

<blockquote><div>3.16 (Eve is being addressed) your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you. </div></blockquote>

<p>This is the Genesis narrative on sex and sexuality.<br><br>Two things need to be noted. First, the distinction between men and women is there before the Fall. There is no other fundamental distinction in human kind at the beginning of creation. That is why as someone has well said:</p>

<blockquote><div>to be human is to share humanity with the opposite sex.</div></blockquote>

<p>And secondly, following from that, because this is all part of the creation, it is implied that sexuality is the way things are. Fundamental sexual difference is a matter of creation, not of history.<br><br>The Greeks tried to say that sexuality was not part of the created order but subsequent to it. They had a myth of a sexless hominid who was first created and who was subsequently split in two.<br><br>Jumping the centuries, Marx and Engels argued that sexual difference, apart from minor plumbing differences, were all due to historical evolution and were not essential.<br><br>But the Biblical view, as seen here in these creation narratives, is that there are essential differences at a fundamental level between men and women. There is equality - total equality in the sight of God - but difference.<br><br>And so the Christian aim is to get us back from Genesis 3, where there is that wrong male domination, to Genesis 1, where there is equality and Genesis 2, where there is difference.<br><br>You say, what about the rest of the Bible? Well, let's move on.<br><br>In the book of Judges you come across Deborah. She was a remarkable woman. But she was a 'charismatic' figure. The Holy Spirit came upon her and she acted, as she was inspired, for the Lord. She was not an institutional figure.<br><br>That is very important. For later in the Old Testament we meet other 'charismatic' figures - prophetesses, like Huldah. But there are no priestesses in the Old Testament.<br><br>I find this remarkable.<br><br>There were plenty of priestesses in the Ancient Near East, among Israel's neighbours. In Canaanite religion you had priestesses and cult prostitutes. But Canaanite religion was what the Old Testament prophets were so against.<br><br>There seemed to be a resistence to institutionalizing women for religious leadership. Yes, if the Holy Spirit came upon them - and it was the Holy Spirit, not some demonic agency -they must function as they were inspired. But no, they were not 'ordained' or institutionalized.<br><br>So much for the Old Testament.<br><br>What about the New Testament?<br><br><br><b>The New Testament - Jesus</b><br><br>We start of course with Jesus.<br><br>Now, remember, Jesus was supremely unconditioned by his culture. Judaism (though not all of it) did repress women. But Jesus broke through this tradition. He taught women.<br><br>You remember the 'Woman at the Well' in John 4? Jesus had women in his band of disciples. He was the great women's liberator. Nor was he bound by tradition if it obscured his Father's will. What he was concerned to do was to go back to basics. So in Mark 10.6 he says:</p>

<blockquote><div>from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.</div></blockquote>

<p>Jesus affirms sexuality; he treats both sexes as equal, but he sees the differences.<br><br>It is against this background that you have to note his choosing 12 male Apostles.<br><br>I personally find this difficult; but it is a fact.<br><br>Christ's mission was so important; he needed as many committed people who wanted to serve him as possible. So why not put into that number one of the Mary's? They were perfectly capable of travelling around the country with him - they did. But he didn't include them in the 12. And I can't ignore that fact.<br><br>Then there was the Last Supper. It seems to have been a Passover meal. Normally you would have had women and children participating. But there were no women at the Last Supper, just the 12 male apostles.<br><br><br><b>The New Testament - St Paul</b><br><br>Many people say the trouble started with Paul; and they go on to say, 'Oh! Don't bother with him; he was just echoing his culture.'<br><br>The trouble with that argument is this: Paul was the great opponent of Jewish culture. That's what led to his trial at Rome - for saying that the Gentiles needn't be circumcised to be accepted by God; for faith in Jesus Christ was the key to justification. But circumcision was the mark of Jewish culture.<br><br>There is a lot of mythology about the culture of Paul's day - the culture of the Ancient Greco-Roman world.<br><br>The Greeks in the classical age treated women in various ways. In Athens they were repressive; in Sparta they were less so. The Romans in their classical age were by no means always repressive. Indeed, by the end of the first century AD there was a 'women's liberation' movement in the Roman world.<br><br>Juvenal, the Latin satirical poet, in his 6th satire gives us a series of portraits of the 'modern woman'. She has abandoned her traditional duties and pleasures in an attempt to compete with men, not only in literature and law, and in giving advice to the generals of the legions, but also in joining men in hunting, learning swordplay for the arena, and swaggering about in men's clothes. 'I am a human being after all (homo sum)' was the cry. They tried not only to out-think, but also, according to Juvenal, to out-drink and out-eat the men!<br><br>It was to churches in that kind of world, and in urban centres where culture changes fastest, that Paul was writing his epistles.<br><br>So what does Paul actually say?<br><br>He affirms sexuality in 1 Corinthians 7. He teaches full sexual equality in Gal 3.28:</p>

<blockquote><div>There is neither Jew nor Greek, ther is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</div></blockquote>

<p>But he sees the distinctions.<br><br>And Paul, Timothy and Titus set up 'elders' (presbuteroi/priests) and 'overseers' (episcopoi/bishops).<br><br>But these were all male. The key qualification for their appointment was faithfulness to the word of the Gospel. They were to be leaders of the community and they were to lead by the word. And these were, of course, communities known for sharing in a common eucharistic mean (holy communion).<br><br>There were no hang ups, however. Women functioned effectively in this structure. There was Lydia (a distinguished business women), Priscilla and others. Women prayed and prophesied. But, writes Paul,</p>

<blockquote><div>I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. (1 Cor 11.3) </div></blockquote>

<p>Now, I know of the attempts to make these and other similar texts say something other than they seem to be saying. But I do not find these attempts convincing. For the hierarchy of relationships here is based on the inner life of the divine Trinity. It has nothing to do with culture. Our triune God is the creator of, not the product of, human culture.<br><br>And note that while there is 'subordination' here, there is no domination. The Father does not 'dominate' the Son. And, of course, the Son is equal to the Father. It was on this that the early Church was so adamant in the Arian controversy. And these hierachies are not those of privilege, but of responsiblity. And this underlies the Genesis narrative as it relates to the sexes.<br><br>The result? It seems to me that the New Testament teaches that the richness of human life comes through a co-operative relationship with the opposite sex while maintaining sexual difference and equality.<br><br><br><b>Hard</b><br><br>But we find this hard. Why?<br><br>There have been two pressures.<br><br>First, there have been gross injustices towards women and a degradation of women down the centuries in some cultures.<br><br>Here's Plato - 'a bad man's fate was to be reincarnated as a woman.'<br><br>Here's Aristotle - 'females are imperfect males accidently produced by their fathers' inadequacy.'<br><br>And the Pharisees prayed and thanked God that they 'were not born a Gentile, a slave or a woman.'<br><br>It is as bad in Hinduism, or worse - Ghandi wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>A Hindu regards himself as Lord and master of his wife, who must ever dance attendance on him.</div></blockquote>

<p>In Islam the Koran says that Allah made men superior to women.<br><br>All this comes from the male domination following the Fall. It accepts the distinctions between the sexes but denies the equality that the bible teaches in Genesis and that Jesus underlined. It is clearly sinful. And one has every sympathy with the feminist movement for rejecting it.<br><br>But then there is the other extreme. While accepting the equality, this extreme denies the distinctions. This is the feminist movement's mistake.<br><br>A 'father' of modern feminism was Engels. He said that the way to change society was to change the family. And the way to change the family was to change the role of the mother. He says the family and its role structures simply reflect the oppression of the proletariat by the capitalist class. Let me quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>modern society is grounded on a blatant or concealed domestic enslavement of women, and modern society is a material mass consisting of molecules of numerous individual families. The husband is the bourgeois of the family, and the wife represents the proletariat.</div></blockquote>

<p>And that has led to the extremes of someone like Shulamith Firestone. In The Dialectic of Sex she demands the elimination of even genital sexual characteristics, because she sees that among animals a certain subordination of the female results from sex differences. She is hopeful of modern biology as the way to utopia. She wrote rather prophetically in 1970:</p>

<blockquote><div>choice of the sex of the foetus, test-tube fertilization ... are just round the corner.</div></blockquote>

<p>This is the trend towards 'androgyny'; it is also the 'homosexual' ideal.<br><br>One of the first women to be ordained to the priesthood in the US was Ms Ellen Marie Barrett. She was ordained by the Bishop of New York, Paul Moore, in 1977. Prior to her ordination she had been active in the Gay Movement and had served as an officer of 'Integrity', an Episcopalian homosexual group. At the time of her ordination she was an avowed and practising lesbian. She claimed that 'what feeds the strength and compassion I bring to the ministry' was her relationship with her lesbian partner.<br><br>The homosexual philosophy is that there are no fundamental distinctions between the sexes.<br><br>Of course, many support the Ordination of Women who are appalled by those in the Church who are pushing for an acceptance of homosexual behaviour. But some argue that it is a 'slippery slope'. One of the key women behind the recent vote in the [Gemeral] Synod [of the Church of England] was reported in the press as saying this was the first step. The next would be to ordain open homosexuals and then for the church to recognize Gay marriages.<br><br>It was Margaret Mead, the anthropologist, who argued that when the differences between the sexes are obscured, erotic needs get focused solely and exaggerately on genital sexuality. And. isn't that what we have today - a sex besotted culture? It has recently been revealed that the richest man in the UK is Paul Raymond - someone who has made his fortune out of pornography and the graphic or dramatic presentation of eroticism in general and (mostly female) genitalia in particular. But, as Manfred Hauke argues:</p>

<blockquote><div>at the same time the erotic instinct becomes less sure, and there is a veritable boom in homosexuality.</div></blockquote>

<p>Well, there we are. The issues are complex.<br><br>I am a 'conservative' in the sense of following Augustine. He said that where the Bible doesn't speak clearly we follow the tradition of the Church.<br><br>Now if you follow Church history, you will find that there have been attempts to ordain women and they have failed. The Gnostics in the early church ordained women. Epiphanius in the 4th century says that they justified this on the basis of Gal 3.28 ('in Christ are neither male nor female'). Epiphanius countered by quoting 1 Cor 14.34 and 1 Tim 2.12 and drawing attention to the fact that Paul referred to the order of creation in 1 Cor 11.8.<br><br>So this debate was going on in the 4th century (it is nothing new). But the Church that survived was made up of those Christians that agreed with Epiphanius rather than the Gnostics. Gnosticism - as with most heresies - died a death.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Yes, 'gifts' are to be used in ministry. And at the moment in some churches there are restrictions on gifted women that are unwarranted and should be lifted.<br><br>With regard to the world outside the Church I have few problems. I can accept a woman Prime Minister - after all Deborah in the Old Testament (already referred to) was the archetypal 'Iron Lady'. Nor do I have problems with women in secular professions - after all Lydia was a 'seller of purple'. But Paul who knew all about her and about the spiritual equality of the sexes still spoke about man as the 'head'. And this is higly embarassing to the 'spirit of the age'; but there it is in the text.<br><br>So what can I say in conclusion?<br><br>First, because of the teaching on equalIty, sexual segregation (apart from the requIrements of modesty and common sense) is generally inhuman; rather there should be mutual respect and openness - this is one of the great and good insights that has come through feminist pressure.<br><br>But, secondly, the essential man/woman relationship is intrinsically non-reversible. And this is where 'the rubber hits the road' as far as our own cultural bondage is concerned.<br><br>What does 'non-reversibilIty' mean in practice? Let me quote at this point Dr J.l.Packer:</p>

<blockquote><div>It means, other things being equal, a situation in which a femdle boss has a male secretary, or a marriage in which the woman (as we say) wears the trousers, will put mnore strain on the humanity of both parties than if it were the other way round.</div></blockquote>

<p>The creation narrative, and Paul's allusions to it, make it clear that this is all part of the created order - a given. Nothing will change it; certainly not redemption. Grace restores nature, it does not destroy It<br><br>So now we come to the critical questIon. And it is this? Will the ordination of women to the priesthood affect the relational dynamics between men and women. Will it be more than just a specific role reversal, merited by special circumstances or special people? Will it be a relational reversal?<br><br>As an Evangelical I have no problems with women celebrating the Holy Communion. But I do have a problem with a woman being the instituted president of the eucharistic ccmmunity. Of course, gifted women can lead. But with ordination of women to the priesthood, as a matter of social psychology and Anglican fact, I believe we will be institutiona1izing the possibility of relational reversal and not just role reversal. That is why Archbishop William Temple argued that if the need was for a celebrant, it would be right to authorize a deaconess (now deacon) to celebrate Holy Communion rather than ordain her a priest, with the inevitable consequence of her being spiritual 'head' in the eucharistic community.<br><br>C.S. Lewis, speaking of the ordination of women to the priesthood, referred to 'a sense of disquiet (experienced by women as well as men) which is hard to analyse.' I have tried to explain why there is this disquiet.<br><br>No, we must never impose restrictions on women's ministry that Scripture does not impose.<br><br>Yes, we must accept all the insights of the women's movement that show how blind so many in the church (and elsewhere), over the centuries, have been to women's gifts, roles and equality.<br><br>But let me finish with some word's of Clark Pinnock:</p>

<blockquote><div>If it should turn out to be true that God did intend males to exhibit strength in leadership roles and females to excel more as the guardians of society's emotional resources, why should this be viewed ipso facto as an evil arrangement?</div></blockquote>

<p>The key today is not to be passionate, but to be biblical. We must not listen to the repression of earlier centuries; nor to the reaction of the 20th century. We must listen to the Apostolic teaching of the Bible.<br><br>The Bible says God is to be conceived as 'he', yet the great example of human faithfulness was a 'she' - Mary the mother of Jesus. It is not that 'maleness' or 'femaleness' is better or worse. It is not that male or female roles are better or worse; or that certain church orders are better or worse. It is all a matter of our calling. And not every calling is open to either sex. Males cannot be called to be mothers. I've yet to be persuaded by the Bible, tradition or reason that females can be called to be heads of eucharistic communities - that is to say, presbyters or bishops. Some disagree; they even believe the ordination of women is the key to the Church's future. But surely hope for the future will only come as churches wait afresh on God for his Holy Spirit and as there is a return to the Gospel that Jesus Christ, crucified and risen, is the only Saviour and Lord.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="b) Hooker on Separation (Heresy, Schism and Apostasy)">(December 1997) b) Hooker on Separation (Heresy, Schism and Apostasy)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>The Church of England is facing a crisis.<br><br>It came to a head in the Autumn of 1997 over homosexual relations. The Bible is clear that such behaviour is sin and requires repentance. Even a House of Bishops' report, that liberal bishops endorsed, summarises the "convergence" of biblical teaching in these terms: "sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable."<br><br>Yet there are clergy and bishops who are celebrating homosexual love and believe it should be blessed (the Bishop of Jarrow, for example); while others (like the new Bishop of Newcastle) believe that "homosexuality within a loving, permanent relationship is permitted". It is true that such people believe it inappropriate within the clergy; but "the church line" is now generally perceived to be that homosexual relationships among the laity are acceptable.<br><br>What would Hooker, the great 16th century Anglican theologian, reformer and Christian "apologist", have said and done?<br><br>First, Hooker knew that, as Article XXVI says, "in the visible church the evil be ever mingled with the good [and the true and the false]."<br><br>But according to this (first) Sermon on part of Jude, who was "inwardly" genuine or "coupled and joined to Christ ... without any manner of simulation" and who was not, "none can tell save he whose eyes do behold the secret disposition of all men's hearts." We, therefore, should use a judgment of charity and so use "all men as brethren."<br><br>It is here that some have been mislead. Hooker was not suggesting that no judgments could ever be made. He knew that Article XXVI also says, "it appertainteth to the discipline of the church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused." It was only with regard to "the inward man", as he says in the sermon, that we "must leave the secret of every servant to his own Lord". It was there that a judgment of charity was needed.<br><br>This, however, was not without qualification. Such a judgment of charity, he tells us, was dependent on two things: one, a person's keeping "the profession of the gospel"; and two, their remaining "in the outward communion of saints."<br><br>Not all is "inward". There is "outward" profession and the reality of "outward" fellowship. So there can, indeed, be heresy or schism (and even apostasy) and that is so self-evident that judgments are self-made.<br><br>On the one hand, Hooker says, people can "loose the bond of faith". This they do when they "frowardly oppugn any principal point of Christian doctrine." What happens then is that they "separate themselves by heresy." And according to Hooker, "then it is no injury to term them as they are." They are separating themselves. They are not so much judged by us, as by their own doings. We simply describe what we see. There is no looking into the "inward man". What is then required is not so much judgment as sentence.<br><br>So for us today when a bishop defies Christian sexual ethics, he is "loosing the bond of faith". He is separating himself from the household of faith. That is the result, for example, of a bishop's public or "outward" views of support for homosexual sex, something the bible explicitly forbids.<br><br>Evidencing such "outward" views is not wrong or an "injury", according to Hooker. Rather it is to "term them as they are". Exposure is, therefore, necessary. And the conclusion now in the 20th or 21st centuries is, in principle, the same as it has been since Hooker's day. Clergy must respond to ensure that they "drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's Word" (BCP Ordering of Priests). And such episcopal "defects" must be corrected by archbishops and alternative oversight "supplied" (Canon C 17.2).<br><br>On the other hand, Hooker says, people can "break the bond of unity". Clearly being separate from heretical separation is not what Hooker has in mind. What he is referring to is when people "wilfully forsake all external communion with saints in holy exercises". It is isolationism or withdrawal from orthodox believers. That is "to separate themselves by schism."<br><br>Now it is possible to accuse people falsely both of heresy and of schism. Hooker himself was charged on both counts (and on a charge of apostasy as well) by those still loyal to Rome.<br><br>He denied the charge of heresy on the grounds that he believed "all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets" - that is the bible. The bible for him was the test of orthodoxy.<br><br>And he denied he was schismatic with that seminal sentence - a sentence that needs to be a motto for 20th and 21st century reform in the Church of England:</p>

<blockquote><div>That which they call schism, we know to be our reasonable service unto God." </div></blockquote>

<p>Hooker knew that there were certain times that action had to be taken.<br><br>So what is the application for today?<br><br>Surely, when morality sinks to an all time low, and bishops attend a celebration of homosexual sex in a so-called Christian Cathedral, it is time, along with Hooker to cry "shrill in our ears, 'Go out of Babylon, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues [be they AIDS or Hepatitis B or some other sexually transmitted disease]'."<br><br>Hooker, though dead, still speaks.<br><br><i>David Holloway</i><br><br><br><b>Jude vv 17-21</b></p>

<blockquote><div>17 But ye, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. 19 These are makers of sects, fleshly, having not the Spirit. 20 But ye, beloved, edify yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost. 21 And keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto eternal life.</div></blockquote>

<p>10. St Jude having his mind exercised in the doctrine of the apostles of Jesus Christ concerning things to come in the last time, became a man of wise and stayed judgment. Grieved he was to see the departure of many, and their falling away from the faith which before they did profess - grieved but not dismayed. With the simpler and weaker sort it was otherwise. Their countenance began by and by to change. They were half in doubt they had deceived themselves in giving credit to the gospel of Jesus Christ. St Jude, to comfort and refresh these silly lambs, taketh them up in his arms and sheweth them the men at whom they were offended:</p>

<blockquote><div>Look unto them that forsake this blessed profession wherein you stand. They are now before your eyes. View them. Mark them. Are they not carnal? Are they not like to noisome carrion cast out upon the earth? Is there that Spirit in them which crieth 'Abba, Father' in your bosoms? Why should any man be discomforted? Have you not heard that there should be 'mockers in the last time?' These verily are they that now do separate themselves.</div></blockquote>

<p>11. For your better understanding what this severing and separating of themselves doth mean, we must know that the multitude of them which truly believe (howsoever they be dispersed far and wide, each from other) is all one body, whereof the head is Christ; one building, whereof he is the corner-stone, in whom they, as the members of the body being knit and as the stones of the building being coupled, grow up to a man of perfect stature and rise to an holy temple in the Lord.<br><br>That which linketh Christ to us is his mere mercy and love towards us. That which tieth us to him is our faith in the promised salvation revealed in the word of truth. That which uniteth and joineth us amongst ourselves, in such sort that we are now as if we had but one heart and one soul, is our love. <br><br>[The answer to] who be inwardly in heart the lively members of this body and the polished stones of this building, coupled and joined to Christ, as flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones, by the mutual bond of his unspeakable love towards them and their unfeigned faith in him, thus linked and fastened each to other by a spiritual, sincere, and hearty affection of love, without any manner of simulation; [and] who be Jews within and what their names be, none can tell save he whose eyes do behold the secret disposition of all men's hearts.<br><br>We, whose eyes are too dim to behold the inward man, must leave the secret judgment of every servant to his own Lord, accounting and using all men as brethren both near and dear unto us, supposing Christ to love them tenderly, so [long] as they keep the profession of the gospel and join in the outward communion of saints. Whereof the one doth warrantize unto us their faith, the other their love, till they fall away and forsake either the one or the other or both. And then it is no injury to term them as they are. When they separate themselves, they are autokatakritoi, not judged by us, but by their own doings.<br><br>Men do separate themselves either by heresy, schism, or apostasy.<br><br>If they loose the bond of faith, which then they are justly supposed to do when they frowardly oppugn any principal point of Christian doctrine, this is to separate themselves by heresy.<br><br>If they break the bond of unity, whereby the body of the Church is coupled and knit in one, as they do which wilfully forsake all external communion with saints in holy exercises purely and orderly established in the Church, this is to separate themselves by schism.<br><br>If they willingly cast off and utterly forsake both profession of Christ and communion with Christians, taking their leave of all religion, this is to separate themselves by plain apostasy. And St Jude, to express the manner of their departure which by apostasy fell away from the faith of Christ, saith, "they separated themselves," noting thereby that it was not constraint of others which forced them to depart. It was not infirmity and weakness in themselves. It was not fear of persecution to come upon them, whereat their hearts did fail. It was not grief of torments, whereof they had tasted and were not able any longer to endure them. No, they voluntarily did separate themselves with a fully settled and altogether determined purpose never to name the Lord Jesus any more, nor to have any fellowship with his saints, but to bend all their counsel and all their strength to raze out their memorial from amongst them.<br><br>12. Now because that, by such examples, not only the hearts of infidels were hardened against the truth, but the minds of weak brethren also much troubled, the Holy Ghost hath given sentence of these backsliders that they were carnal men and had not the Spirit of Christ Jesus, lest any man having an [over-estimate] of their persons should be overmuch amazed and offended at their fall. For simple men not able to discern their spirits, were brought by their apostasy thus to reason with themselves:</p>

<blockquote><div>if Christ be the Son of the living God, if he have the words of eternal life, if he be able to bring salvation to all men that come unto him, what meaneth this apostasy and unconstrained departure? Why do his servants so willingly forsake him?</div></blockquote>

<p>Babes, be not deceived. His servants forsake him not. They that separate themselves were amongst his servants, but if they had been of his servants, they had not separated themselves. "They were amongst us, not of us," saith St John (1 John 2.19). And St Jude proveth it, because they were carnal and had not the Spirit.<br><br>Will you judge of wheat by chaff which the wind hath scattered from amongst it? Have the children no bread because the dogs have not tasted it? Are Christians deceived of that salvation they look for, because they denied the joys of the life to come [to those] which were no Christians?<br><br>What if they seemed to be pillars and principal upholders of our faith? What is that to us, which know that angels have fallen from heaven? Although if these men had been of us indeed (O the blessedness of a Christian man's estate!), they had stood surer than the angels; they had never departed from their place. Whereas now we marvel not at their departure at all. Neither are we prejudiced by their falling away, because they were not of us since they are fleshly and have not the Spirit. Children abide in the house for ever. They are bondmen and bondwomen which are cast out.<br><br>13. It behoveth you, therefore greatly, every man to examine his own estate and try whether you be bond or free, children or no children. I have told you already, that we must beware we presume not to sit as gods in judgment upon others, and rashly, as our conceit and fancy doth lead us, so to determine of this man "he is sincere", or of that man "he is an hypocrite", [unless] by their falling away they make it manifest and known what they are.<br><br>For who are thou that takest upon thee to judge another before the time? Judge thyself. God hath left us infallible evidence whereby we may at any time give true and righteous sentence upon ourselves. We cannot examine the hearts of other men. We may our own.<br><br>"That we have passed from death to life, we know it," saith St John, "because we love our brethren" (1 John 3.14); and "know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, [unless] ye be reprobates" (2 Corinthians 13.5)? I trust, beloved, we know that we are not reprobates, because our spirit doth bear us record, that the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ is in us.<br><br>14. It is an easy matter for the spirit within you to tell whose ye are, as for the eyes of your body to judge where you sit, or in what place you stand. For what saith the Scripture?</p>

<blockquote><div>Ye which were in times past strangers and enemies because your minds were set on evil works, Christ hath now reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and unblameable and without fault in his sight; if you continue grounded and established in the faith, and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel" (Colossians 1.21-23).</div></blockquote>

<p>And in the third to the Colossians, "Ye know, that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of that inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ" (Colossians 3.24). [And that is true] if we can make this account with ourselves:</p>

<blockquote><div>I was in times past dead in trespasses and sins. I walked after the prince that ruleth in the air and after the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience. But God, who is rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith he loved me, even when I was dead, hath quickened me in Christ. I was fierce, heady, proud, high-minded. But God hath made me like the child that is newly weaned. I loved pleasures more than God. I followed greedily the joys of this present world. I esteemed him that erected a stage or theatre more than Solomon which built a temple to the Lord. The harp, viol, timbrel, and pipe, men-singers and women-singers were at my feast. It was my felicity to see my children dance before me (Job 21.11). I said of every kind of vanity, 'O how sweet art thou in my soul!' All which things now are crucified to me and I to them. Now I hate the pride of life and pomp of this world. Now 'I take as great delight in the way of thy testimonies, O Lord, as in all riches' (Psalm 119.14). Now I find more joy of heart in my Lord and Saviour than the worldly-minded man when 'his wheat and oil do much abound'. Now I taste nothing sweet but the 'bread that came down from heaven, to give life unto the world' (John 6.33). Now mine eyes see nothing but Jesus rising from the dead. Now my ear refuseth all kind of melody to hear the song of them that have gotten victory of the beast and of his image and of his mark and of the number of his name, that stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God, and singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 'Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are they ways, O King of Saints' (Rev 15.2-3).</div></blockquote>

<p>Surely, if the Spirit have been thus effectual in the secret work of our regeneration unto newness of life; if we endeavour thus to frame ourselves anew; then we may say boldly with the blessed apostle in the tenth of Hebrews: "We are not of them which withdraw ourselves to perdition, but which follow faith to the conservation of the soul" (Hebrews 10.39).<br><br>For they that fall away from the grace of God and separate themselves unto perdition, they are fleshly and carnal; they have not God's holy Spirit. But unto you, "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts" (Gal 4.6), to the end ye might know that Christ hath built you upon a rock unmoveable; that he hath registered your names in the Book of Life; that he hath bound himself in a sure and everlasting covenant to be your God, and the God of your children after you; that he hath suffered as much, groaned as oft, prayed as heartily for you, as for Peter: "O Father, keep them in thy name. O righteous Father, the world hath not known that thou hast sent me. I have declared thy name unto them and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them" (John 17.25-26).<br><br>The Lord of his infinite mercy give us hearts plentifully fraught with the treasure of this blessed assurance of faith unto the end!<br><br>15. Here I must advertise all men that have the testimony of God's holy fear within their breasts, to consider how unkindly and injuriously our own countrymen and brethren have dealt with us by the space of four and twenty years from time to time, as if we were the men of whom St Jude here speaketh, never ceasing to charge us, some with schism, some with heresy, some with plain and manifest apostasy, as if we had clean separated ourselves from Christ, utterly forsaken God, quite abjured heaven, and trampled all truth and all religion under our feet.<br><br>Against this third sort [apostasy], God himself shall plead our cause in that day, when they shall answer us for these words, not we them.<br><br>To others, by whom we are accused for schism and heresy, we have often made our reasonable and in the sight of God, I trust, allowable answers.<br><br>For in the way which they call heresy, "we worship the God of our fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets" (Acts 24.14).<br><br>That which they call schism, we know to be our reasonable service unto God and obedience to his voice which crieth shrill in our ears, "Go out of Babylon, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues" (Revelation 18.4).<br><br>And therefore when they rise up against us having no quarrel but this, we need not seek any farther for our apology than the words of Abiah to Jeroboam and his army: "O Jeroboam and Israel, hear you me. Ought you not to know, that the Lord God of Israel hath given the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt" - that is to say, an everlasting covenant (2 Chronicles 13.5).<br><br>Jesuits and papists, hear ye me. Ought you not to know that the Father hath given all power unto the Son and hath made him the only head over his Church, wherein he dwelleth as an husbandman in the midst of his vineyard, manuring it with the sweat of his own brows, not letting it forth to others? For, as it is in the Canticles, "Solomon had a vineyard in Baalhamon; he gave the vineyard unto keepers, every one bringing for the fruit thereof a thousand pieces of silver" (Song of Songs 8.11).<br><br>"But my vineyard, which is mine, is before me," saith Christ. It is true, this is meant of the mystical head set over the body, which is not seen.<br><br>But as he hath reserved the mystical administration of the Church invisible unto himself, so he hath committed the mystical government of congregations visible to the sons of David, by the same covenant. Whose sons they are in the governing of the flock of Christ, whomsoever the Holy Ghost hath set over them, to go before them, and to lead them in their several pastures - one in this congregation, another in that. As it is written:</p>

<blockquote><div>Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock whereof the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20.28).</div></blockquote>

<p>Neither will ever any pope or papist under the cope of heaven be able to prove the Romish bishop's usurped supremacy over all churches by any one word of the covenant of salt, which is the Scripture. For the children in our streets do now laugh them to scorn when they force "thou art Peter" to this purpose.<br><br>The pope hath no more reason to draw the charter of his universal authority from hence, than the brethren had to gather by the words of Christ in the last of St John, that the disciple whom Jesus loved should never die. "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee," saith Christ (John 21.22-23). Straigthways a report was raised amongst the brethren that his disciple should not die. Yet Jesus said not to him, "he shall not die," but "if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="a) Doubt">(December 1997) a) Doubt</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1997</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Thomas</b><br><br>The most famous "doubter" in the Bible is the apostle Thomas - commonly described as "doubting Thomas". He simply could not believe in the resurrection of Jesus. The other disciples came to believe, but not Thomas. Why was that? John's Gospel supplies the answer. It was "because he was not with them when Jesus came" (John 20.24). Thomas kept himself apart from the other disciples. He was absent when the risen Jesus appeared to them.<br><br>This is still a fundamental cause of doubt - a person's separation from the Christian community or fellowship. If you keep away from where the Bible is intelligently and carefully preached, if you don't put yourself in the way of Christian literature that is positive and helpful, if you don't let other Christians help you with your queries and questions, don't be surprised if you find faith difficult.<br><br>John Wesley used to say that there is no such thing as a "solitary Christian". Charles Spurgeon used the analogy of the coal in the fire. While the coal is in the fire it glows hot. Take it out and lay it on the hearth and it grows cold. The Christian is like the coal.<br><br>When we are outside an active Christian fellowship, it is so easy to drift from the faith. C.S.Lewis once observed:</p>

<blockquote><div>If you examined a hundred people who had lost their faith in Christianity, I wonder how many of them would turn out to have been reasoned out of it by honest argument? Do not most people simply drift away?</div></blockquote>

<p>Sadly, you see this happen to a number of people in churches. The "worries of this life" as Jesus put it in the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4.19), often are all that is needed to start a drift. This then leads to a creeping paralysis of faith.<br><br>This happened to Charles Darwin (the evolutionist):</p>

<blockquote><div>I gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation ... disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete.</div></blockquote>

<p>The devil in Lewis's The Screwtape Letters puts it so well:</p>

<blockquote><div>The safest road to Hell is the gradual one - the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Scepticism</b><br><br>There is also undue scepticism. That is not at all uncommon. There are some people who are always asking for evidence but are never open to conviction. <br><br>The Pharisees in the New Testament were just like that (and their successors are still with us). Jesus called them "a wicked and adulterous generation" (Matthew 12.39). They were always asking for a "sign". But they had signs enough. As Peter could say without fear of contradiction in his Pentecost sermon: "Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs" (Acts 2.22).<br><br>But many of the Jews simply did not want to submit to Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord. It was a question of the "will", not the intellect.<br><br>There are, of course, real doubts. As Os Guinness puts it:</p>

<blockquote><div>This is the point at which to separate those who are doubting because they need answers from those who are doubting because they need doubts.</div></blockquote>

<p>One real problem people have from time to time is over the nature of proof. "How", they ask, "can you be really sure? Yes, the arguments given are very good, but can we be certain?"<br><br>The trouble often begins when we do not have a wide enough idea of what it means to "prove" something. Too often we think exclusively of "mathematical" proofs. Or we think of "logical" proofs, where the meanings of the words almost ensure that a conclusion is right. "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal."<br><br>But that is only one sort of proving. We mustn't be held prisoner by it. There are all sorts of other ways we prove things. For example a Romeo proves his love for a Juliet in countless ways that have nothing to do with mathematical or logical proofs. <br><br>There is a range of methods by which we reach certainty - enough certainty. The important thing is to ask yourself two questions: "Am I looking for the appropriate sort of proof?" and "Am I aware of what is a reasonable amount of certainty for action?"<br><br>The simple fact is that in everything apart from what philosophers call "necessary truths" - mathematical and logical truths - there is no such thing as "absolute certainty of a mathematical sort". So what? Indeed, this is what makes life interesting. And this is particularly true of human relationships. You only become certain about people as you get to know them. As Michael Green has well said: "The appropriate way to assure yourself of the reality of persons is to meet them, not to try to prove them."<br><br>The Christian says it is a bit like that with the risen Jesus Christ. The more you have dealings with him and the more you develop a relationship with him, the more certain you become. That is not to say that Christians don't have questions and sometimes doubts. But they are sufficiently certain. This is not about everything. In many things "now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror" (1 Corinthians 13.12). However, over the essentials they are sufficiently certain to be able to love, serve and obey God.<br><br><br><b>Commitment</b><br><br>Some people will still doubt that Christian "proving" and certainty is reasonable. They will put Christian believing in much the same class as a toss of a coin - heads I win, tails you lose. It's a matter of chance. Alan Watts once said: "Without disrespect it must be said that Christianity is pre-eminently the gamblers' religion."<br><br>It was the 17th century Frenchman, Pascal, who originally used the analogy of "gambling" in thinking of faith. He taunted the sceptics of his own day, who doubted the existence of God and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, over their reckless gambling habits. They were prepared, he said, to stake huge fortunes in their gambling with far less chance of being winners or proved right in their bets than are Christians in their beliefs.<br><br>Pascal certainly didn't mean, however, that Christian belief was merely a "luckier" draw. He used the analogy of gambling to emphasise commitment. His point was this:</p>

<blockquote><div>We cannot wait until our reason has carefully weighed all the pros and cons, the less so since the existence of God can never be proved by reason alone. In the meantime we waste our life in indecision ... Let us take the risk, therefore, let us boldly dare to believe, even though merely on the strength of a vague probability.</div></blockquote>

<p>The point is well made (even if we think that the probability is not vague but high). Practical decisions can't wait for ever. And a decision to accept and follow Jesus Christ is a practical decision. It is going his way and not ours. We will do different things if we are Christians to what we will do if we are not.<br><br>In many areas of life you cannot remain uncommitted for ever. Sometimes you have to "jump". And even in situations where the evidence is strong and clear, you can always carry on asking questions to avoid commitment.<br><br>Imagine a rather odd person - odd because he wants 100 percent certainty - on a station platform. He wants to know when is his next train home. He asks the porter who tells him, "5.00 pm". But he wants to make sure; after all the porter may have got it wrong. So he goes back to the booking office and sees the official timetable. There it is - 5.00 pm. However, he thinks: "that might be a misprint" or "they might have changed the schedules today. I better check with the stationmaster." While doing so, he looks at his watch. It now says, 5.01 pm. He looks back to the platform and there he sees the train slowly pulling away. He has missed it.<br><br>In practical situations you cannot remain uncommitted for ever. And you cannot remain uncommitted to Jesus Christ for ever. He is coming again!<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Twenty-five Years">(January 1998) Twenty-five Years</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 1998</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>On Tuesday 16 January 1973, 25 years ago, I was instituted at Jesmond Parish Church. All I can remember now of the Institution Service is the opening hymn. It was Wesley's great hymn that begins:</p>

<blockquote><div>O for a thousand tongues to singMy great Redeemer's praise,The glories of my God and King,The triumphs of His grace.</div></blockquote>

<p>The hymn then defines those "glories" and "triumphs" in an amazing way -giving a wonderful statement of basic Christian truth - "Jesus! The name that charms our fears." "He breaks the power of cancelled sin." "He speaks, and, listening to His voice, New life the dead receive." And the conclusion is the prayer: "My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim, To spread through all the earth abroad, The honours of Thy name."<br><br>The church at that point was relatively small in congregational size. In fact when I was being interviewed by the then archdeacon, he said that we would probably have to close within the next six years as there would be no people left to form a congregation. Such, he said, would be the effect of the new motorway. I saw things differently and agreed to come to Jesmond because I believed the church should grow, in spite of the problems. That opening line of the hymn was something of a challenge: "O for a thousand tongues to sing". We can now thank God that after 25 five years he has answered the prayer - the first prayer I ever prayed in Jesmond Parish Church. Jonathan [Pryke] tells me that there were 1,360 at the evening services yesterday [I am writing this the day after the first Carols by Candlelight service].<br><br>I now believe that during the next period of our church's life here at Jesmond, we should all pray, and then work, for answers to the prayer in the final verse of the hymn: "Assist me to proclaim, to spread through all the earth abroad, the honours of thy name." Surely we must pray and work for greater growth not just in Jesmond but on Tyneside and further afield.<br><br><br><b>Privilege</b><br><br>It has been a huge privilege to be able to work here on Tyneside for 25 years. First, it is a wonderful place. For fifteen years I was on the General Synod of the Church of England. In the last five years (under Robert Runcie) I was on its Standing Committee and had to be in London, on average, once or more every week. But the joy of crossing the Tyne in the returning train, in the evening, if not "unspeakable", was very considerable.<br><br>I always feel I can breathe (psychologically) up here. I genuinely believe we have a saner and more healthy perspective on life than in many parts of the country. That may be due to Tyneside being a Metropolitan area (and therefore not narrowly parochial) while at the same time not being too big. It is easier for us to understand the "whole picture". Certainly that is true in professional work. My wife, for example, as a doctor working in the community seems to have a knowledge and understanding of such a wide range of people, and problems - and right across the social spectrum. I know that is true for many others in the congregation. For myself, over the years I have developed a wide range of contacts in many areas of life that I don't think I could have done so easily in London or Manchester.<br><br>And then there is the countryside. One of the national tourist agencies was recently describing Northumberland as the best kept secret in Britain. The coast (including Tynemouth) but, of course, north of Alnmouth is superb. My favourite walk - a walk as good as anywhere - is by the sea from Craster to Dunstanburgh. Then there are the Cheviots; the Hadrian's Wall country; and the various reaches of the Tyne. What could be better?<br><br>And the people are wonderful. It is not "saving grace" but certainly it is some of God's "common grace" that has come our region's way. In the North East there is an "easygoingness" that is not "sloppy"; but it means people are not pompous or pretentious. And there is a general friendliness. The result of all this is that my wife and I love the region.<br><br><br><b>Developments</b><br><br>When I came to the church in 1973, outside the church [where the motorway now is] was Jesmond Road. This was a tree-lined road that went straight past the church and up to the Great North Road where there were almighty traffic jams. Through-traffic came over the Tyne Bridge and up Northumberland Street and on to Scotland. But in the summer of 1973 the bulldozers came in and for a long time the church was in an island of mud, with a sixty-foot-deep great excavation six feet from the church tower. That is when I learnt to say "No!" to irresponsible authorities. This massive hole was for the Metro tunnel that was being put in place for the future Metro before the motorway was built over it. But the church could have been undermined and the tower even fallen into the hole had we not insisted on certain precautions.<br><br>Also when I came to the church in 1973, some parts of our area of Jesmond were, in environmental terms, "degenerating". Drugs were coming in, so was crime and some prostitution. This was the time of T.Dan Smith, Poulson and Co. One of their "colleagues" had bought up a number of properties in Jesmond. that were put into multiple accommodation and became pretty seedy. Someone in the planning department, told me, they were waiting to see how the area developed. They were prepared for it to go down further. It was noted that the area by the church was now being made into a cul-de-sac; and with the schools inactive at week-ends it could mean undesirable elements being "sucked in" off the Metro.<br><br>However, Jesmond Parish Church prevented that happening, I was told. With a full programme at week-ends at the church, there was no "dead" area. It helped, that early in my time at Jesmond, church families started to buy houses to be near the church; and one family "de-flatted" a property. The Jesmond Trust also did that to a property in Otterburn Villas North (in Otterburn Terrace) for a married staff member. That is when the Trust was originally set up to help us keep control of our property (and money), otherwise it would have come under diocesan control. (Otterburn Villas North was subsequently sold and replaced by 56 Holly Avenue - now the home of the Redfearns).<br><br>All this had a knock-on effect. It was locally being rumoured that families were coming back. As houses were cheap, it made sense for other families to buy and settle in the area. The result, many years later, is that the value of those same properties is high; and they are now "desirable residences".<br><br><br><b>Analysis</b><br><br>More important than roads and houses is the spiritual condition of the church. Our founders' requirement for the church is a good test. They said we are to be:</p>

<blockquote><div>a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound Scriptural and evangelical truth a large and populous town.</div></blockquote>

<p>My prayer, and my commitment, is for the fellowship here, as we look to the future, to continue to try to be such a central point. Today more than ever before we need "sound scriptural and evangelical truth".<br><br>1970's saw the rise of the charismatic movement. People focused on the person and work of the Holy Spirit. This was the period when David Watson, a charismatic leader, was effective in evangelism (as we experienced at Jesmond and on Tyneside with Celebrate the Faith). But the bible sometimes became marginalized as people wanted prophecies, visions and miracles instead. The 1980's saw the rise of the Church Growth movement. It was now seen that if people were converted they needed to be assimilated into church fellowships. So there must be planned structures for growth. We at Jesmond, and I personally, learnt a great deal from the Church Growth movement. But the bible was sometimes marginalized as people thought you could organize for growth without the Spirit of God converting people and without the truth of God being taught.<br><br>The 1990's seem to be a time when many are getting back to the bible. If that is the wave of the future, let's go with it! There will be opposition. But as Wesley wrote: "He speaks, and, listening to his voice, new life the dead receive."<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>My personal goals for ministry are summed up in Paul's words in Colossians:</p>

<blockquote><div>We proclaim him [Jesus Christ], admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. To this end I labour, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me (Col 1.28-29).</div></blockquote>

<p>This is what, imperfectly, I have been aiming at over the past 25 years. I would value your prayers for the future as I shall try to keep to those same goals.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Jesmond Statement and the Continuing Story">(February 1998) The Jesmond Statement and the Continuing Story</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 1998</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>

<p>From time to time we have had to be firm in faithfulness to that trust in respect of our bishops. But until now there have only been two occasions in my 25 years that we have felt it right to take specific action. The first was in the time of the previous bishop of Durham, David Jenkins. He publicly (on TV) denied the virginal conception of Jesus and doubted his resurrection from an Empty Tomb. He caused huge confusion both on Tyneside and nationally; then he caused confusion in the House of Bishops as the initial response from the then Archbishops, Robert Runcie and John Habgood, was one of fudge. This suggested that any doctrinal view is compatible with the Christian faith (and certainly the Church of England).<br><br>For our part at that time we decided we could only have bishops coming to us at JPC (and who come principally for confirmations), who could affirm the biblical and orthodox faith. Personally I have a duty under my own ordination vows (in the language of the Ordinal in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer) to "be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's Word." Because of some confusing remarks from our own Bishop at that time over the virginal conception of Jesus and his Empty Tomb, the churchwardens, and then I myself, went to see him to explain our worries. On this occasion there was a happy outcome. In the vicar's note for February 1986 I was able to write as follows:<br><br>I have recently been in discussion with our own Bishop (of Newcastle) over these matters - before the House of Bishops has collectively reported. I am delighted to be able to write, with his agreement, that in the course of our discussion he made it quite clear that he personally believes in the facts of the Virginal Conception of Jesus and his Empty Tomb.<br><br><br><b>1996</b><br><br>The second occasion was ten years later in 1996 and the issue was the vexed question of homosexual relationships. Let me quote now from the vicar's note of December 1996:</p>

<blockquote><div>Many people were confused, distressed and, yes, angry over the celebration to mark 20 years of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement in Southwark Cathedral on 16 November. All this compounded the confusion that already existed from the publicised statements and certain actions of various individual bishops. Distress and problems had already been caused by the Bishops' Report Issues in Human Sexuality. In the summer to help dispel some of the confusion the evangelical group Reform argued that we needed a reaffirmation of the basic biblical teaching that has been the clear tradition of the Church down the centuries in this whole area of sexual and marital ethics. For clarity Reform said that we need to get back to:1) the received teaching of the church that all its members are to abstain from sexual relations outside holy (heterosexual) matrimony;2) the need for appropriate discipline within the church where there are sexual relations outside holy (heterosexual) matrimony, and3) the practice of ordaining only those who themselves will teach, and seek to model in their own lives, the received teaching of the church that all its members are to abstain from sexual relations outside holy (heterosexual) matrimony.Our own Bishop and assistant Bishop have assured me that they agree with these three propositions and have been arguing the same or similar points on a number of occasions. This is very encouraging. But please pray that there is clarity throughout the Church among bishops, clergy and laity alike.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>1997</b><br><br>The discussion that led to this vicar's note (December 1996) came about as the result of the following resolution of our own PCC:</p>

<blockquote><div>the PCC, in view of the serious confusion that has been caused in the Church over sexual relations, particularly homosexual relations, by the actions and words of individual bishops in the Anglican Communion and in the Church of England, and also by the ambiguous statement "Issues in Sexuality" from the House of Bishops, requests the vicar to consider only inviting for confirmation services bishops who have subscribed to Reform's threefold subscription - a subscription that reflects biblical and traditional teaching - so as not to cause confusion to young Christians and new converts.</div></blockquote>

<p>In our discussions I explained to the former Bishop that this resolution would have implications for his successor. "You will have to sort that out when he is appointed," was the reply. "Sorting that out" is more complicated than I expected. That is because the person appointed as Alec Graham's successor was a suffragan bishop from Southwark (the diocese where the Gay Celebration had been held), Martin Wharton. But at least the problem surfaced immediately. At an otherwise low key initial press conference, he was highly controversial over the subject of homosexuality. He was reported in the Evening Chronicle as saying:</p>

<blockquote><div>I believe passionately in a diverse, inclusive and tolerant church ... I follow the church line that homosexuality within a loving permanent relationship is no sin, but I think it would be inappropriate within the priesthood.</div></blockquote>

<p>Sadly, this is not an exceptional position for a bishop to take today in the Church of England. That is why, personally, I am sorry that the public exposure of this particular problem has to focus on the new Bishop of Newcastle. His is a representative position. There are other bishops who have more extreme views. But this view of Martin Wharton, as reported in the press, has been known as his view in Southwark for some time - namely that loving permanent homosexual relationships among the laity are permitted by the Church. And he believes that the statement from the Bishops' Issues in Human Sexuality allows for that. He summarized his position on BBC Look North (17 June 1997), in respect of homosexual sex as follows - these were his actual words (and so cannot be rejected as misreporting):</p>

<blockquote><div>The Church through its statement from the House of Bishops has come to say it is possible to accept that faithful, lifelong, committed and permanent relationships are permitted - certainly amongst the lay-members of the church, but that cannot be the position for the priests.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Unbiblical</b><br><br>This is clearly unbiblical. The arguments why are to be found in the Addendum to the Jesmond Statement. And being unbiblical is in defiance of Canon C 18.1, the basic canon that gives the job definition of a bishop and that says: "it appertains to his office to teach and to uphold sound and wholesome doctrine and to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange opinions."<br><br>But I personally did not want to get into interminable arguments and certainly we had no intention of taking any one to court over doctrinal matters. However something had to be done. So a fairly forceful point was made in the Jesmond Statement and on behalf of the PCC I asked the Archbishop of York for alternative oversight. He replied the first time suggesting more dialogue. I replied with my Reply to the Archbishop of York. I explained why, in my judgment, the way forward was not to have "cosy chats" with the new bishop. The issues were over fundamental doctrinal error. As I had sent the Jesmond Statement and my Reply to Martin Wharton, he knew that the only way to solve the problem, from our point of view, would be to say (publicly) that he had changed his views since the press conference in June; that he no longer agreed with his position as articulated in Southwark; and that he would subscribe to the Reform propositions. He did not do that and he has not done that. That is why we are still appealing to the Archbishop of York under his duty "to correct and supply the defects of other bishops" (Canon C 17.2). The "defect" in this case is the clear defiance of Canon C 18.1. But others, too, were beginning to see the problem and take action.<br><br>Not long after the Jesmond Statement was published another church in Newcastle issued a statement as follows on 7 December 1997:</p>

<blockquote><div>The PCC. of St. Mark, Byker and St. Oswald, Walkergate affirms its adherence to the Bible's teaching, and that it will therefore only be in fellowship with those leaders in the Anglican Communion who are orthodox in their faith and morals, as expressed in the Kuala Lumpur Statement on Human Sexuality.</div></blockquote>

<p>This means that, in the light of his public statements on homosexual behaviour, we cannot, as things stand, accept the oversight of the new Bishop of Newcastle, Martin Wharton - not on personal grounds, but on grounds of doctrine and morality. Bishop Martin's views are totally unacceptable to us.<br><br>We wish to emphasize that this is not a personal matter, but a public issue of faith and morals. The Bishop has spoken publicly of his views on homosexuality. Therefore we feel constrained to make our position public too.<br><br>The cause of the gospel in England and overseas is greatly hindered by unbiblical, public pronouncements of Anglican leaders in England, the rest of the United kingdom and overseas.<br><br><br><b>The High Court</b><br><br>This statement was picked up by the Journal newspaper on 8 December 1997 and the focus now shifted to Ed Moll. Ed was a prospective curate for St Oswald's Walkergate who was expecting to be ordained in Newcastle Cathedral on 21 December 1997. On 9 December, the day after the Journal report he was summoned to a meeting with the acting Bishop (Kenneth Gill) and the Archdeacon of Northumberland. He wisely took his vicar, Ken Moulder, with him. Ed Moll has subsequently reported on what followed in a briefing and it is corroborated by Ken. Ed wrote that at the meeting it was made clear that unless he refuted his PCC's statement he could not be ordained on 21 December. But quite properly he was not willing to accept this additional condition that was placed uncanonically on his ordination; nor was he able to condone unbiblical teaching. He was, however, willing to swear the oath of (canonical) obedience. That is because it is made to the office and not to an individual person ("the Lord Bishop of Newcastle, his heirs and successors" and not to "Martin Wharton"); and most importantly the "obedience" is limited by the words "in all things lawful and honest". That means that obedience can never be unquestioning; and there can never be obedience in an area that is unbiblical. However, the Assistant bishop was not prepared to administer the oath without the prior refutation of the PCC. That meant that Ed was withdrawn from ordination at the Cathedral on 21 December 1997.<br><br>So in the word's of the briefing:</p>

<blockquote><div>Ed Moll's ordination had been stopped because he and his parish wanted to adhere to orthodox Christian biblical teaching on human sexuality. He was already fit for ordination, and had been since Summer 1997 (an ordination to coincide with his arrival in September had been postponed because no bishop was available).</div></blockquote>

<p>The briefing then went on:</p>

<blockquote><div>Further delay would both impair the ministry of St Oswald's, and confirm the difficulty of being ordained while holding fast to traditional orthodox Christian teaching. An alternative ordination was therefore planned, at very short notice, to be carried out at St Oswald's on 21 December by a retired missionary bishop. A High Court Injunction was sought by the acting bishop, Kenneth Gill, against the retired missionary bishop, the vicar and the churchwardens of St Oswald's to prevent the ordination. After a four-hour hearing, the injunction was granted at the high court in Middlesborough against the retired bishop and the vicar for three months to prevent a possible breach of canon law. Apparently this is the first time a High Court injunction has been used to deal with canon law. No ordination was held on 21 December for Ed.</div></blockquote>

<p>This was all quite disgraceful. It was very wrong (see 1 Corinthians 6.1 and 6) for the assistant bishop, acting with the full knowledge of Bishop Wharton, to appeal to a secular court over what in reality is a doctrinal matter. The court, not being an ecclesiastical court, could not discuss, nor would allow discussion of, the doctrinal issues at all. But in this case doctrine is everything. To add insult to injury and symptomatic of what is going on there then was the diocesan account of what happened. This was given in the report in the diocesan newspaper, The new Link, for January. It says: "an injunction (lasting three months) was granted preventing the ordination of Ed Moll, of St Oswald's, Walkergate, following his refusal to make the oath of obedience to the diocesan bishop, as required by the ordination service." That is absolutely untrue. Ed was willing to take the oath of obedience.<br><br><br><b>Further fudge</b><br><br>Ken Moulder asked me to represent him at the High Court. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to read out in Court a letter of Ed Moll to bishop Wharton that he sent before the hearing on 17 December. Ken particularly wanted me to make it public. It makes it crystal clear what are the issues and the only way they can be resolved by Martin Wharton. Ed Moll wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>I am writing to ask you for written and unambiguous clarification of your views on the issues of human sexuality. The serious doctrinal and moral nature of the issues involved, and the public exposure of your reported views make a clear, unambiguous, written statement by you essential to establishing your position on these issues.</div></blockquote>

<p>I am sure you will understand the importance of a written statement of clarification, and the need to deal with press reports of your public views. I can only repeat the suggestions contained in Rev K Moulder's communication sent to you last week, and ask that your statement consist of the three areas he indicated, namely (1) your public affirmation of the Reform propositions, (2) our support for the Kuala Lumpur Statement, and (3) your assurance that you no longer hold the view reported in the Press on Tyneside that "homosexuality within a loving permanent relationship is no sin", and the same view expressed more fully to more than a dozen witnesses at Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon.<br><br>I have been informed that Bishop Wharton simply replied in the terms he has used before, namely that however he expressed himself at his press conference last June and however his comments have been interpreted, he stands firmly with the statement of the House of Bishops' Issues in Human Sexuality and this is the framework within which he exercises his ministry. That is quite inadequate. According to Bishop Wharton's own words on TV (as we have seen), Issues in Human Sexuality in his judgment permits homosexual sex among the laity. So the situation for our friends at Walkergate is quite unresolved. Ed is staying on as a diocesan layworker until the end of March. Who knows what will happen then?<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>What is happening at Jesmond? I am in correspondence still with the Archbishop of York about "alternative oversight". This has become all the more necessary as I personally am being attacked by the Newcastle diocesan authorities. There are attempts to stop Ian Garrett preaching and Jonathan Redfearn giving us clerical assistance. This too is quite disgraceful. But let me conclude with five propositions.<br><br>One, the fundamental issues are doctrinal and in particular the view that "homosexuality within a loving, permanent relationship is no sin". Bishop Wharton has in no way retracted this view or resolved the problem. Further press reports have made the problems worse.<br><br>Two, what was and is needed is not face to face discussion but simple "yes/no" answers. The avoidance of ambiguity is necessary when there is such confusion. Clear answers have been studiously avoided.<br><br>Three, as I have said, I never wanted to get involved in interminable arguments. And we at Jesmond had no intention of taking any one to court. Most of us simply wanted to make a fairly forceful point and then have oversight that would enable us to get on with evangelism and biblical ministry on the one hand, and on the other hand prevent doctrinal or moral confusion that would hinder the work of the gospel on Tyneside.<br><br>Four, with the doctrinal issues unresolved, of course, there may be consequential secondary problems in terms of Anglican irregularities or untidiness on the part of those seeking to be faithful. And opposition from those who want to attack these irregularities without first dealing with the fundamental problems will cause a huge wastage of time, energy and money. This is especially so if Bishop Wharton condones taking people to court.<br><br>Five, the issues are spiritual. So remember that God is in control. Then pray. Then focus on Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 16.9 - they seem so relevant to us at Jesmond Parish Church: "a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me." Then forget this sorry story and concentrate on the "great door for effective work" that Jesus Christ by his Holy Spirit has opened for us here on Tyneside.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Fundamentalism, Evolution and Creation">(March 1998) Fundamentalism, Evolution and Creation</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 1998</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Screwtape</b><br><br>Hugh Montefiore, the former bishop of Birmingham, a year or two ago wrote as a book review in the Church Times the following letter. It was in the style of one of C.S.Lewis' Screwtape Letters and entitled, "a theory unnaturally selected". (It is here reprinted with permission).<br><br><br>Dear Wormwood,<br><br>I am writing because I want more precautions taken to safeguard our position on the scientific front. The general belief in the West that Darwinism explains the evolution of species has been our greatest triumph, and has given enormous satisfaction to our Father Below.<br><br>The assumption that mankind has emerged from a purposeless process of evolution resulting from the accumulation of small random mutations which were to the advantage of individual members of a species, and made them fitter to survive, has robbed millions of faith in the existence of the Enemy, or reduced him to the status of a "blind watchmaker".<br><br>But I scent danger ahead. You have done very well to prevent reviews of small and easy-to-read books like Darwin on Trial (Monarch, 1994). The eminence of its author Philip E. Johnson, a Berkeley law professor, and his disclosure of the threadbare nature of our arguments, could have done us great damage.<br><br>Fortunately, we have been so successful that anyone who tries to debunk neo-Darwinism is generally regarded by society as a crank. You must keep on preventing those scientists who are adherents of the Enemy from criticising evolution through natural selection. You must try to spread abroad the idea that the only alternative to Darwinism is the belief that the world was created by the Enemy in six days. Don't try to persuade people that Darwinism is true - we know it isn't - but that there is no alternative explanation that is credible today.<br><br>A few practical hints. If anyone objects that there is no concrete evidence that any new species has actually evolved by micromutations, divert attention from the facts by saying it is logically possible. Suggest that major changes might in principle come about through small mutations in an embryo, but never try to explain how, for example, a reptile producing eggs could turn into a mammal producing live young.<br><br>When it comes to fossils, beware of the palaeontologists, because they tend to be against us. No transitional intermediates have ever been found in the vertebrate sequence or elsewhere; so hammer on about animals with similarities to two classes, and never mention the differences, or why there were sudden extinctions or why some species persist for millions of years. So you should hide the fact that the fossil problem is getting worse, not better. Pretend that we simply need to find more fossils. Assert that similarities in molecular structure between species prove a common ancestry - although, of course, they don't.<br><br>What really scares me is the thought that some well-known biologist may say that anyone looking objectively at the evidence would regard Darwinism as highly improbable. But it's unlikely: too many vested interests are at stake.<br><br>Your affectionate uncle,<br><br>SCREWTAPE<br><br><br><b>Evolution</b><br><br>The old certainties with regard to evolution are being challenged today. As Philip E. Johnson says:<br><br>Every history of the twentieth century lists three thinkers as preeminent in influence: Darwin, Marx and Freud. All three were regarded as "scientific" (and hence far more reliable than anything "religious") in their heyday. Yet Marx and Freud have fallen, and even their dwindling bands of followers no longer claim that their insights were based on any methodology remotely comparable to that of experimental science. I am convinced that Darwin is the next on the block. His fall will be by far the mightiest of the three.<br><br>And that will be highly significant because popular Darwinism has been used to dethrone God. As the philosopher of science Del Ratz puts it, "Evolution, along with the new cosmologies and backed by the undentable prestige of science, became part of a gratifyingly sophisticated excuse for unbelief - a ticket out of an oppressive universe with a God who set boundaries and made demands, into one where we set the rules and the cosmos itself was the only limit." Darwinism became a new secular "religion". The serious consequences have especially been seen in our schools. An official American 1995 "Position Statement" for biology teachers, excluding any divine design or control, reads as follows:<br><br>The diversity of life on earth is the outcome of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable and natural process of temporal descent with genetic modification that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies and changing environments.<br><br>So how is this confidence being challenged?<br><br>There are three areas that come together in the debate on evolution: one, the scientific; two, the philosophical; and three, the theological. In all areas there are now serious questions being asked.<br><br>In the scientific area it is now being seen that Darwin's The Origin of Species had a level of plausibility in 1859 more because of the culture of unbelief that was developing at that time than because of its scientific merit. That unbelief was evidenced, for example, in the book of theologically liberal essays published the following year and entitled Essays and Reviews.<br><br>There was nothing new in "evolution" as such. Lamarck, a French zoologist had earlier published Zoological Philosophy in 1809. This spoke of life in its simplest form emerging from nonlife by small steps and in increasing complexity. But Darwin's theory caught on where Lamarck's had not because of the theory of "natural selection" which gained natural law status and seemed a hidden power. It told how it all happened. T.H.Huxley, who described himself as "Darwin's bulldog", referred to the hypothesis of natural selection like this:<br><br>That which we were looking for, and could not find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known organic forms which assumed the operation of no causes but such as could be proved to be actually at work. The Origin provided us with the working hypothesis we sought. Moreover, it did the immense service of freeing us for ever from the dilemma - refuse to accept the creation hypothesis, and what have you to propose that can be accepted by any cautious reasoner?<br><br><br><b>Questions</b><br><br>People wanted to escape from the "creation hypothesis". Natural selection enabled them to do that. Confirmation that there were clearly anti-religious drives and motives in wanting to find such a hypothesis comes from Richard Dawkins, the contemporary Oxford Zoologist. He writes: "Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist." Dawkins now promotes this atheism with evolutionary zealotry. But his is only one side of the story. A senior palaeontologist at the British Natural History Museum, Colin Patterson, along with many others reflects the more sceptical side. Not so long ago at a lecture for experts in his field he asked his audience the following question:</p>

<blockquote><div>Can you tell me anything you know about evolution, any one thing ... that is true? </div></blockquote>

<p>I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said "I do know one thing - it ought not to be taught in high school."<br><br>Patterson went on to suggest that both evolution and creationism are forms of pseudo-knowledge. His subsequent remarks do not allow us to be sure what he really thinks. But he indicates that not all is straightforward. One problem is that "evolution" can mean anything from the obvious truth that bacteria "evolve" resistance to certain antibiotics or so often "the fittest survive" to the metaphysical proposition that mankind "evolved" entirely by purposeless, mechanical forces. So first, we must ask, "are we talking about 'micro-evolution' within species? Or are we talking about the 'macro-evolution' of the cosmos?" The former clearly takes place. But is there any evidence for the latter?<br><br>More and more are saying "no!" Simple natural selection and the survival of the fittest, driving an ideology of evolution, has no longer the plausibility it once had. So the zoologist Pierre Grassé, speaking of Julian Huxley (T.H's grandson) and other evolutionary biologists, now says that their "evolution" was ...</p>

<blockquote><div>simply the observation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, geographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained practically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of circumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply evolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species [i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].</div></blockquote>

<p>But as significant as the questions over human evolution are the new findings in geology. Following the relatively recent eruption of Mount St Helens, the work of Steve Austin is reintroducing catastrophe theory. The volcano's eruption and the succeeding years have provided a real-time laboratory for testing theories of geological formation. What has been discovered is indeed mind stretching. The research has discovered that coal, canyons and rock layers, far from taking millions of years to develop can form in a few years if natural volcanic forces are large enough. This is all in sharp contrast to the ground breaking geological theories of men like James Hutton (1726-97) suggesting a general uniformitarianism and an absence of catastrophes (such as the flood). This uniformitarianism lead to the view in the 19th century that the earth's history consisted of successive, unimaginably long geological epochs. This was a necessary condition for Darwin's theories to be plausible. Also questions are now being raised about radiocarbon dating. One hypothesis concerns the decay of the earth's magnetic field, positing an exponential rate of decay thus giving a stronger magnetic field in the past. This would have shielded the earth from cosmic radiation and produced lower amounts of carbon 14. Whether this is convincing or not, little by little the unquestioned assumptions of ideological Darwinism are at least being put up for discussion.<br><br><br><b>Philosophy and the Bible</b><br><br>But the challenge is not only in matters of science. The philosophy of science is raising questions as to what is the logical nature of scientific hypotheses anyway. Are they to be considered "descriptions" of reality, or are some of them simply "models" that have built into them inferring techniques that help us solve problems. The model may be based on reality but it is not to be taken as a picture of reality.<br><br>And then there is the bible and fundamentalist exegesis. But here too not all is so simple. It is now recognized that the so called "fundamentalists" of the early part of the 20th century were far from being the bigots as popularly portrayed in films such as Inherit the Wind. The men, for example, who wrote the series of essays called The Fundamentals between 1910-1915 were for the most part distinguished scholars. B.B.Warfield, a fundamentalist of the fundamentalists and one of the essayists, was a Professor at Princeton, USA and an intellectual giant. He believed that evolution could be a method God used in creation. He actually was a theistic evolutionist. Another essayist and great fundamentalist, James Orr and a Professor of Theology in Glasgow, was concerned that evolution theory was denying the doctrine of original sin and the fall. "But if evolution is guided - and not necessarily slow, but proceeding with sudden mutations which introduce new factors - then the problem is changed. It may not be possible to prove that original man was sinless, but there is now room for such an origin." That is a summary of his views.<br><br>So how did the fundamentalists treat the bible? James Orr in volume 1 of The Fundamentals wrote this:<br><br>What I see in these narratives of Genesis is that, so true is the standpoint of the author, so divine the illumination with which he is endowed, so unerring his insight into the order of nature, there is little in his description that even yet, with our advanced knowledge, we need to change. You say there is the "six days" and the question whether those days are meant to be measured by the twenty-four hours of the sun's revolution around the earth - I speak of these things popularly. It is difficult to see how they should be so measured when the sun that is to measure them is not introduced until the fourth day. Do not think that this larger reading of the days is a new speculation. You find Augustine in early times declaring that it is hard or altogether impossible to say of what fashion these days are, and Thomas Aquinas, in the middle ages, leaves the matter an open question. To my mind these narratives in Genesis stand out as a marvel, not for its discordance with science, but for its agreement with it.<br><br>And he concludes:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is clear that the narratives of Creation, the Fall, the Flood, are not myths, but narratives enshrining the knowledge or memory of real transactions. The creation of the world was certainly not a myth, but a fact, and the representation of the stages of creation dealt likewise with facts. The language used was not that of modern science, but, under divine guidance, the sacred writer gives a broad, general picture which conveys a true idea of the order of the divine working in creation. Man's fall was likewise a tremendous fact, with universal consequences in sin and death to the race. Man's origin can only be explained through an exercise of direct creative activity, whatever subordinate factors evolution may have contributed. The flood was an historical fact, and the preservation of Noah and his family is one of the best and most widely attested of human traditions. In these narratives in Genesis and the facts which they embody is really laid the foundation of all else in the Bible. The unity of revelation binds them up with the Christian Gospel.</div></blockquote>

<p>So speaks the voice of Fundamentalism.<br><br><br><b>Other voices</b><br><br>It is wrong to think, however, that the problems of "origins and the bible" only surfaced for the first time with Darwin. Consider the following:</p>

<blockquote><div>Natural scientists and philosophers have attempted to explain nature or the world; but not one of their theories or suggestions has remained firm or unshaken; each has been over thrown by its successor ... Those for whom the concept of "God" is meaningless are unwilling to admit that a rational being was in control at the inception of the Universe ... Take the "materialists" - those who say matter is all there is, matter is ultimate, or put more technically, atoms, molecules etc (invisible entities) coalescing make up the visible world. It is because they don't know how to say, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Gen 1.1). An atheistic philosophy of the world has misled them; and it appears then that nothing governs or rules the Universe, but all is given up to mere chance.</div></blockquote>

<p>To guard us from such an error the writer of the creation narrative in Genesis, with his very first words, flashes into our minds the name of God. "In the beginning God created". What a glorious order. He first establishes a beginning. Then he adds "created" to show that what was made was a very small part of the power of the creator.<br><br>This was not from someone arguing against Darwin in the last century. This was from the pen of Basil of Cappadocia in the 4th century. Christians down the centuries have realised you have to respect the language of Genesis. Genesis 1-3 are clearly not like the Acts of the Apostles. Calvin in his Commentary on Genesis writing about "Let them be for lights" says:</p>

<blockquote><div>it is well again to repeat what I have said before, that it is not here philosophically discussed, how great the sun is in the heaven, and how great or how little is the moon; but how much light comes to us from them ... By this method (as I have before observed) the dishonesty of those men is sufficiently rebuked who censure Moses for not speaking with greater exactness. For as it became a theologian, he had respect to us rather than to the stars.</div></blockquote>

<p>In the early church Augustine believed that the earth, with all that is in it, was created in one instant. He had a "very big bang" theory. He said that the six days were introduced to help the mind grasp this concept. More recently Pope Pius XII spoke of the early part of Genesis in Humani Generis:</p>

<blockquote><div>Although it is not right to judge them by modern standards of historical composition, such as would be applied to the great classical authors, or to the learned of our own day, they do nevertheless come under the heading of history ... These chapters have a naïve, symbolical way of talking, well suited to the understanding of a primitive people. But they do disclose to us certain important truths.</div></blockquote>

<p><br>Chapters 1-3 of Genesis still raise certain questions. After nearly 150 years many people are thinking that Darwin does not provide the answers. Is it not wrong, therefore, to give the ideology of evolution a privileged place in our education today? The philosopher Stephen Toulmin has written of the theory of evolution as "scientific mythology". As a "myth" or "model" it may have value if it secures results. But it should not then be taught, with all the secular prejudices we are now so used to, as reflecting "what really happened" in history. T.H.Huxley invented the word "agnostic" with regard to belief in God. Surely agnosticism with regard to the theory of evolution is what is now called for.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Are they true?

                <p><i>The following is an extract (p 62ff) from the book "Where did Jesus Go? - The truth and meaning of the Resurrection" by DRJH.</i><br><br><br><b>John's Gospel</b><br><br>The Gospels are four different accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They are quite unique in the history of literature; they are not biographies in the modern sense. A disproportionate amount of them is given over to the last week of Jesus' life. John says of what he has written in his Gospel, especially the 'signs' - and the greatest sign is the Resurrection - that he has been selective. He has only written a fraction of what he could (John 21.25). He says:</p>

<blockquote><div>These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20.31).</div></blockquote>

<p>John clearly had a theological purpose. But he is not for the moment suggesting he is fabricating 'signs'. He says he makes his theological points by selection from actual incidents and events - that is what he thought he was doing; there is not the slightest hint he was making his theological points by the creation of imagined incidents and events. But can we trust John?<br><br>John's Gospel has been 'rehabilitated' in the second half of the twentieth century after a significant period of destructive and sceptical dismissal by academics. For many years it was said that John's Gospel was written late. It was said that the writer, whoever he was (and according to this view he certainly had nothing to do with the Apostle John of the twelve), just took Matthew, Mark and Luke and rewrote them. He rewrote the facts even. This was the reason, it was said, why John seems so different from the other three synoptic gospels (synoptic means literally 'seeing together'). But the argument went on like this: if John could freely rewrite the other existing Gospels, why shouldn't those other three have done just the same with their sources? Why not, indeed?<br><br>Then C.H.Dodd, a Cambridge New Testament scholar, gave the Sarum Lectures for 1954-55. These were published as Historical Tradition in the Fourth Gospel. He proved overwhelmingly that John was not dependent on the other Gospels for his sources. He did not rewrite them therefore. He couldn't have done. Rather, Dodd showed, in John's Gospel we have an independent tradition of material from Southern Palestine. We can't dismiss what John says about the Resurrection.<br><br>So when C.H.Dodd came to look at the narratives in John about the Resurrection and in particular Peter and John's visit to the tomb, he saw evidence of eyewitness rather than fabrication. He saw this in the account of the two Apostles' visit to the tomb. When they got there, they</p>

<blockquote><div>saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen" (John 20.6-7).</div></blockquote>

<p>The body of Jesus had been wrapped in long strips of cloth and spices had been put in between. The 'burial cloth' was a separate piece of linen wrapped over the head and under the chin to keep the jaw in place. What John's Gospel says is that when John saw the 'strips of linen' he believed. He believed, that is to say, not when he saw the empty tomb, but when he saw the 'burial cloth' still separate from the rest of the strips of linen wrappings that had been round the trunk and legs; it seemed as though the body had passed through the linen cloths. This was no resuscitation. It was a resurrection! The body had not revived, it had disappeared. "The story," says Dodd, "is told with dramatic realism of which this writer is master. It looks something as near first-hand evidence as we could hope to get. Perhaps it is, and if so, it becomes the sheet anchor of belief in a 'bodily resurrection'."<br><br>Again it was Dorothy Sayers who was quite convinced of the 'eyewitness' nature of John's Gospel. Looking at the Gospel as a novelist herself and so from the viewpoint of someone used to 'creating' or 'fabricating' stories, she says this: "It must be remembered that, of the four Evangelists, St John's is the only one that claims to be the direct report of an eyewitness. And to anyone accustomed to the imaginative handling of documents, the internal evidence bears out the claim."<br><br><br><b>Luke's Gospel</b><br><br>But John is not the only Gospel writer who tells us what he is aiming to do as he selects his material. Luke also tells us of his aims:</p>

<blockquote><div>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account" (Luke 1.1-3).</div></blockquote>

<p>Despite attempts to discredit Luke over the years, it is quite remarkable how he has withstood the test. Indeed what is noticeable is how modern experts who approach the New Testament from the view point of secular ancient history find Luke convincing. Those used to evaluating ancient documents and sources from the classical world of Greece and Rome say Luke is a good historian. A.N.Sherwin-White, a Roman Historian, was amazed at the scepticism of some New Testament critics. Having examined the New Testament, especially Luke and Acts, from the view point of Roman law and culture, he found it remarkably reliable.<br><br>One of the reasons why Luke has been 'attacked' is because he has an interest in the miraculous. This is undeniable. But G.B.Caird, an Oxford New Testament scholar, has written this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Sober criticism cannot get behind the gospel record to a plain, commonplace tale, devoid of the miraculous and the supernatural. The early Christians believed that, in Christ, God had been at work in new and astonishing ways and they had the evidence of their own eyes to support their faith. Luke cannot justly be accused of exaggerating the miraculous element in his narrative. He omits Mark's most difficult miracle, the story of the barren fig tree. It is true that he also goes one step beyond Mark in recording a cure performed at a distance by the word of command; but this story, the healing of the centurion's servant, was taken from Q [a hypothetical collection of sayings of Jesus], his most trustworthy source. He has sometimes been taken to task for emphasising the physical nature of the Resurrection since it is in his Gospel alone that the risen Jesus eats and drinks with his disciples. But here too he is simply reproducing with fidelity the sources on which he is relying. For in Acts 10.37-43 he puts into the mouth of Peter an almost credal utterance which is clearly derived from an Aramaic source and which represents the same picture of the Resurrection as we find in the Gospel.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>How accurate is accurate?</b><br><br>But how accurate are the four Gospels? For example, did Jesus ever actually say, "I am the Resurrection and the life" as is reported in John's Gospel? R.P.C.Hanson, a bishop, who also was a professor of Theology, once suggested it was an incredible thing to believe that Jesus actually said such words. But is there not confusion here?<br><br>Of course, few would believe that Jesus actually uttered the syllables "I am the Resurrection and the life". Most know that Jesus spoke neither in English nor always in the Greek of John's Gospel but often in Aramaic. But what many, including experts, would want to say is that Jesus said something somewhere in Palestine which through the agency of tradition and translation has come down to us in English as "I am the Resurrection and the life." And we will not be misled if we take this as the gist of what he taught.<br><br>We need to understand the nature of New Testament reporting. It followed its own conventions. The Gospel writers saw no problem in 'paraphrasing' or giving the 'gist' of someone's speech and then putting it as direct speech (they would have put this between inverted commas if they'd been invented as we now do; but there were none in the original). R.T.France, formerly Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, comments: "The use of inverted commas in [our] translations of the Gospels may lead us to expect, on the basis of our own conventions in reporting speech, a degree of verbatim accuracy which the writer did not intend. So many of the sayings which the Gospels introduce with 'Jesus said' may in fact be paraphrases. But that does not mean they are inventions." Someone once said the Evangelists are intending "to report accurately the substance of Jesus' teaching in meaningful terms to their readers, not to record his precise words in every instance." It is, however, accurate enough. And Jesus himself, of course, promised that the Holy Spirit would enable his disciples to remember what he had taught (John 14.26). So that is why today at the end of the twentieth century we can, and must, trust these apostolic reports from the Gospel writers.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="'The Imitation of Christ" (Modernized with Introduction)">(May 1998) "The Imitation of Christ" (Modernized with Introduction)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 1998</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>For some time I have taken to heart C.S.Lewis' comment in his essay On the Reading of Old Books. He argues that old books help you see what is fundamental in the Christian faith and what is a peripheral or even wrong.<br><br>"The only safety" he says ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... is to have a standard of plain, central Christianity ("mere Christianity" as Baxter called it) which puts the controversies of the moment in their proper perspective. Such a standard can be acquired only from the old books.</div></blockquote>

<p>So he then went on to say:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between. If that is too much for you, you should at least read one old one to every three new ones.</div></blockquote>

<p>Currently there is an encouraging trend for publishers to produce miniature or "pocket" books of the old Christian classics - these contain edited excerpts.<br><br>One very famous "old book" that I have not yet seen "excerpted" is the Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis. Over the centuries this has had a profound influence on a very wide range of people, from Thomas More to John Wesley to General Gordon. This Coloured Supplement contains, modernized, the first seven "chapters" of this work as a taster.<br><br>Thomas à Kempis (so called after his place of birth, Kempen, near Düsseldorf, Germany) was born in 1380 and died in 1471. He spent most of his life in a monastery where he worked as a copyist. It is said he copied out, by hand, the bible four times! His pre-Reformation sacramental teaching has not been acceptable to many Protestants; and so a number may not have read his writings. But his devotion to Christ, his desire for fellowship with him, and his teaching on biblical piety have been an inspiration to many others.<br><br>It was the great Protestant Bishop Ryle who taught that we should assume "fallibility" in all Christian ministers. In his essay The Fallibility of Ministers he says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Who does not see, when he reads the history of the Church of Christ, repeated proofs that the best of men can err? The early fathers were zealous according to their knowledge, and ready to die for Christ. But many of them countenanced monkery, and nearly all sowed the seeds of many superstitions. The Reformers were honoured instruments in the hand of God for reviving the cause of truth on earth. Yet hardly one of them can be named who did not make some great mistake ... The Puritans in after times, denounced toleration ... Wesley and Toplady abused each other in most shameful language.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ryle's thesis is clear - infallibility is not to be found in godly ministers, but in the Bible alone. That is still so important. It means two things. On the one hand, we should never follow respected Christian leaders when they go against the plain meaning of the bible (thus proving that they indeed are fallible). On the other hand, because they are wrong at certain points, we do not have to reject all they say and teach. It is in that spirit we ought to read Thomas à Kempis. He has so much to teach us. What follows, then, are the first seven "chapters" of The Imitation of Christ (modernized).<br><br>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><br><b>On the Imitation of Christ</b><br><br>1) Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, says the Lord (Jn 8.12). These are the words of Christ that encourage us to imitate his life and behaviour, if we want to be truly enlightened and delivered from all blindness of heart. May therefore our chief ambition be to meditate on the life of JESUS CHRIST.<br><br>The doctrine of Christ surpasses all the doctrines of holy men. The one who has the Spirit will find in it the hidden manna. (Rev 2.17). But it happens that many who often hear the Gospel of Christ feel little desire for it because they do not have the Spirit of Christ (Rom 8.9). But whoever wants to thrill at fully understanding the words of Christ must strive to conform their life wholly to the life of Christ.<br><br>2) What does it benefit you to talk profoundly about the Trinity, if you are lacking humility and so are displeasing to the Trinity? Surely profound words do not make a person holy and just. A virtuous life makes them dear to God. I had rather feel contrition than know its definition. If you knew the whole Bible by heart and the sayings of all the philosophers, what would all that profit you without the love of God (1 Cor 13.2) and without his grace?<br><br>Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless (Eccles 1.2) except to love God and to serve him alone. This is the highest wisdom - despising the world to press forward towards the heavenly kingdom.<br><br>It is therefore folly to seek riches that perish and to trust in them. It is also folly to search for honours and to climb to a high position. It is folly to follow the desires of the flesh and to long for what must later lead to grievous punishment. It is folly to wish to live long and to be careless about living well. It is folly to set your love on what speedily passes away and not to hasten onwards to where everlasting joy abides.<br><br>Call often to mind the proverb, The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing (Eccles 1.8). Strive therefore to withdraw your heart from the love of visible things. Turn yourself to things invisible. For those who follow their own sensuality defile their conscience and lose the grace of God.<br><br><br><b>On personal humility</b><br><br>1) Everyone naturally desires knowledge (Eccles 1.13). But what does knowledge benefit without the fear of God? Better, surely, is a humble labourer who serves God, than a proud philosopher that, neglecting his soul, studies the courses of the stars. Whoever truly knows themself, loses their pride and does not delight in the praises of others. If I understood all things in the world and lacked love (1 Cor 13.2), what would that help me in the sight of God who will judge me according to my deeds?<br><br>Cease having an inordinate desire for knowledge, for in that is found a great distraction and deception. The learned are well pleased to be seen as such by others and to be accounted wise. There are many things that if you know them will profit your soul little or nothing. A person is very unwise who is devoted to anything except that which leads to their salvation. Many words do not satisfy the soul. But a good life comforts the mind and a pure conscience gives great confidence towards God.<br><br>The more, and the better, is your knowledge, so much the more rigorously will you be judged, unless your life has been the more holy. Do not therefore boast of any art or science, but rather fear for the knowledge you have.<br><br>2) If you think that you know many things and understand them very well, know also that there are far more things you do not know. Do not be conceited (Rom 12.16), but rather acknowledge your own ignorance. Why do you put yourself before another, since there are many more learned and more skilful in the Law than your are? If you will know or learn any thing with real profit, love to be unknown and to be reckoned as nothing.<br><br>The deepest and most profitable lesson is this, the true knowledge and low estimate of ourselves. It is great wisdom and high perfection to reckon nothing of ourselves and to think always well and highly of others. If you should see another openly sin or commit some serious crime, you ought not to think better of yourself. You do not know how long you will be able to remain in a good state. All of us are frail (Gen 8.21), but you ought to reckon none more frail than yourself.<br><br><br><b>On the teaching of Truth</b><br><br>1) Happy is the person whom Truth itself teaches (Ps 94.12) not by signs and words that pass away, but as it is in itself. Our own opinions and our own views often deceive us and they tell us little.<br><br>What value is a great controversy and dispute about obscure and hidden things (Eccles 3.9-11)? We will not be reproved at the judgement day because we do not understand them. It is a great folly to neglect the things that are profitable and necessary, while giving our minds to things that are interesting but harmful. Do we have eyes, but fail to see (Ps 115.5; Mk 8.18)? What do we have to do with "genus" and "species"? The person to whom the Eternal Word speaks is set free from much speculation. From that one Word are all things, and all things tell of him. The Author of all is the one who speaks to us. No one without him understands or judges rightly. The person to whom all things are one and who relates all things to one and sees all things in one, is able to be steadfast in heart, and remain at peace with God.<br><br>O God, who are the truth, make me one with you in continual love. I am weary with much reading and with hearing many things. In you is all that I desire and long for. Let all teachers hold their peace. Let all creatures be silent in your sight. Speak to me, you alone.<br><br>2) The more a person is at one within themself and becomes single in heart, so much the more do they understand profound things and without effort. They receive the light of understanding from above ( Mat 11.25; Lk 10. 21). A pure, sincere, and stable spirit is not distracted by a multitude of works, for it works everything for the honour of God; and inwardly it strives to be at rest from all self-seeking. What hinders and troubles you more than the unmortified passions of your own heart? A good and devout person decides within themself beforehand what they are going to do in the world. Nor does this lead them along the lines of the desires of their sinful inclination, but they order them in line with the decision of sound judgment. Who has a harder struggle than the one who strives to conquer himself? This ought to be our aim, to conquer ourselves and daily to grow stronger than ourselves and to make some progress for good.<br><br>3) All perfection in this life has some imperfection bound up with it; and no knowledge of ours is without some obscurity. A humble knowledge of yourself is a surer way to God than a deep search after learning. Yet learning is not to be blamed nor the mere knowledge of anything. Knowledge considered by itself is good and ordained by God. But a good conscience and a virtuous life are always to be preferred to it. Since many aim rather to know than to live well, that is why they are often deceived and reap no, or very little, fruit.<br><br>O, if people bestowed as much labour in the rooting out of vices and planting of virtues as they do in devising questions, there would neither be so great evils and scandals in the world, nor so much looseness in religious houses.<br><br>Truly, when the day of judgment comes, we shall not be examined for what we have read, but for what we have done (Mat 25); not for how well we have spoken, but for how religiously we have lived.<br><br>Tell me, where now are all those Masters and Doctors with whom you were well acquainted while they were alive and who were famous for learning? Others have now taken their places and perhaps scarcely ever think of them. In their lifetime they seemed to be famous but now they are not spoken of. O, how quickly the glory of the world (Eccles 2.11) passes away!<br><br>O that their lives had been as good as their learning! Then their study and reading would have been to good purpose. How many perish in this world by reason of deceptive learning (Tit 1.10) and take little care of serving God. Because they choose to be great rather than humble, therefore they come to nothing in their thinking (Rom 1.21).<br><br>The man is truly great who is great in love. The man is truly great that is humble in himself and does not work for the highest honours (Mat 18.4; 23.11). The man is truly wise who considers all earthly things as rubbish, that he may gain Christ (Phil 3.8). And the man is truly very learned who does the will of God and ignores his own will.<br><br><br><b>On prudence in action</b><br><br>1) We ought not to believe every utterance or suggestion (1 Jn 4.1), but ought cautiously and patiently ponder words with reference to God. But alas! such is our weakness that we often rather believe and speak evil of others than good. Those who are perfect do not easily give credit to every tale; they know that human weakness is prone to evil (Gen 8.21) and often tempted to deceive (James 3.2).<br><br>2) It is great wisdom not to be rash in your actions (Prov 19.2), nor to cling obstinately to your own opinions. It is also part of that same wisdom not to believe every thing that you hear, nor to pour immediately what you have heard or believed into the ears of others (Prov 17.9). Consult a man who is wise and conscientious, and seek to be instructed by someone better than yourself rather than follow your own ideas (Prov 12.15).<br><br>A good life makes a man wise according to God's will (Prov 15.33) and gives him wide experience (Eccles 1.16). The more humble a man is in himself and the more submitted to God, the more prudent will he be in everything and the more at peace.<br><br><br><b>On reading the Bible</b><br><br>1) Truth is to be sought in the Bible, not in clever words. Every part of the Bible ought to be read with the same Spirit by which it was written (Rom 15.4). We should seek spiritual benefit in the Bible rather than elegant writing.<br><br>2) We ought to read as readily devout and simple books as the heavy and complicated ones. Let not the reputation of the writer affect you, whether his learning is great or small. But let the love of pure truth draw you to read (1 Cor 2.4). Do not ask "who said this or that?" but mark what is said. Men pass away, but the faithfulness of the Lord endures for ever (Ps 117.2; Lk 21.33). God speaks to us in different ways and is no respecter of persons (Rom 2.11; 10.12; Col 3.11).<br><br>3) Our own curiosity often hinders us in reading the Bible. We desire to understand and dispute matters we should simply pass over. If you desire to be profited, read with humility, simplicity, and faith. Do not ever desire a reputation for scholarship. Be willing to ask questions, and hear with silence the teaching of mature Christians. Do not be irritated by the repeated words of older men. They are not recounted without good cause (Prov 1.6; Eccles 12.9).<br><br><br><b>On control of the desires</b><br><br>1) Whenever a man desires any thing inordinately, he is immediately in turmoil. A proud and covetous person is never at rest. The poor and humble in spirit enjoy great peace (Ps 37.11).<br><br>2) The one that is not yet perfectly dead to self, is quickly tempted and is overcome in small and trifling things. The weak in spirit and the one still prey to earthly and sensual passions, can only with difficulty free themself from worldly desires. So they are often sad when they have to give them up; and they easily are angry with any who oppose them. If they gain what they have desired, they are immediately burdened with remorse in their conscience; for they followed their own passion, which in no way helped them obtain the peace they sought.<br><br>3) True peace of heart therefore is found by resisting our desires, not by obeying them. So there is no peace in the heart of a sensual person, nor in the one given up to worldly things, but in the one who is fervent and spiritual.<br><br><br><b>On avoiding vain hope and pride</b><br><br>1) Foolish is the one who sets his hope in man (Jer 17.5) or in any creature. Do not be ashamed to serve others for the love of Jesus Christ, nor to be reckoned poor in this world.<br><br>Do not rely on yourself but put your hope in God (Ps 31.1). Do what lies in your power and God will assist your good intention.<br><br>Do not trust in your own knowledge nor in the cleverness of any living person. Rather trust in the grace of God, who helps the humble and humbles those that are proud (1 Pet 5.5).<br><br>2) Do not glory in wealth if you have it, nor in friends because they are powerful. Glory in God who gives all things and above all desires to give you himself.<br><br>Do not extol yourself for your physical prowess or beauty which a little sickness can disfigure and destroy.<br><br>Take no pleasure in your natural gifts or talents, lest in doing so you displease God to whom belongs all the good and whatever you have by nature.<br><br>Do not reckon yourself better than others (Ex 3.11). Perhaps in the sight of God, who knows what is in man, you are accounted worse. Do not be proud of good works (Job 9.20). The judgments of God are different from the judgments of men and what pleases men often offends him. If you have any good qualities, believe others are better so that you may keep humble. It does you no harm to set yourself lower than all others. But it harms you exceedingly if you set yourself above even one person. Lasting peace is with the humble; but the heart of the proud is full of envy and, often, jealousy.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Where are we Leading - is there a Crisis?">(June 1998) Where are we Leading - is there a Crisis?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 1998</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The international scenario</b><br><br>Just before he died in 1976, André Malraux the French novelist and politician said, "The twenty-first century will be religious or it will not be at all." That is a rather cryptic but, I believe, important remark.<br><br>Richard Neuhaus, the ex-Lutheran Roman Catholic sociologist has this view of the future:</p>

<blockquote><div>At the threshold to the Third Millennium, it seems that the alternatives to religion have exhausted themselves. That is true of the materialistically cramped rationalisms of the Enlightenment encyclopaedists, which along with ideological utopianisms, both romantic and allegedly scientific, have been consigned, as Marxists used to say, to the dustbin of history. The perversity of the human mind will no doubt produce other ideological madnesses, but at the moment it seems the historical stage has been swept clean, with only the religious proposition left standing.</div></blockquote>

<p>And in a similar vein, the distinguished Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington has written a major work on the future entitled, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. Henry Kissinger calls this "one of the most important books to have emerged since the end of the Cold War". Huntington's thesis is that world affairs in the 19th century were chiefly determined by the nation-state; in the 20th century by ideology; but in the next century, the 21st century, they will be dominated by the conflict of civilizations, with civilizations being typically defined by cultures and cultures defined by religion. So the collapse of communism does not point toward the world-wide embrace of democratic capitalism and Western values and vices. Rather he sees an era of conflict that will be deep-seated and endemic. And the West will be at a great disadvantage, with its Christian culture having disintegrated under an elitist imposition of a non-cohesive pluralism. "Peoples and countries with similar cultures are coming together," writes Huntington. "Peoples and countries with different cultures are coming apart."<br><br>Who can deny that? You only have to look at Bosnia; and there it is quite frightening. His thesis is that culture is eclipsing both nationalism and ideology as the nexus of politics. And at the heart of culture, argues Huntington, is religion.</p>

<blockquote><div>In the modern world religion is a central, perhaps the central force that motivates and mobilizes people.</div></blockquote>

<p>And the eight distinctive civilizations, according to Huntington, are: Islamic, Sinic (with China the core), the West (with the US the core), Orthodox (with Russia the core), Japanese, Hindu, Latin American and African. The "most dangerous clashes of the future," he writes, are "likely to arise from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic intolerance, and Sinic assertiveness." <br><br><br><b>Nearer home</b><br><br>So much for the international scene. What about the future of society in the UK? If this world-wide scenario is correct, there will be a significant process of desecularization. There will be a new consciousness regarding culture and religion. This will reduce the significance of what is currently understood as the "political" and the "structural" and heighten the importance of the "cultural" and the "religious". David Martin, the English sociologist, seems to echo this new analysis in his recent study, Forbidden Revolutions. He argues against the "misleading polarity ... between culture and structure, where the former is seen as derivative and passive and the latter as the arena of effective power and political action." His point is this. Religion and culture (and so we may add, personal behaviour and belief) for the past hundred years have been progressively considered marginal and part of people's private lives. The real action of life, it is said, takes place in "the structures" and so in "the politics of society." But what we have seen in the second half of this century is a contradiction. The cultural and religious margins around the world have changed the so-called centre and structures - certainly in Latin America and Eastern Europe.<br><br>I believe Martin is correct. Structures are subordinate. Beliefs are primary. That has huge implications not just for our national corporate life but for institutional churches. At the end of the day biblical and apostolic belief, prayer and straightforward evangelism - bringing men and women to faith in Christ are central with the structures (such as synodical life) marginal. That brings me to the Church of England. And I submit there is a crisis.<br><br>In the UK we are witnessing spiritual degeneration. There is decline in numbers of attenders at church. In the Church of England the decline in terms of Sunday attendances is about 1 per cent per year. That is not huge, but it is inexorable. Over the eleven year period from 1984 (the year David Jenkins was consecrated bishop) to 1995 the usual Sunday attendances in Anglican Churches went down from 1,182,000 to 1,045,000 ( a 12 percent decline). Only about 2 per cent of the population are now in an Anglican church on any given Sunday (with 10 percent plus in church overall). Nor is the situation better in the other denominations or House Churches.<br><br>But we must not confuse beliefs and commitments with the institutional expression of those beliefs and commitments. For what continues to be significant is the overall self-identification of the people of Britain. According to the last Independent Television Commission's survey, Seeing is Believing, just over 72 per cent of the population identify themselves as Christian. Only 3 percent are of other faiths. Just over 22 per cent are nothing. That 3 percent of other faiths, incidentally, shows we are not a pluralist, multifaith country in reality. That is a myth of educationalists, broadcasters, and some print journalists who are over represented by that 22 percent who believe nothing.<br><br><br><b>Assumptions</b><br><br>Let me now make three assumptions. First, if we want to be true to the tradition of the bible and the apostles we need to be committed to the Western Reformed Catholic tradition of the Christian faith (that is the tradition of Augustine, Luther, Calvin, the English Reformers, the Evangelical leaders of the 18th century, men like Simeon, Ryle and Spurgeon in the last century and what we call mainstream evangelicalism in the 20th century). Secondly, we are in the Church of England because its formulas and history have, until now, upheld that Western Reformed Catholic tradition. Thirdly, we are concerned for the evangelisation of the nation. With those assumptions, let me now talk about the interface of public life and the Church of England. That is best seen in the self-identification of our citizens as revealed by opinion polls.<br><br>A Gallup survey from 1982 and published by the Bible Society in 1983 found that 64 percent identified with the Church of England. In the 1987 survey from the old IBA's (the Independent Broadcasting Authority's) religious department, published as God Watching, the figure was 50 percent. In this latest broadcasting survey from the new ITC in 1993 (that I have already referred to) the figure is 40 percent identifying as Anglican. And a 1996 survey published in British Social Attitudes (13th Report) shows 30 percent. That is a decline in people's self-perception as Anglican of 10 percent every few years. In the year 2010 we could expect 10 percent of the population to claim to be Anglican, and by the year 2020 the sense of belonging might be limited to the tiny percentage who attend regularly. That would be very serious. For then in no way would the Church of England be the church of the nation. It would be irrelevant whether there were, or were not, bishops in the House of Lords. In terms of social strength the church would be a mere "sect". For many of us that would create great problems.<br><br><br><b>The "magisterial" Reformation</b><br><br>Let me explain. I expect I speak for many of us when I say we, as Anglican evangelicals, are committed to what is called the "magisterial" Reformation [magister is the Latin for "ruler"]. Unlike the more radical Reformers who wanted to establish Christian ghettos of pure churches, the magisterial Reformers like Luther, Calvin, Cranmer and the other great English Reformers of the Church of England (including Hooker) wanted the gospel to relate to the wider realities of life - the secular (or in their jargon "the temporal") as well as the spiritual. We believe our task is to share the gospel with the citizens in our nation who live in our areas. So if in the year 2020 the shell that some would call the "Church of England" is simply a tiny sect and if present trends continue it becomes also a theologically liberal sect, will it be appropriate to be fully identified with that shell? That shell would not be significantly part of the Western Reformed Catholic tradition. It would have lost the gospel; it would have lost its "magisterial" significance; and it would not in a meaningful sense be the biblical church that was defined by our Reformers, by the Thirty-Nine Articles, by the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, by the Ordinal, and by the Church of England (Worship and Doctrine Measure) 1974.<br><br>In practical terms that shell, or the structured Church of England, would be rather like the current Orthodox Church in, say, Romania. There you have elegant buildings - but not very well-kept. And very few attend - bar a handful of elderly people. In England under such a hypothetical scenario, this Church of England shell would survive. It would, however, be of historical rather than spiritual interest to the majority of our citizens. The clergy would be glorified vergers taking a service from whatever politically correct prayer book was then in fashion in a side chapel for any who attended.<br><br><br><b>"Black and white" facts</b><br><br>You say, "this is all opinion polls and surveys. This is scare-mongering." Let me assure you that it is for real! Take the official infant baptism figures available from the latest edition of the CBF's official 1997 Church Statistics. These are "black and white" and matters of fact, not "opinion" or prediction. The loss of the pull of the Church of England is mirrored in our infant baptism figures.<br><br>In 1950 67 percent of all babies in England were baptised in the Church of England. That means that only 33 percent were not so baptised. These people are now 47 years old. That is to say, the great majority of 47 year olds today (and people who are older) were baptised Anglican. <br><br>In 1960 55 percent of all babies were baptised in the Church of England. That means 45 percent weren't so baptised. These people are now 36 years old. That is to say, of all current 36 year olds more than half were baptised in an Anglican church.<br><br>In 1970 it was 47 percent, with 53 percent not being baptised. These people are now 26 years old. Of that age group it is now less than half who were baptised in an Anglican church.<br><br>In 1980 it was 36 percent, with 64 percent not being baptised Anglican. These people are now 16 years old and will be 40 in 2020. So in 2020 two thirds of the population who are 40 will not have been baptized as Anglicans.<br><br>In 1990 it was 27 percent, with 73 percent not being baptised as Anglican. These people are now 6 years old, and will be 30 in the year 2020. The latest figures for 1995 are 24 percent, with 76 percent not being baptised Anglican. That is a huge difference from 1950 when it was 67 percent baptised and only 33 percent not. So in the year 2020 the vast majority of 25 year olds - in fact over three-quarters - are unlikely to feel any personal attachment to the Church of England. I trust the point is made. And it is simply fact. It is no good burying your head in the sand. Unless something happens, the Church of England as we know it will be marginalised as far as our public culture is concerned. The process of marginalisation is under way. It is for some of us to take action. But, remember, people are still identifying as Christian - 72 percent of them according to that Independent Television Commission survey. No doubt that will be lower if things continue as they are in 2020, but not necessarily hugely lower. So what is happening?<br><br>One thing that is happening is this: we are now in a period of post-denominationalism. People born after 1960 do not chose a church because of the denominational label. They are in a church either because that is where they were converted, or because the music is good, the preaching is good, the crèche is good, the youth work is good, the small group system is good or something else is good.<br><br><br><b>The denominations</b><br><br>Denominations as we know them are probably going to become things of the past. At the time of the Elizabethan Settlement there were no denominations. In terms of its social structure the Church of England was evolving into a federation of churches linked or "connected" together by the crown, the episcopate, a prayer book and the Articles. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 and the ejection of 2000 presbyterian ministers from their livings meant that by the beginning of the 18th century denominations would inevitably have evolved. The Act of Toleration of 1689, at the accession of William and Mary, saw their formal beginning. Originally they too were federations of churches linked or "connected" by whatever made them distinctive - presbyteries, independency, baptismal practice, or the Quaker ethic.<br><br>However, in the 19th century, with the growth of evangelicalism and the missionary movements, there was a change. The denominations became "corporations" rather than "federations". That is to say, they operated "corporately" together for joint activities. So there were the Baptist Missionary Society, the Methodist Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society and the like. There were also other agencies for moral and social welfare work and for education. And this form - the denomination as a "corporation" where a central agency acted on behalf of the whole denomination (or that part of it that had an interest) - lasted until the 1960s.<br><br>Because of the growth of denominational activity in the 19th century - by the denominations acting as corporations - there were inevitably clashes, and the wrong sort of competition, especially on the mission field. This led to the famous Edinburgh World Missionary Conference of 1910. It aimed to set forward world-evangelization. It's main achievement was the beginning of the ecumenical movement and what became the World Council of Churches. But far from lessening the denominational distinctives the ecumenical movement gave encouragement to a new denominational self-consciousness. By the 1950's and early 1960's you probably had the high-point of denominationalism, with people paying a huge attention to "their denomination" and arguing that sound ecclesiology was "the one thing necessary". It is, of course, at this time that many in the recent and current leadership of the Church of England were in training and being formed in ministerial norms and ideals - people like George Carey and Pat Harris, and also lesser clergy like many of us, myself included. These people were, and are, thoroughly denominational. And today they find it difficult to think in terms other than those of "the denomination" when they think about "the Church". In the Church of England this was the period of Canon Law revision and the debates about the setting up of synodical government.<br><br><br><b>The 1960's</b><br><br>However, at the same time in the 1960's something else was happening. This was the time of extreme liberal and permissive theology centred (in England) at Cambridge and the Southbank of the Thames in Southwark. John Robinson was the most famous name of these "new theologians" with his book Honest to God. This denied much biblical truth and validated a new morality. Harry Williams, the Dean at Trinity College, Cambridge (and so college chaplain to Prince Charles) argued that if sex outside marriage helped you psychologically that must be Christ's will. By the end of the decade Paul Altizer was arguing that God is Dead.<br><br>Michael Ramsey was now Archbishop of Canterbury. In part the present erosion of the Church goes back to him. A brilliant and apparently godly man, he was among the first, in a high profile position, to espouse the principle of affirming truth without denying error. He would not condemn heresy, while being personally, and often helpfully, orthodox. One of the great gurus who influenced and under-girded this new "comprehensiveness" of Ramsey was F.D.Maurice. But this comprehensiveness was new in the Anglican tradition. Hooker would only have comprehensiveness in matters of church order, never in matters of fundamental doctrine. There had always been latitudinarianism - but nothing like the "anything goes" Ramsey tolerated.<br><br>At this time, in the words of the former Dean of Salisbury, Fenton Morley, "the heart was taken out of the Church of England"; and indeed there were parallels in the other denominations. These radical theological innovations meant the evaporation of the old consensus from which the denominations "as corporations" could work on behalf of those they represented. No longer could the denominations work as corporations.<br><br>So now the denominations had to change into something else. And they did so. From being federations and then being corporations, the denominations - and this was true of most of them, not just the Church of England - now became "regulatory agencies". This meant they became more centralised and saw their function mainly as holding budgets and telling people what they could and could not do. The result of this change to becoming regulatory agencies has been a significant denominational break down.<br><br><br><b>Denominational breakdown</b><br><br>The churches are "voluntary non-profit organizations". They are not "non-voluntary non-profit organizations" like Government departments and Local Authorities that have penal sanctions to enforce action. Nor are they "voluntary for-profit organizations" like businesses that have financial power to enforce action. Being "voluntary non-profit organizations" they have no sanctions and no power - certainly as far as the laity is concerned. Motivation is everything.<br><br>But the new denominations - or the denominations in their new form - cannot motivate. Laymen who are bible-believing and can administer multi-million (even billion) pound companies, or perform sophisticated surgical operations, or lead modern educational institutions, do not take kindly to less than brilliant clergy (even if they are bishops or moderators) or to clericalised laymen telling them, from denominational headquarters, what to believe or how much to give in support of causes they disapprove of.<br><br>This has led to the denominations becoming quite dysfunctional. With the erosion of the consensus their future is secured only so long as there are certain functions they still control and that the clergy are dependent on. This is fundamentally matters of stipend and pension - hence the near panic at the centre at quota-capping or the suggestion that the local congregation should be formally responsible, as it once was, for stipend and pension, or, indeed, buildings.<br><br>In the aftermath of the denominational high point of the 60s, while the pervasive church consciousness was still very "denominational", there was massive centralization taking place. Synodical Government facilitated this process. In particular it related to stipends in the Church of England with the setting up of the Central Stipends Authority in the 1970s, initially on the grounds that this would be more convenient for everyone. But with the devaluation of central subsidies, de facto if not de jure these payments are once again the responsibility of the local congregation. Before long, certainly in the Church of England, pensions will also be the responsibility of the local congregation. At that point what will be the function of the centre? Many would say "for training the next generation of ministers."<br><br>But that training itself is now dysfunctional. Originally, ordination training was pluralistic. In the Church of England in the last century and until the second world war, it had operated as a "free market". This was particularly because the different traditions - anglo-catholic and evangelical - insisted on training their own men in their own way. And in output terms, it was successful. Now numbers are low, not least because young men (and women) have lost confidence in the way the denominational churches are evolving. But is not all this too pessimistic a picture?<br><br><br><b>Pannenberg and Willimon</b><br><br>Let me quote to you from the distinguished German theologian, Wolfhart Pannenberg, to prove that this analysis is not unique:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is quite possible that in the early part of the 3rd millennium, only the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches, on the one hand, and Evangelical Protestantism, on the other, will survive as ecclesial communions. What used to be called the Protestant Mainline Churches are in acute danger of disappearing. I expect they will disappear if they continue neither to resist the Spirit of a progressively secularist culture nor to try to transform it.</div></blockquote>

<p>Here is the American William Willimon, dean of chapel and professor of Christian ministry at Duke University:</p>

<blockquote><div>One of the big stories we are witnessing is the dismantling of national denominations. We have been slashing national staffs due to huge budgetary problems. Some of our concern about the national denominations will dissipate due to this dismantling of bureaucracies. We're seeing a move to the local, to the congregational ... We've seen the end of denominationalism as we know it, although not the end of some kind of chastened denominationalism. It may be a stripping down for service. I don't meet any young adults interested in feeding national organizations.</div></blockquote>

<p>So what do we do?<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>First we must face the facts. Then positively at a structural level, among other things I believe we must see in the West the rise in urban areas of many large, seven-day-a-week churches, that can provide a range of ministries adequate to modern needs. That will mean teams of leaders working from one base. David Martin writes:<br><br>At the cutting edge of modernity the megacity may well be complemented by the megachurch, which (in the range of functions it includes) almost harbingers a return to the medieval Church. Megachurches are emerging in Latin America as well as in North America (and Korea) and are even to be found in Eastern Europe. Only Western Europe so far lacks them.<br><br>But large or small we must all structure for growth. Our concern will not be to keep other clergy happy but saving souls. Where there is heresy we must note what ECUSA Evangelicals have recently said:<br><br>We will not be bound, in the exercise of our presbyteral or diaconal ministries, by the legal or geographical boundaries of any parish or diocese, if those boundaries are being invoked to prevent the preaching and teaching of "the doctrine, discipline, and worship of Christ as this Church has received them" [that is a quote from the American Ordinal].<br><br>Then at a theological level, I believe we need to recover the biblical doctrine of sin. It was Ryle who said: "dim or indistinct views of sin are the origin of most of the errors, heresies, and false doctrines." And there must be firm action against heresy. Bishop Spong is publishing a new book that denies the incarnation. Reform, not unreasonably, has asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to disinvite Spong and his co-signatories of the Koinonia Statement from Lambeth - without success, so far. Nor must we be intimidated by the word schism. As Hooker said, "what they call schism we call our reasonable service unto God." <br><br>At a pastoral level I believe we need - all of us as church leaders - to heed Paul's words in Colossians 1.28-29:</p>

<blockquote><div>We proclaim him [that is Jesus], admonishing [that is saying things are wrong when they are wrong] and teaching everyone with all wisdom [not some], so that we may present everyone perfect [or, 'mature'] in Christ. 29 To this end I labour [that means hard work], struggling [that means conflict, but it is] with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ever since I heard John Stott expound that verse on his 50th birthday, I have made that my own person philosophy of ministry.<br><br>And at an evangelistic level, we need to heed Paul's words to Timothy (2 Tim 4.1-5):</p>

<blockquote><div>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 2 Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction. 3 For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</div></blockquote>

<p>And above all we must pray - that God's will is done.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Genesis 3 and the Fall">(July 1998) Genesis 3 and the Fall</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>July 1998</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>I want to begin tonight by giving you the words of a Christian scholar. He is writing on these opening chapters of Genesis that you are studying this term. Let me quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>Natural scientists and philosophers have attempted to explain nature or the world; but not one of their theories or suggestions has remained firm or unshaken; each has been over thrown by its successor ... Those for whom the concept of "God" is meaningless are unwilling to admit that a rational being was in control at the inception of the Universe ... Take the "materialists" - those who say matter is all there is, matter is ultimate, or put more technically, atoms, molecules etc (invisible entities) coalescing make up the visible world. It is because they don't know how to say, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Gen 1.1). An atheistic philosophy of the world has misled them; and it appears then that nothing governs or rules the Universe, but all is given up to mere chance.</div></blockquote>

<p>To guard us from such an error the writer of the creation narrative in Genesis, with his very first words, flashes into our minds the name of God. "In the beginning God created". What a glorious order. He first establishes a beginning. Then he adds "created" to show that what was made was a very small part of the power of the creator.<br><br>This is not from someone in the 19th or 20th centuries writing against Darwin or modern views of Genesis. This was written in the 4th century (AD) by Basil of Cappadocia.<br><br>It is all too easy to think that we are the first people to have difficulties regarding the bible and the origins of things; and that we are the first people to see the issues. Of course, some things change; but the fundamental problems remain exactly the same throughout all the generations. Christians down the centuries have realised you have to respect the language of Genesis. And Genesis 1-3 is clearly not like the Acts of the Apostles.<br><br><br><b>James Orr and the Pope</b><br><br>Here is the great Scottish theologian, Professor James Orr (one of the original "fundamentalists" - that is to say a contributor to the scholarly series of essays called The Fundamentals that were published earlier this century - and from which the word "fundamentalism" has come). He writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>The creation of the world was certainly not a myth, but a fact ... The language used was not that of modern science, but, under divine guidance, the sacred writer gives a broad, general picture which conveys a true idea of the order of the divine working in creation. Man's fall was likewise a tremendous fact, with universal consequences in sin and death to the race. Man's origin can only be explained through an exercise of direct creative activity, whatever subordinate factors evolution may have contributed.</div></blockquote>

<p>And he says, chapter 3 of Genesis (our chapter for tonight) is ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... very probably an old tradition clothed with an oriental allegory.</div></blockquote>

<p>But he said:</p>

<blockquote><div>The truth incorporated in the narrative, the fall of man from an original state of purity, I consider vital for the Christian vision.</div></blockquote>

<p>Then half way through this century and from an altogether different tradition, Pope Pius XII spoke of the early chapters of Genesis in Humani Generis:</p>

<blockquote><div>Although it is not right to judge them by modern standards of historical composition, such as would be applied to the great classical authors, or to the learned of our own day, they do nevertheless come under the heading of history ... These chapters have a naïve, symbolical way of talking, well suited to the understanding of a primitive people. But they do disclose to us certain important truths.</div></blockquote>

<p>So much by way of introduction.<br><br><br><b>A philosophy of history</b><br><br>Our subject tonight is Sin and the Fall.<br><br>And we shall look at chapter 2 verses 15-17 where God told the man what he may eat and may not eat; and chapter 3, where the woman and then the man disobeyed; and where we read of the sad consequences. This is all about Adam and Eve and what they did.<br><br>As many of you know, the word "man" is "Adam" in the original. Adam means simply "man". So it is right to see "Adam" as not only the first man, but also, as he became after the fall, the "typical" man. Each of us as we study this account can learn something about "everyman" and "everywoman", and so about ourselves. Many people feel satisfied when they have done that. And we shall do that tonight. But we must not forget that the narrative in Genesis is clearly talking about the first man (and woman). There may be figurative and symbolic elements in the text, as Christians down the centuries have realised. But as Henri Blocher in his excellent IVP book In the Beginning argues:</p>

<blockquote><div>the presence of symbolic elements in the text in no way contradicts the historicity of its central meaning ... the real problem is not to know if we have a historical account of the fall, but an account of a historical fall.</div></blockquote>

<p>So we can't just treat these chapters as an existential account of how the world always is. No! they are talking about what happened in the past. And this is absolutely vital. Let me explain.<br><br>What you have in the bible is nothing if it is not a "philosophy of history". It tells you the real story of what has been going on in the world. It tells you a lot else as well. But fundamentally this is a philosophy of history. It provides a panorama from Genesis to Revelation - from the beginning to the end of history. And the stage is set by Genesis for the whole bible. And it is vital we get the message Genesis is giving.<br><br><br><b>Four essentials</b><br><br>Let me outline four essentials of that message - (I apologize if this is to recap from previous weeks; but some of you may not have been to earlier studies). These four essentials are all implied in these early chapters of Genesis.<br><br>First, history is linear, not cyclical.<br><br>Some of the Eastern religions and some of the Greeks believed that time or history is like a great wheel that keeps returning on itself. But the bible makes it clear that history had a beginning and it will have an end. It is linear. And there is a purpose to history.<br><br>The Old Testament gives you the introduction and Jesus is the climax. The first part of that climax was with his first coming, death, resurrection, ascension and giving of the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago. The finale will be his second coming at the end of history. So how do you talk about the beginning and the end? Take the end.<br><br>The bible establishes the fact of the end and then uses symbolism - trumpets, shouts, imperial visitations - for the second coming of Jesus; and it uses amazing picture language to talk of heaven and indeed hell. For things outside history (after its end) that is all that is open to you. In one sense it is beyond our imagination. But those symbols and pictures are God's way of communicating with us so that we sufficiently understand what will happen. Heaven is going to be wonderful. Hell is going to awful. Christ is coming; there will be a judgment. When it happens we will see how appropriate all the bible language has been. We ought therefore to expect the same symbolism with accounts of the beginning of time and history. And that is what you have got.<br><br>We are not talking about "myths" that do not refer to what happened. These chapters in Genesis are referring to what happened; in the same way as Jesus teaching about the end and the book of Revelation are referring to what will happen one day. So time and history is linear.<br><br>Secondly, Genesis tells you that nature is not ultimate. God is.<br><br>What is ultimate, that is to say, is not an "it" but a "he". One who is personal gave rise to what is impersonal. It is not the other way round.<br><br>Thirdly, - the third essential - man or the creation of the human male and female, is the high point of creation (as you saw in chapter 1, and as you saw in chapter 2 as well).<br><br>And fourthly, (and this brings us back to our passage for tonight), Genesis teaches that the fundamental problem facing the world is moral; it is rebelling against our great and good Creator. And obedience to God results in human well-being; disobedience in human disaster.<br><br>Every religion and every philosophy and even irreligious and unsophisticated people recognize the difference between "is" and "ought". The world as it "is", is clearly different from the world as it "ought" to be. Now there are different visions of the good life - what "ought" to be. But that gap between "is" and "ought" is there in every religion and every philosophy.<br><br>But how do you account for it and get over it? Pagan religion thinks that it is a matter of appeasing malign spirits. Eastern religions tend to think it is a question of eliminating desire or escaping from this physical existence into a spiritual state. Marx thought it was a matter of overcoming social alienation by revolution resulting in a classless society. Freud thought it was in overcoming the frustration of human appetite for sex, nutrition or power. Herbert Spencer, and many in the last century and even this century, thought it was simply a matter of evolution. They believed history or time is itself redemptive; the better, they said, is the more evolved. And so you can go on.<br><br>But Genesis is crystal clear. The problem is due to human rebellion against God. It is as simple and profound as that. The problem is due to sin. It is not due to the environment. That would be to say it is due to the creation itself. But Genesis teaches the creation is good.<br><br><br><b>The Fall</b><br><br>All this is why the doctrine of a historic Fall is so vital. If there is no fall "in time", the fallen state of the world must be due to the creation - what is external to men and women. And that is just the view of millions today. The problems, they say, are all located in the world outside the human will and outside the human soul. The problems are all external - in terms of poverty, or poor education, or poor employment opportunities, or in "the stuff" of human bodies - our genetic make-up. True, all these things are important and create greater temptations. <br><br>But the root problem, as we shall see, is not outside but inside - in the human heart. That is where all is wrong. So Jesus says (Mark 7:21-23):</p>

<blockquote><div>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22 greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23 All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.</div></blockquote>

<p>And sin disrupts the relationship between man and God. Get that wrong and you've got everything else wrong. If there is no sin, why need a Saviour? As so many have now lost the doctrine of sin, don't be surprised when they do not think that the cross is totally necessary; or that Jesus is the only way to God. But if sin is the problem, as Genesis teaches so clearly, then the world's need is fundamentally the need of salvation from sin and of a Saviour. And Jesus is the one person who has set foot on this planet who can deal with sin. That is why you have to evangelize. There is no other way; there is no other name given under heaven by which you must and can be saved.<br><br>So Genesis is setting the scene for the whole Bible. It is essential you get these messages. It is giving you this philosophy of history. And its importance is seen in the apostles' preaching. <br><br>When they preached to the Jews, they could assume people had this fundamental philosophy of history and they just talked about Jesus as the answer. When they preached to the Gentiles, (for example, Paul in Athens), they had to teach as well this philosophy of history by giving an out line - look at Acts 17.<br><br>Well so much for the broad sweep.<br><br><br><b>God's word and mankind</b><br><br>I now want to look in the rest of the time, fairly briefly, at some of the details of the text here - the details of God's word to Adam [and Eve] and their disobedience; and then the consequences. So, first, look back to chapter 2 15 - 17:</p>

<blockquote><div>The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.</div></blockquote>

<p>" What marks a man off from the rest of created beings? Here is the clue. And this, of course, is getting more and more to be an important question.<br><br>Our old cat had to be put to sleep earlier this year: it was very sickly. But the vet seemed to be treating the cat as though it were a human and spoke about us wanting "euthanasia". My wife, who is a doctor herself, was made to feel quite guilty because we were unwilling to use the whole panoply of modern veterinary medicine to extend its miserable life. The borderline between the human and the animal was being obscured. I found that quite sinister.<br><br>So what marks off a human being from an animal? Answer: it is with "the man" alone that God speaks. God does not speak to the other animals. God did not speak to our cat. Here is a fundamental truth of human existence - echoed throughout the Old Testament and repeated by Jesus himself - Matthew 4.4:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>And notice that God's word to the man is eminently practical. It's not telling him all he might want to know about life and the world. Rather, it is telling him what is necessary for his well-being. And notice too that God's word is not first a prohibition - it is not first a negative. Before God says, "you must not eat" in verse 17, he says in verse 16, "you are free to eat from any tree".<br><br>There is permission and encouragement. And it appears that in the area of God's permission, the man was free to choose which of the permitted trees he fancied. God allowed him his own tastes and preferences. Let me digress for a moment.<br><br><br><b>Guidance</b><br><br>There are big decisions that you have to make - many of you will have to make some big decisions very soon. There are decisions about jobs and housing and marriage and so forth. How do you decide? God wants you to be guided. Rom 8.14:</p>

<blockquote><div>Those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>One of the marks of the true Christian is to be led by the Holy Spirit." And that is why God's word is so important. The bible has key principles that you apply to your particular situations. Last time you were studying Genesis you were studying sexual relationships. Well, the bible makes it clear that sex is only for heterosexual monogamous marriage and you should only marry another believer.<br><br>There are many other principles to guide you as well. But how do you apply those in specific situations? What happens when there are three nice Christian girls or three nice Christian men you have to choose between, for example? How do you decide then? Well, you can trust that great promise in James 1.5-7:</p>

<blockquote><div>If any of you lacks wisdom [practical wisdom], he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. 6 But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 7 That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;</div></blockquote>

<p>There has to be a level of integrity in your praying for guidance. You've got to be willing to be open to God's answer; you mustn't have your mind made up already. And God knows your make up. He will guide you. And of course he can use circumstances.<br><br>But, and this is to get back to Genesis, some Christians can get so neurotic about guidance. You can meet some people who seem to need guidance as to which shoes to wear or which one to put on first! But this verse 16 suggests that there are areas in life where you can exercise personal choice and taste and still be in God's will. And your choice and taste will not necessarily be the same as your fellow Christians'. Some of them may support Sunderland while you support Newcastle - and there is nothing wrong in that (supporting Newcastle). So there is permission and freedom - verse 16: "you are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but (v17) ..." and it is a big "but". And that is because when you are outside God's will - when you exercise your own choice and taste in areas where God has said "no" - there is then disaster. Verse 17:but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.That is God's word to the man.<br><br><br><b>Disobedience and misrepresentation</b><br><br>Let's move on to the result. The result (in chapter 3) was disobedience and rejection. I want you to note 3 factors that led (and still lead) to disobedience and the rejection of God's word - which of course is sin - sin is basically rejecting or disobeying God and his word or law; and going your own way. 1 John 3.4:</p>

<blockquote><div>Everyone who sins breaks the law [or God's word and will]; in fact, sin is lawlessness.</div></blockquote>

<p>But if God's word is good and perfect - and it leads to the good life, which it does -, why do people not choose it? There is now research in the United States that shows that Christians do better on a host of indicators - from health, to education, to wealth, in terms of general happiness and, yes, in terms of their sex lives. If this is so, why don't people obey God? The basic reason is that Adam's sin introduced a new factor of sin into the world. We are all now born as sinful. This is what is called "original sin". We are now by nature spiritually dead "in trespasses and sins". We need new life, spiritually. That is the underlying cause. But that disposition we all have goes hand in hand with three strategies for rejecting God's word. This can be seen here in the Garden of Eden. And it can be seen today.<br><br>First, God's word was, and is, misrepresented by opponents - the enemies of God's word. Chapter 3 verse 1:</p>

<blockquote><div>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?</div></blockquote>

<p>Do you see, there is a total exaggeration here. The serpent is suggesting that there was a blanket prohibition on everything. The man and the woman were not to eat of any tree. But God hadn't said that. He had only forbidden one tree. Isn't that a favourite device that people still use to avoid God's word. They so state God's word that it is obviously ridiculous and false.<br><br>This happened to the Christians in the early centuries. Their enemies said that God's word allowed cannibalism and incest. They had heard the words "This is my body ... Take and eat" and also that everybody was called "brother and sister" and they "loved one another." So they built up this ridiculous Aunt Sally, and rejected the gospel accordingly. They said Christianity promoted cannibalism and incest. And it happens with your friends, I'm sure. Like the serpent, they make God out to be a mean ogre and a kill-joy. They exaggerate and misrepresent God's word, and so they reject it.<br><br><br><b>Exaggeration and doubting God's goodness</b><br><br>The second factor in disobeying God's word was, and is, exaggeration by "believers" themselves. This happens here with Adam and certainly by Eve. Look at verses 2 and 3 of chapter 3:</p>

<blockquote><div>The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 3 but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.</div></blockquote>

<p>Do you see what Eve is doing? She is adding to the commandment. God did not say they were not to "touch it". This is a man-made, or woman-made, "don't". Eve, so to speak, compensates by being over-strict. But that is dangerous. But it is so true to life.<br><br>Today sexual licence and permissiveness has to be resisted. But you can trace some of that permissiveness as a reaction to an over strict taboo on sex in the last century that went "beyond" God's law. The Pharisees in New Testament times were being over strict. They knew that God's law was not to be broken. So they set a "fence" around it. That is, they allowed a margin of safety by insisting at every point on a little more than the law required. For example, the Rabbis taught that certain acts should be avoided not just at 6.0 o'clock on Friday evening - the beginning of the Sabbath - but on Friday afternoons as well. That was in case you forgot and before you knew where you were, you were still doing them on Friday evening. There are other examples like that. But it is dangerous, because men and women are not intended to live more strictly than God ordained. Jesus said: (Luke 11:46):</p>

<blockquote><div>And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry.</div></blockquote>

<p>God never said to Eve, "you must not touch it".<br><br>The third factor in disobedience is to deny outright what God says. Gen 3.4:</p>

<blockquote><div>You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is the idea that disobedience to God will lead to fulfilment, while obedience leads to frustration.</p>

<blockquote><div>You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman. 5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."(Gen 3:5)</div></blockquote>

<p>Isn't this true to life? We think that if we obey God's word, we'll never enjoy ourselves. That is a lie of the devil.</p>

<blockquote><div>Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. (Psa 37:4) </div></blockquote>

<p>That has been my experience. When I decided at the University to go into full time Christian work, I had visions of the most boring and depressing life. Was it like that? Not at all. I have done so many exciting things. At the same time, some of my friends in business and other professions have been earning large sums of money but they are just looking forward to a pension. The tragedy is that we are all tempted to doubt God's goodness, and assume he wants to make our lives miserable. Eve thought that and disobeyed, and so did Adam.<br><br><br><b>The consequences</b><br><br>So first the Serpent had misrepresented what God had said; and Eve was then unhealthily strict about what God had said. It was then a short step for the serpent to misrepresent God altogether and deny his goodness. The man and the women fell for that and disobeyed. The consequences were disastrous - verse 8:</p>

<blockquote><div>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</div></blockquote>

<p>The wages of sin is death. And this new existence for Adam and Eve was a living death. There is shame and disorder in terms of the sexual instinct, verse 7:</p>

<blockquote><div>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</div></blockquote>

<p>There is also a disorder in their own relationship, verse 16:</p>

<blockquote><div>To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you." (Gen 3:16) </div></blockquote>

<p>There is disorder in terms of their relationship with God - verse 10 tells us the man is afraid of God now and has to hide. There are excuses and a denial of reality, a sure sign of sin (Gen 3:12-13):</p>

<blockquote><div>The man said, "The woman you put here with me--she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it." 13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</div></blockquote>

<p>The natural world is also affected - verses 17-18:</p>

<blockquote><div>To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. 18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.</div></blockquote>

<p>And Adam and Eve are banished from Eden - they have to go "East of Eden".<br><br>The wages of sin is death!<br><br>What a contrast with the second Adam, Jesus Christ, when he was tempted by the Devil. And why? Fundamentally he has a balanced grasp of God's written word - the Bible. He was rooted in its obvious and central teaching - in his case the Old Testament. And he used it against the devil. Look at Matthew 4 when you get home.<br><br><br><b>Hope</b><br><br>Is there hope? Of course, that is the gospel.<br><br>There is forgiveness of sins at Calvary. Who tonight has never reversed that fundamental folly of Adam? You do that by admitting that you too are just like Adam, and need forgiveness, and then receiving new life from Christ. How do you do that? You simply pray. Prayer is talking to God. And you can do that as you sit there, quite silently.<br><br>And remember these are important things. Genesis teaches that there was a beginning. The bible also teaches that one day there will be an end and each one of us will then have to give an account of ourselves to Almighty God. Are you ready for that day?<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Europe">(August 1998) Europe</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 1998</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Extremes</b><br><br>Let me begin with two extended quotations that express opposite and extreme views on Europe:<br><br>The basic elements in European conflict are race and religion. The confederacy of powers, which are centred around the Babylonish Roman Catholic religious system, are also partly Esau-orientated in race descent - Prussia in particular. This explains the continuing strategy to replace the world leadership of the Birthright nations of Celto-Saxondom who, being of Jacob-Ephraim descent, have the birthright commission from the Almighty to lead the nations in peace.<br><br>Our national governments and most Protestants today, have little or no understanding of this underlying struggle for supremacy in Europe that has been going on during the 20th century. In prophetic terms it is the climax in the classic confrontation of the descendants of the twin people or nations, Jacob and Esau, prior to the fullness of the Kingdom Age that will appear.<br><br>The Reformation was completed by the return of "Elijah" in the Kingdom identity teaching from 1840, but the vision was lost in the 20th century as the great falling away grew.<br><br>The creation of the European Union is a final throw, inspired by the spirit of Esau, and the counterfeit kingdom in papal Rome, in order to forestall the restoration of law in righteousness under Christ as King. It has been supported at our rear for a century and longer, by a constant pincer attack through Ireland.<br><br>So writes "Watchman" in the Jan/Feb edition this year [1998] of Wake Up! - a call to God's servant people. Contrast that with the more sober remarks of Winston Churchill - but in one sense also extreme (if quietly so) - in a celebrated speech on 19 September 1946 at the University of Zurich, soon after the end of the second World War. He said these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>I wish to speak to you to-day about the tragedy of Europe. This noble continent comprising on the whole the fairest and the most cultivated regions of the earth, enjoying a temperate and equable climate, is the home of all the great parent races of the western world. It is the fountain of Christian faith and Christian ethics. It is the origin of most of the culture, arts, philosophy and science both of ancient and modern times. If Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance, there would be no limit to the happiness, to the prosperity and glory which its three or four hundred million people would enjoy. Yet it is from Europe that have sprung that series of frightful nationalistic quarrels, originated by the Teutonic nations, which we have seen even in this twentieth century and in our own lifetime, wreck the peace and mar the prospects of all mankind.</div></blockquote>

<p>And what is the plight to which Europe has been reduced? Some of the smaller States have indeed made a good recovery, but over wide areas a vast quivering mass of tormented, hungry, care-worn and bewildered human beings gape at the ruins of their cities and homes, and scan the dark horizons for the approach of some new peril, tyranny or terror, Among the victors there is a babble of jarring voices; among the vanquished the sullen silence of despair. That is all that Europeans, grouped in so many ancient States and nations, that is all that the Germanic Powers have got by tearing each other to pieces and spreading havoc far and wide. Indeed, but for the fact that the great Republic across the Atlantic Ocean has at length realized that the ruin or enslavement of Europe would involve their own fate as well, and has stretched out hands of succour and guidance, the Dark Ages would have returned in all their cruelty and squalor. They may still return.<br><br>Yet all the while there is a remedy which, if it were generally and spontaneously adopted, would as if by a miracle transform the whole scene, and would in a few years make all Europe, or the greater part of it, as free and as happy as Switzerland is to-day. What is this sovereign remedy? It is to re-create the European family, or as much of it as we can, and provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom. We must build a kind of United States of Europe.<br><br><br><b>Two very different voices!</b><br><br>So how do we begin to cut through the Gordian knot that is Europe? I have to confess I am not going to start by exegeting Revelation 17.12 where we read about</p>

<blockquote><div>The ten horns [who ... ] are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.</div></blockquote>

<p>I will mention Revelation 17 later. I will begin at a much more mundane level, and with a question. What makes for a successful organization - any organisation - whether it is a church, a club, a business or a nation?<br><br>I always say four things are necessary. First, an agreed agenda; secondly, competent leadership; thirdly, enabling structures; and fourthly, meeting needs, whether of your members or your market.<br><br>So I want to be very simple and analyze Europe and the European project under those four headings - an agreed agenda; competent leadership; enabling structures; and meeting needs. If you haven't got all four things going for you - in whatever organization you are in - from the local fellowship of a Church, to the nation State - you will have major problems.<br><br><br><b>What is the agreed agenda?</b><br><br>First, what is the agreed agenda of Europe? This is the one thing above all others that is necessary. Without an agreed agenda, an agreed idea of what you are about, organizations soon fall apart. You can only live on PR and "hype" for so long.<br><br>Sir Fred Catherwood is quite clear about the objective of the new Europe. I quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>The first objective of the Community is to create peace in place of Europe's terrible tribal wars, the last two of which cost 50 million dead.</div></blockquote>

<p>Undoubtedly this was the great vision of the early founders of post-war Europe and their institutions. Jean Monnet, the great architect of modern Europe had this as his goal. But he also had another goal. Quite publicly he expressed his motivation for establishing a new European order as the glories of the old Holy Roman Empire.<br><br>And that is the second objective many have for the European Union. As a student at Oxford in the early sixties, I can remember getting into discussion on Europe with my tutor, Peter Strawson, now Sir Peter Strawson. He was championing the proposals in 1962 for Britain's entry into the EEC. These proposals came to an abrupt end in January 1963 when de Gaulle of France vetoed Britain's application. Peter Strawson unashamedly said that his desire for European Union was quite romantic. He liked the thought of reconstructing the old Holy Roman Empire.<br><br>The dream of a united Europe, of course, has a long history and it certainly goes back to the Romans themselves. At the peak of its power, Rome ruled Europe from the Pyrenees to the Black Forest - but interestingly they never conquered the tribes of Germany. Charlemagne had the good sense to learn the lesson. When he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 800, he tried to win the support of the Germanic princes. But the Holy Roman Empire didn't last. Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hitler all had ideas of creating a united Europe, but by force. There was, interestingly, a Nazi memorandum in June 1943 for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was a planning document that foresaw a "European community", a "closer community" of countries which voluntarily embraced "European solidarity" and "European obligations". The dream for a united Europe has a long and wide history.<br><br>The third objective is economic benefit. Nor is this anything new. Before the second World War the Hungarian economist Elemer Hantos argued powerfully that the unfettering of European commerce would bring about a unified economic region. He believed that European unity required high levels of employment, low prices and an expanding market economy. Economic security would be the true foundation of political stability. So what is wrong with all of these? Are these not good aspirations? Yes, in a way.<br><br>But the real problem, in terms of Europe having an agreed agenda, is that Jean Monnet, the father of the European Community, and master politician that he was, never really declared his hand. He believed that the Continent and its long term unity did not need a single grand act of union. Rather it would come about by a slow and steady process - treaties, policies, commissions, and regulations that would spawn and have effect. So don't tell anyone you want to go big! He wrote in 1952 to M Shuman:<br><br>Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.<br><br>And so you had, first of all, the European Coal and Steel Community. That in time lead on to the European Economic Community.<br><br>But without clear goals publicly expressed, conflicts of interests were inevitable. Monnet's hidden agenda for the development of a new and slowly developing European Empire does not go hand in hand with the much lower and limited aim of financial gain and security. That conflict was evident in those early days of the European Coal and Steel Community. Here is Harold Macmillan declaring:</p>

<blockquote><div>Our people will not hand over to any supranational authority the right to close our pits or our steel works.</div></blockquote>

<p>What is new? And, of course, there are problems with both visions - of a new great empire and of economic gain.<br><br>A new Holy Roman Empire - and, sadly, now without the "holy" dimension - would be very difficult to sustain. Unifying beliefs in the modern world will take on more importance as we enter the 21st century - witness the appeal of Islam. So a secular Europe would have - and is having - a bad start. Also the complications of the modern world mean there is huge difficulty in having one political unit steered from what is hoped will be a unifying centre.<br><br>That was part of the issue at the Reformation. Of course, as we well know at the Christian Institute, the Reformation dealt with fundamental theological issues such as the fact of the grace of God, the primacy of faith in Christ alone, and the authority of the bible. But also there was the issue of the independence of the local Province. People in outlying parts were less and less willing to be told what to do by people hundreds of miles away in Rome who did not know local facts and so could not solve local problems. The opposition to the Papacy was in part due to the Papacy providing an inefficient system that simply benefited the fat cats in Rome rather than the people in the Provinces. Those realities are the same today.<br><br>What, then, about economic benefit? That too, I hardly need tell you, is under debate. On 1 Jan 1999 some nations will have given up their power to mint and manage their own money - a key element in modern government. All will be controlled by a European Central Bank as European Monetary Union takes shape. Now, if there was an "agreed agenda" that would be fine. But the problem is that the European Union is only half a free-trade area - for services and industrial goods. In agriculture it is a wasteful cartel, as it has been put, designed to protect farmers. One half of the EU budget ($45 billion) goes into farm support to sustain high prices. Another $33 billion bails out Spain, Portugal and Greece. Aggressive industry and establishing interests rates to help financial houses sit ill with propping up poor farmers. And the French farmers are quite expressive on the subject. They are quite capable of storming city halls.<br><br>There are indeed many problems over having an agreed agenda for Europe.<br><br><br><b>Competent leadership</b><br><br>Secondly, what about competent leadership?<br><br>The EU has six main institutional bodies for leadership - one, the European Parliament (which has few teeth); two, the European Commission which is the EU's executive - made up of 20 Commissioners, appointed by member governments for 5 years. It proposes Community laws, puts them into effect and manages EU policies. Three, the Council of Ministers which decides all laws and so is effectively the legislature. It is made up of government ministers from the member states who lead on the subject under discussion (e.g. Agriculture, Transport etc.). Four, the European Council which is made up of the heads of State, and meets in summit twice a year to give overall political direction. Five, the European Court of Justice which interprets and applies Community law. And six, the Court of Auditors which oversees the Community budget.<br><br>You say that is reasonable. But the trouble is that that all means a huge bureaucracy. Europe is so big. And that means more work for everyone. If you are now a British minister you have more trips to Brussels than you had before. That is more work. There are only twenty four hours in the day, so you delegate work. You cannot read all the papers. And when there is little agreement over the agenda and people have different value systems, you cannot assume compliance. An element of force, in the form or policed rules, becomes necessary. This gives power to the enforcers and power to the bureaucracy. That is dangerous.<br><br>Ivan Illich has described the inherent problems of some of the new professional classes that find their way into modern bureaucratic institutions like the institutions of the EU. They generate, he argues, disabling institutions. He tells how they ...</p>

<blockquote><div>need clients in order to survive ... and they create and define problems, diseases and deficiencies which they, and they only, have the skills to put right. They disable their clients in order to enable them, creating thereby a spurious dependency and problems which need never have been invented.</div></blockquote>

<p>But let us assume a benign bureaucracy and a well intentioned leadership. There is then the more fundamental question that must be faced in terms of politics and government. And that is "what is the State for?" What ought a government to be doing anyway? That is a very important question. It takes up back to the last Christian Institute lecture on Calvin and Church and State. We were then told that in the Institutes Book 4 section 20 you have Calvin's view that the State is 1) to promote civil justice and outward morality; 2) to restrain sin (negatively) - [hearts could not be changed and they may be totally depraved; but you don't have to live out this morality]; but also 3) to promote humanity - to let love guide and love rule - [Calvin didn't see that it was the State's duty to ensure the people had a good time]; and 4) to help the Church. Calvin wanted a co-operative relationship between Church and State. That is one view of the relationship between Church and State. But what we weren't told last time was that Luther had a more pragmatic view. He believed that the State was to be more minimal and primarily to curb the worst excesses of sinful men and women. That reflects an important Christian debate about the origin and scope of government. Andrew Goddard summarizes the debate neatly:<br><br>Some (classically Augustine) have argued that government is instituted by God but as a post-Fall institution. Its task is to respond to human sin by upholding the common good and executing limited judgement over the community on the basis of a higher law. Its task is, in the words of Romans 13, "to bear the sword" and "bring punishment on the wrongdoer." Others (classically Thomas Aquinas) believe that although government now has this juridical role, it was also originally part of God's good created order. In creation it was ordained to have a directive role within human society even without sin.<br><br>And Goddard argues that the decision you reach on the relative merits of those two positions ...</p>

<blockquote><div>will prove of significance in relation to the EU's institutions. The EU is almost wholly a directive, administrative system of government.</div></blockquote>

<p>The fact is that modern European States are by no means minimal. They are more and more all embracing; and even sometimes quasi-totalitarian in the sense of invading the whole of life - not least the family. In a nutshell, Europe has a more Aquinan or Calvinistic approach to politics, while the USA has a more Augustinian or Lutheran approach to politics. When you have a Christian society and Christian values as was more the case in the past in Europe, a directive Government poses fewer problems. But when there is little agreement as to basic beliefs, when pluralism, materialism, secularism, and often anti-Christianity in the terms of sexual morality rules, there will be problems. And we have problems. So much for leadership.<br><br><br><b>Structures</b><br><br>Thirdly, we come now to structures. And the question here is, "Are the EU's structures enabling?" There are a number of important issues that call for comment. <br><br>One of the great platforms behind the institution of the new Europe was not only peace but, in Churchillian terms, the desire for democracy. Jacques Maritain was the Christian thinker and father-figure behind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On the world scene after the war and at the same time, he paralleled Jean Monnet. Maritain argues powerfully that the bible and the doctrine of freedom in the bible mean that democracy is congruous with the gospel and should be pursued. And I would agree. But you have to be careful.<br><br>In the name of democracy and everyone having their say, there can be huge inefficiencies. It is so easy in the name of democracy to confuse "consent" with "consensus". Here is Charles Handy:<br><br>Effective democracy relies on consent. He or she who governs does so with the trust and consent of those who are governed. who have the right and power to get rid of the governor when that trust and respect are exhausted. Those in charge take the decisions, which can be implemented only with the consent of those who carry them out ... It is difficult, but it works very well with the right person in charge.<br><br>Consensus on the other hand requires that everyone takes every decision. It is a travesty of democracy, time-consuming, irritating and fraught with politics and factions. It is usually so frustrating that it is quickly allowed to degenerate into an autocracy or the dictatorship of a clique if only to allow something, anything, to happen. Democracy is a dangerous slogan on its own.<br><br>Because the whole conception of the EU is not to have strong leadership, you therefore have to play the game of "consensus" with all those problems. I need say no more! Then there is the issue of "subsidiarity". Europe talks a lot about "subsidiarity". Subsidiarity is actually part of the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. It says that there is a moral principle for a higher-order body not to do things that a lower-order body can do perfectly well. It is supposed to be the very opposite of centralism. It is to give people as much responsibility as they can cope with.<br><br>But if you have a huge complex organization, like an empire, the very need for the co-ordination of subsidiary activities means a huge concentration of power in the co-ordinators. And in any organization the people who control information flow have disproportionate power and influence. Subsidiarity only works when there is an understanding of genuine Federalism.<br><br>Decentralism is very different from federalism. In decentralised structures the centre is still in command but has delegated a range of tasks to the periphery. In federalist constitutions, the centre is the residuary body, doing the things which the parts cannot or do not want to do - delegation the other way round. Centralised structures mandate subsidiarity from the top. Genuine federalism mandates subsidiarity from the bottom. The danger in Europe is the prospect of decentralism and not genuine federalism. So what do we say about these structural issues? Has the bible anything to say?<br><br>Clearly the Christian is to seek to live at peace with all men and women. Peace and peace-generating structures must, therefore, be welcomed as Jean Monnet wanted and Fred Catherwood now wants. But there is a danger in the over exalting of structures and peace keeping. It leads to the belief that war can be prevented by politics and other measures are then neglected. This happened after the first World War. Only when Christ returns will swords be beaten into ploughshares. Before then, as Jesus says, there will be "wars and rumours of wars" and that is due, not to political arrangements or the lack of them, but to human sin. James 4:1-3</p>

<blockquote><div>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? 2 You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God. 3 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.</div></blockquote>

<p>The great need, therefore, for Europe is not union but conversion - peace with God in the first place. But the really great danger in respect to the new Europe is the inherent danger in Empires. That is why there is some truth in the references by Christians to the book of Revelation in respect of the European issue. The Old Testament sees Babel as a symbol. And it cannot be ignored. You need to go back to Genesis to understand that symbol. Genesis sees the division of the world into nations as subsequent to the Fall. Unlike marriage or man's dominion over the earth, the nations are not part of the original creation. It is only in Genesis 10, after the Flood, that we meet the nations. We read in verse 32:</p>

<blockquote><div>the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.</div></blockquote>

<p>Then in Genesis 11 we have the account of Babel. The nations tried to unite. But with sin in the world that unity was accompanied by pride; and God saw that such an imperium as was planned at Babel had to be restrained and judged. Building the Tower at Babel was the uniting in a common project without reference to God. Babel, of course, relates to Babylon that then becomes synonymous with the evil Empire and evil Empires in the Old Testament and also in the book of Revelation 17-19. It stands for all godless power. So if the cap fits, nations and empires have to wear it, whether the empires of pagan Rome, Hitler, Stalin or whoever. Therefore because some Christians exaggerate the material in Revelation, those warnings should not be neglected. It is not that Europe has to be an evil empire. The Bible shows that God works providentially in and through the nations. This is clear in Israel's history and in the New Testament, Acts 17.26:</p>

<blockquote><div>From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.</div></blockquote>

<p>But nations and empires without God will be evil. And currently Europe appears to be ignoring God.<br><br><br><b>Meeting needs</b><br><br>Finally, what about meeting needs? What is best for Europe? I believe we can live with any form of Government. Jesus lived under the first Roman Empire, the first extended Europe. The New Testament reveals an ambivalent attitude to the Roman Empire of the 1st century. Clearly Paul used the Roman Empire for evangelism - its roads and its cities. God, in the fullness of time, had become incarnate during the period of the Roman Empire. Its structures and peace helped the Gospel go forward.<br><br>But Rome was also demonic. There were terrible persecutions and violence. Paul summed it up in 1 Cor 16. 9:</p>

<blockquote><div>a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.</div></blockquote>

<p>That I think is important for the question of how we should respond to Europe. Europe provides possibilities; it is also dangerous. Therefore, be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves. Analyse the situation carefully. Make wise political judgments - which will be the least worse options in many cases - and then evangelise. Europe's needs ultimately will only be met by the gospel. Pentecost reversed Babel not by setting up new political structures but by the Holy Spirit convicting men and women of the truth about Jesus and the resurrection and calling them through the preaching of the gospel to repentance. Paul wrote to Timothy - and I never tire of quoting it:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 2 Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction. 3} For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. (2 Tim 4:1-5)</div></blockquote>

<p>That, indeed, is relevant to our reponse to the question of Europe.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Shorter Catechism (Part 1)">(September 1998) The Shorter Catechism (Part 1)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 1998</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>At the time of the Reformation Luther used "the Catechism" - a form of "question" and "answer" - for teaching the elements of Christian theology. The other Reformers followed his example. One of the most famous of the Catechisms is the English "Shorter Catechism". Completed in 1647 and approved by Parliament on 15 September 1648, it is Presbyterian rather than Anglican. But in this period of "post-denominationalism" we all can learn from it. The following is a modernized and edited version of this famous Catechism. Part 2 is to follow in a subsequent Coloured Supplment.<br><br><br><i>Q1: What is the chief end of man?</i></p>

                <p><b>Sex, lies and videotape</b><br><br>The serious issue behind the videotape of President Clinton's testimony to the Grand Jury from the White House on 17 August 1998, has been highlighted in the press, on the radio and on TV as "sex". Hence the reporting of the sordid details of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But as important, if not more important, are the lies or alleged lies. Indeed, the vast quantity of salacious material that has been published is an attempt by Kenneth Starr to prove that Clinton has been lying.<br><br>The modern world is awash with lies. President Clinton is simply a symptom of the problem; and as the most powerful man in the world, when found lying he inevitably acts as a focus for this moral disease that we all are in danger of being infected with at the end of the 20th century. <br><br>Some think the problem is so acute that popular "lie detectors" are being marketed for home use. No longer will they be the exclusive tools of police departments. Current polygraph machines that monitor blood pressure, perspiration, breathing and pulse rates cost up to £7,000. But there is now a cheap PC programme on a CD-rom named Truster. And it costs only £110.<br><br>To pass its verdict the machine simply records the frequencies of a person's voice. Tests have found that it is 85 percent accurate. Devised to catch potential terrorists at border checkpoints in Israel, it can now have a wider use. Indeed, an experiment was tried on President Clinton's infamous words "I did not have sexual relations with that woman - Monica Lewinsky". And the result? It showed that during the press conference when Clinton wagged his finger and asserted his innocence, he was under great stress and had signs of "extreme excitement in his voice." The conclusion was that "the subject never lied but there were some inaccuracies". Clinton had a global honesty rating of 94 per cent. So much for its accuracy!<br><br>That lying is a serious modern problem only dawned on me in the late 1980's. Of course, I, as most did, knew that people lied. And people lied in public life. I can remember well the Profumo scandal with John Profumo lying to the House of Commons over his relationship with Christine Keeler and bringing to an end the Macmillan era. But lying then in the 1960's was generally believed to be wrong. However, late in the 1980's I read a book on management. In it lying was being suggested as one strategy among others for the manager to consider in problem-solving. True, it was a risky strategy, but one to be considered.<br><br>I was profoundly shocked. I realised that the world had changed. That, of course, was why there was by now a striking loss of confidence in public leaders in government, the law, business, medicine and, sometimes, the church. In America the change was well documented, beginning with 1960. That was the year the American people were genuinely astonished to discover that President Eisenhower had lied when asked about the U-2 spy plane that had been shot down over Russia. By the mid-70's after lies from President Johnson over US involvement in Vietnam and from President Nixon over Watergate, 69 percent, according to a national poll agreed that "over the last ten years, this country's leaders have consistently lied to the people" (Cambridge Survey Research 1975, 1976).<br><br><br><b>The 1990's epidemic</b><br><br>The erosion of contemporary morality in terms of lying has a long history. Undoubtedly the 1960's moral revolution in which liberal churchmen played a prominent part had a great effect. However, it is more recently that there has been an escalation, certainly in the West. In the 1980's there was a veneer of morality during the Thatcher/Reagan years; but some young political bloods brought on over that period became part of a new 1990's epidemic of deceit and decadence. There is now no longer the honourable immediate resignation from office and the immersion in some piece of quiet charitable work. Rather there can well be an absence of shame, the enjoyment of fortune and some form of media celebrity status.<br><br>On Tyneside the 1990's epidemic was epitomized exactly eight years ago this Autumn in the Lesbian Adoption case. On 30 September 1990 the Sunday Express stated that two lesbians were adopting a boy under the age of ten in Newcastle. The story was picked up in the Evening Chronicle on 1 October 1990. The chairman of Newcastle Social Services committee, Councillor Tony Flynn, according to the press said that the boy was handicapped and that the only alternative to the placement with the lesbian couple was long term care in a hospital or institution (The Journal, 2 October 1990).<br><br>Bryan Roycroft, the Director of Social Services for Newcastle and a distinguished national figure, was quoted as saying that the child would have "a quality of life he would never experience in a hospital or institution." These press reports led people to believe that the boy had been placed for adoption with a lesbian couple as an alternative to life in an institution or a hospital. But on 8 October an experienced (and irate) foster mother told the press that she had fostered the boy for two and a half years since he was a tiny baby and had applied to adopt him herself after learning that another couple had applied to adopt the child (Evening Chronicle, 8 October 1990). Her application, however, had been turned down and the boy was taken away and placed for adoption with the lesbian couple (one a social worker and the other a former employee of Newcastle City Council). The comments, of course, made by the foster mother called into question the reported statements made by Newcastle Social Services and its director about the alternative to lesbian adoption being institutional care.<br><br>After a national uproar the case reached the High Court in January 1991. The judge then ordered the little boy to be returned to the foster mother on the ground of the existing bond between the foster mother and the boy.<br><br><br><b>1997 - 1998</b><br><br>This epidemic has sadly affected the wider church. An example was 14 July 1997. That morning I was asked to appear on the BBC TV Breakfast News Extra to debate the lowering of the age of consent for homosexual sex with the pro-Gay bishop Derek Rawcliffe.<br><br>In the course of our discussion I said: "The bishop ... he's wanting to lower the age of consent for children aged 14". I was then amazed when the bishop replied in front of the hundreds of thousands, probably millions, watching (and these are his exact words from the videotape): "I want to correct something David Holloway has said. I have not said that I want to lower the age of consent to 14. I want that to be made quite clear." As soon as I got home from the studio I searched for a copy of the letter from Bishop Derek Rawcliffe that had appeared in the Gay Times of August 1996. When I found it I read once again these words: "ideally starting with the age of puberty we don't need an age of consent for gay sex, though I think 14 would be reasonable."<br><br>It needs to be added that to go through this sort of experience when, by another's deceit or "economy with the truth", you yourself are suspected of being the deceiver (when you are not), is very disturbing. And this is the experience we had at Jesmond earlier this year when we took exception to the new Bishop of Newcastle's view that gay sex is sometimes permitted for Christians - a view that denies biblical teaching as the recent Lambeth Conference has so helpfully reminded us.<br><br>But this past month, September 1998, things seem to have got even worse, in the wake of the Clinton saga - or it may be that we now have to be more suspicious. You can hardly open your paper or listen to the news without wondering - "is this a lie or not?"<br><br>There has been, for example, the sad death, at the young age of 38, of the great athlete Florence Griffith Joyner (Flo Jo) who still holds the records at 100 and 200 meters. The announcement of her death on TV was accompanied with claims that she had taken performance enhancing drugs and the suggestion that her death was a consequence. But there she was, resurrected on TV, filmed in the late 1980's, denying she had ever taken them. The media, however, generally gave the impression they thought she had. In the context of President Clinton and his denials, how do we now know who to trust?<br><br>At the same time, at the end of September, there was the good news of the release of the hostages, Camilla Carr and Jon James from Chechnya. The Foreign Office denied that a ransom had been paid. But as The Times reported on 22 September: "a meeting at the Foreign Office between a Russian millionaire businessman and a senior British official with experience of intelligence and counter-terrorism appears to have played a crucial part in the release of the two Britons ... no one in Whitehall doubted that the meeting between Mr Berezovsky [the Russian] and Mr Budd [the Briton] helped to finalise the deal that led to their freedom."<br><br>How in the public world of today do you know what to believe? It may not have been a technical "ransom", in the same way as President Clinton's was not a technical "sexual relationship". On 17 January this year in his deposition in the Paula Jones civil law suit he said: "I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her." But after tape recordings from Linda Tripp, statements by Monica Lewinsky and now his own confessions, we know that he had. Are words being used like that by our government officials? If so, it needs to be recognized that civil society (and what indeed we call civilization) will be hard pressed to sustain itself if such a culture of suspicion and de facto lies is allowed to continue. This is not to moralize. It is hard reality.<br><br><br><b>The Bible</b><br><br>So what does the bible have to say about lying and lies? It seems clear enough. The ten commandments do not have a direct prohibition against lying as such. But there is the ninth commandment against "false testimony": "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour" (Ex 20.16).<br><br>However, prophets, psalmists and wisdom writers were quite direct. For example, Psalm 34.13 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking lies.</div></blockquote>

<p>Proverbs 12.22 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in men who are truthful.</div></blockquote>

<p>Zechariah 8.16 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts.</div></blockquote>

<p>And through the prophets God was especially damning of lying religious leaders:</p>

<blockquote><div>For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives and in my name have spoken lies (Jeremiah 29.23).</div></blockquote>

<p>The New Testament is also direct and definite. First, it gives us Jesus own teaching. For example, he taught that the devil was behind all lying as himself "a liar and the father of lies" (John 8.44). He taught that the truth was liberating: "the truth will set you free" (John 8.32). He taught that the Holy Spirit was "the Spirit of truth" (John 14.17). And he said to Pilate: "for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me" (John 18.37). He also pronounced a virtual anathema on hypocrisy.<br><br>Then the New Testament gives us the Apostles' teaching. Here, for example, is Paul instructing the Colossians: "Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices" (Col 3.9). Here he is instructing the Ephesians: "put off falsehood and speak truthfully" Eph 4.25). And truth, he says, must be spoken "in love". The book of Revelation says this is all very, very serious. It says that "everyone who loves and practices falsehood" will ultimately be "outside" the heavenly city, in a situation of unimaginable awfulness (Rev 21.8; 22.15). That is why the gospel of Christ - the gospel of repentance and forgiveness - is such good news. But there can be no hope if people do not recognise that there is a problem to repent of and falsehood that needs to be forgiven.<br><br><br><b>Other writings</b><br><br>This clear teaching of the bible is not always echoed when you turn to some modern writing, even some Christian writing. Take the modern Dictionary of Christian Ethics from the SCM press. There you read the following:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is clear that there may be circumstances in which it is right to tell a lie ... The only way to have the sensitivity of spirit to know when a lie is called for in particular circumstances is to be habitually truthful.</div></blockquote>

<p>Written in 1967 this is proposing a justifiable falsehood - something the New Testament never entertains. But this is now a common view and widely held. President Clinton may hold it. Lawrence Henderson certainly does. Some time ago Henderson wrote this (as a medical doctor):</p>

<blockquote><div>Above all, remember that it is meaningless to speak of telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to a patient. It is meaningless because it is impossible ... Since telling the truth is impossible, there can be no sharp distinction between what is true and what is false ... So far as possible do not harm. You can do harm by the process that is quaintly called telling the truth. You can do harm by lying ... But try to do as little harm as possible.</div></blockquote>

<p>Here the criterion of harm makes this a utilitarian ethic (if it works, OK, or "the end justifies the means"). Charles Curtis a lawyer seems to be even stronger in his convictions:</p>

<blockquote><div>I don't see why we should not come out roundly and say that one of the functions of the lawyer is to lie for his client.</div></blockquote>

<p>Then remember Hitler. He used a utilitarian ethic to justify lying to millions. He was not the first national leader to say that the good of the state justified lying. But he probably was the first to talk about the "big lie". In Mein Kampf he wrote: "The great masses of the people ... will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one." And he proved the truth of that proposition in his own terrible Nazi way. But he was only following the steer of his compatriot, the philosopher Nietzsche, who had written some time before: "a great man ... he rather lies than tells the truth."<br><br>The clock must be turned back and turned back to that earlier Christian ethic - the biblical ethic that the church and the world followed for centuries. That is why President Clinton, as a symbol, is so important. If he does not resign or get impeached, public trust may be so eroded that in the words of Hannah Arendt we are not able "to take our bearings in the real world." This happens with brainwashing and it may happen if President Clinton's lying is simply shrugged off as a minor peccadillo. Hannah Arendt writes:<br><br>It has frequently been noted that the surest result of brainwashing in the long run is a peculiar kind of cynicism, the absolute refusal to believe in the truth of anything, no matter how well it may be established. In other words, the result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth, and truth be defamed as lie, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world - and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.<br><br>We are all now, more and more, drifting into "a peculiar kind of cynicism". That is the measure of the problem. And it is extremely unhealthy. If, on the other hand, Clinton does resign, that will help to rehabilitate truth-telling as an essential public and social cement. Of course, the President can be forgiven by God and his wife. Let us pray that he is seeking that forgiveness. King David, in the Old Testament, was in a similar situation after his affair with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11 and 12). He genuinely repented and was forgiven (Psalm 51). But he still suffered. Being King he could not resign. He had to stay and experience the consequences of his sin in the form of Absolom's rebellion and worse. Bill Clinton, however, is not a King and can resign. For his own good and the good of others, surely he should.<br><br><br><b>Classical Christian doctrine</b><br><br>The classical Christian doctrine on lying that we need to return to today was articulated first by Augustine:</p>

<blockquote><div>But every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive. Now it is evident that speech was given to man, not that men might therewith deceive one another, but that one man might make known his thoughts to another. To use speech, then, for the purpose of deception, and not for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to suppose that there is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes possible, by telling a lie, to do service to another (The Enchiridion).</div></blockquote>

<p>Augustine was supported by John Wesley:</p>

<blockquote><div>If any, in fact, do this - either teach men to do evil that good may come or do so themselves, their damnation is just. This is particularly applicable to those who tell lies in order to do good thereby. It follows, that officious lies, as well as all others, are an abomination to the God of Truth. Therefore there is no absurdity, however strange it may sound, in that saying of the ancient Father "I would not tell a wilful lie to save the souls of the whole world" (Sermons).</div></blockquote>

<p>But their opponents ask: "what about the case, cited by the philosopher Kant, of a would-be murderer who inquires whether 'our friend who is pursued by him had taken refuge in our house' and mere silence or evasion will not work?" Samuel Johnson, for example, said:</p>

<blockquote><div>The General Rule, is that truth should never be violated; there must, however, be some exceptions. If, for instance, a murderer should ask you which way a man has gone.</div></blockquote>

<p>However, Cardinal Newman took issue with Johnson saying it wasn't as simple as that:</p>

<blockquote><div>As to Johnson's case of a murderer asking which way a man has gone, I should have anticipated that, had such a difficulty happened to him, his first act would have been to knock the man down, and to call out for the police; and next, if he was worsted in the conflict, he would not have given the ruffian the information he asked at whatever risk to himself. I think he would have let himself be killed first.</div></blockquote>

<p>Kant himself supports Augustine and Wesley. He argued that there was a duty of truthfulness in all situations. He said that a lie always harms mankind generally. And it harms the liar himself by destroying his human dignity and making him more worthless than a thing: "by a lie a man throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a man" (Doctrine of Virtue).<br><br><br><b>The tragic situation</b><br><br>Augustine knew of the problem cases. He knew of the cases in the Old Testament where deception seems to achieve good results. He denied, however, that there was such a thing as justifiable falsehood. True, he argued that some lies are worse than others. He had, in fact, an eightfold distinction, with the worst being lies in teaching about God and ending up with lies that do no harm but seem to help someone:</p>

<blockquote><div>It cannot be denied that they have attained a very high standard of goodness who never lie except to save a man from injury; but in the case of men who have reached this standard, it is not the deceit, but their good intention, that is justly praised, and sometimes even rewarded. It is quite enough that the deception should be pardoned, without its being made an object of laudation.</div></blockquote>

<p>What this analysis points to, is this. If a good person does lie in an impossible situation, that is not to be seen as a "right action". Rather the whole situation is to be seen as a tragedy. That is because all lies are evil. The individual is being caught up in a totality of evil. So a good person, according to Augustine, is, and should feel, guilty if they lie to save the life of another. But God will forgive, if there is repentance. Augustine believed the way he did, because he had a clear belief that this life is not all there is. Heaven (and hell) awaits. He knew that death killed the body, but lying kills the soul. He argued, therefore, that to lie to save the life of another is a foolish bargain: "Therefore, does he not speak most perversely who says that one person ought to die spiritually so that another may live corporally?"<br><br>Augustine also believed in the sovereignty of God. To lie in the hope of helping another presupposes that your information is correct, that you have a level of omnipotence, and that there is no other way out. Nor was all this an academic exercise for Augustine and his generation. Many of the early Christians were given the opportunity to lie to save their own lives. The question some of the authorities wanted to know from them was this: "did they believe in Jesus Christ?" If they admitted it, they were martyred. If they didn't, they were freed? Should they tell a lie or act a lie? Some did. Many did not. They refused to give in to Caesar. And through their commitment to the truth, the world has enjoyed a culture of truth for centuries. In time this has allowed so much to develop and evolve in terms of scientific achievement and democratic institutions, all of which can only work on a basis of truthfulness. So this classical Christian tradition of never lying has been an important part of Western civilization.<br><br>Today we could be seeing that civilization beginning to unravel. Not, of course, that the gates of Hades will prevail against the church. Jesus taught that that would never happen. But the centre of gravity for the church, with enormous long-term consequences, can well change. It changed in the early days of the church when it moved from Jerusalem to Antioch. It then moved from Antioch to Rome. It then moved from Rome to Northern Europe and the US (and Australia). Why could it not now move to a new location? The recent Lambeth Conference has indicated that the guardianship of Christian doctrine and the Christian moral tradition could now be relocating to Africa, South East Asia and parts of South America. Time alone will tell.<br><br><br><b>Objective truth</b><br><br>But the classical Christian tradition is not just about truth telling at all times. It underlines objective truth and the importance of loyalty to objective truth in a way we have so forgotten in the 20th century. Modern views of lying focus on the discrepancy between the lie uttered and the thought in the mind. But the classical Christian tradition is just as concerned with the discrepancy between a statement uttered and reality or fact - what is objectively true. Today there is a leniency if something false is said in ignorance, but not if it is intentional. So denying God and affirming immoral behaviour are acceptable, even though they are ignorant lies. Previously it was said that ignorance was culpable because it caused others to suffer. But the common view today is that we are entitled to ignore truth but not to pervert it.<br><br>The bible does not allow us to think that ignorance automatically means we are morally acceptable. Nor does Roman law or our own legal system simply allow ignorance of the law to be an automatic grounds for escaping the consequences of an act. While attaching to them lesser degrees of guilt, the Old Testament certainly refers to sins of ignorance (eg Lev 14; Num 15.22-32). Similarly, on the one hand, Jesus suggests that ignorance modifies responsibility - Luke 23.34: "Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And Paul suggests the same in 1 Timothy 1.13: "Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief." But on the other hand, Jesus also taught the parable of the two servants in Luke 12.47-48: "That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. {48} But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows."<br><br>Whatever the level of guilt, Christians have always seen it as a duty to dispel falsehood. And not only today but throughout the centuries falsehood with regard to divine truth is, and has been, the greatest problem the church of Christ has to face. John asks (1 John 2.22):</p>

<blockquote><div>Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ.</div></blockquote>

<p>And, as a postscript, the classical Christian tradition linked truth-telling with justice. Bishop Butler in the 18th century linked falsehood with injustice and unprovoked violence as a cardinal vice. He said that "veracity [truthfulness] as well as justice is to be our rule of life." Today justice and "social justice" have high moral status, but truthfulness (and sexual morality that is linked to truthfulness through "fidelity") has become dispensable.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>So we come full circle. A concern about lying should mean not only an attempt to re-establish and teach what the bible calls "the law" - God's requirement for truthfulness (and we must pray and work to that end). But then we need to evangelize and work to re-establish "the gospel" - the truth that is hidden and concealed because "the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God." Lying will remain a problem until God causes, by his Holy Spirit, his light to shine in human hearts - "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ" (2 Cor 4.4,6). That alone will bring new moral strength.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Second Coming of Jesus">(December 1998) The Second Coming of Jesus</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1998</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Is it Believable?</strong></p><p>What would their contemporaries have noticed most about the early Christians?</p><p>The Apostle Paul gives a very clear answer. He writes to the Thessalonian Christians that people were telling ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>... how you [the Christians in Thessalonica] turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead - Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath</em> (1 Thess 1.9-10).</div></blockquote>
<p>So these Christians were noted for two things. On the one hand they were known as people who served the true God and not false gods - presumably by seeking to be obedient to him both privately and publicly. On the other hand they were known as people who were "waiting for his Son from heaven". That was because they knew, as the Apostles' Creed says:</p>
<blockquote><div>he [Jesus] will come again to judge the living and the dead.</div></blockquote>
<p>But is that believable today at the end of the 20th century?</p><p>As always we must distinguish what is believable from what is imaginable. Much that cannot be imagined can be believed. Certainly what is unimaginable to one generation is fully believable by the next. That has been true of space travel, for example. We must also, of course, distinguish cautiously expressed truth from dogmatic assertions in a subject where dogmatism is impossible.</p><p>In many ways Christ's Second Coming is unimaginable. But our imagination cannot determine what is possible with God. Isaiah says in the Old Testament:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts" declares the Lord. </em>(Isaiah 55.9).</div></blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally what is being asserted is this: at present Jesus by his Holy Spirit is spiritually present to millions and at the same time, every day. But at some point in the future when he comes again he will make himself visibly present in a public way. And the New Testament says this will happen.</p><p>The doctrine of what is called the "blessed hope" of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is referred to about 300 times (on average once in every 15 verses of the New Testament - that contrasts with the fact that Holy Communion is mentioned only on four clear occasions).</p><p><br><strong>What will it be like?</strong></p><p>But what will it be like? How can it happen? We cannot be certain. But one clue is given in the narrative of the Acts of the Apostles where it describes the Ascension of Jesus. We are told that "two men dressed in white" (presumably some sort of an angelic presence) said this, Acts 1.11:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>"But then isn't all this mythology?" someone asks. "No one can believe the Ascension today. Therefore, if the Second Coming is in some way a reversal of the Ascension, it falls as the Ascension falls."</p><p>But why should the Ascension "fall"? The early Christians certainly believed that Jesus had ascended. Peter writes about Jesus as the one ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand - with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him </em>(1 Pet 3.22).</div></blockquote>
<p>How could such a belief come about without the event recorded in Acts 1.9? That says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>he</em> [Jesus] <em>was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Nor is this disproved because some say it implies a "three-decker" universe. It is not at all clear that it is doing that. Nor is it at all clear that the New Testament authors were tying themselves to any particular cosmology. Paul once spoke of being "caught up to the third heaven" when he was describing a visionary experience (2 Cor 12.2). But this was not a journey to another place in a distant part of the universe. Rather, in the context, it was a translation to a different order of existence.</p><p>The Ascension cannot be so easily dismissed. As the former Archbishop of Canterbury and distinguished biblical scholar, Michael Ramsey, put it: "there is nothing incredible in an event whereby Jesus assured the disciples that the appearances were ended and that his sovereignty and his presence must henceforth be sought in new ways."</p><p>The Ascension was a decisive and deliberate withdrawal from sight of Jesus. And there was something gradual about it. It was not like the sudden disappearance of Christ on the Emmaus Road. Some find that easier to believe. C.S.Lewis put it like this:</p><p>if the spectators say they saw first a short vertical movement and then a vague luminosity (that is what "cloud" presumably means here as it certainly does in the account of the Transfiguration) and then nothing - have we any reason to object?</p><p>And "clouds" feature in the Second Coming of Jesus. But why?</p><p><br><strong>The Parousia</strong></p><p>The "cloud" in the Bible was often a symbol of the divine presence. In the days of Moses a "cloud" was above the tent of meeting. It was a visible sign to Israel that the glory of the Lord was there (Ex 40.34). Also a "cloud" featured in the transfiguration of Jesus: "a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: 'This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!'" (Mk 9.7). So when Jesus described his own Second Coming as a "coming in clouds with great power and glory" (Mk 13.26), it would have been understood as referring to his own divine glory. </p><p>However, the Second Coming of Jesus will be more than just a "reversal" of the Ascension.</p><p>The Ascension was private and seen just by Jesus' disciples. The Second Coming will be, in some way, public. Revelation 1.7 says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And the Second Coming will not only be publicly "visible" but also triumphant. The Greek word in the New Testament often used for the Second Coming is Parousia. That can be the official term for the visit of a person of high rank, especially a king or emperor, visiting a province. This idea may well be behind "the trumpet" mentioned several times in the New Testament:</p><p>We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed - in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed (1 Cor 15.51).</p><p>The trumpet suggests the heralding of a royal visitor or the noise that would go with a royal welcome. "But how helpful is this? There can't, surely, be a literal trumpet?" another person asks. </p><p><br><strong>Picture Language</strong></p><p>We must talk about "picture language" (or analogies or metaphors). We have to use picture language to talk not only about the Second Coming but also about life after death, judgment and Heaven and Hell. But that doesn't mean that what is referred to, or what stands behind that language, is not real and true.</p><p>Our human language and human concepts are designed for this world of space and time. To describe what happened at, before or beyond "the beginning" or "the end" requires picture language (or analogies). But that does not mean we are describing a fantasy. It is describing something that is real. Christians have always been aware of this. So Augustine of Hippo (354 - 430 AD) writing about the fact that Christ is now seated at God's right hand in Heaven, says of that "sitting":</p>
<blockquote><div>the expression indicates not a posture of the members, but judicial power, which majesty never fails to possess.</div></blockquote>
<p>We, therefore, are not the first people to recognise there are problems. But Augustine would never have been in doubt as to what Christ was now doing. He would never have said: "I don't know". For he knew that Christ was sitting at the right hand of God. True, the only way he could talk was to use the picture language of the Bible. But so what?</p><p>It is the same with the Second Coming. Some picture language may be required, such as the "trumpet" and the "shout". But that does not affect the reality referred to. The reality of a situation or event is not affected by the kind of language used to describe it. To be hesitant about the reality of what is claimed when using picture language is something like asking someone "what happens at dawn?" And they then reply: "I don't know; all I can do is use pre-Copernican picture language and say 'the sun rises.'"</p><p>That is not being clever. It just shows someone is incapable of using language. What happens in the morning, is that the sun does rise. There is an objective event that happens for everyone in a given area. We may think that this pre-Copernican picture language can be misunderstood. Today we say that the earth goes round the sun and not vice-versa. But as we know, this picture language is usually capable of communicating, given our limitations - namely that we are on earth and not out in space. When Christ returns we will then see how appropriate the language will have been.</p><p><br><strong>The events</strong></p><p>Christ has promised to return. We should not be embarrassed about taking his promise seriously. Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am </em>(John 14.3).</div></blockquote>
<p>He spoke of a personal return. Whatever else it may or may not be, there will be a relationship established between Christ and all true believers; and salvation will be completed. It will be comparable to two parties meeting and "seeing" each other. It will not just be a "spiritual" event. So Paul says: "When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory" (Col 3.4).</p><p>But Jesus will not only end history, raise the dead and judge the world. His Second Coming will result in a reconstructed universe. Again Paul writes:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 19 The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. 20 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 21 that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God</em> (Rom 8.18-21).</div></blockquote>
<p>So what will happen between now and Christ's Second Coming? Generally where the New Testament predicts, it seems to be pointing to principles, characters and happenings that can be embodied more than once. We do not have single identifiable dates, except possibly the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD (Lk 21.20). Jesus says there will be the preaching of the gospel in the Gentile world (Mat 24:14); somehow Jews will be brought to faith in Christ (Rom 11:25-29); and there will be false prophets and false Christs and antichrists (Mat 24:5). Paul says that there will also be apostasy from the faith, difficult times for the faithful and "the man of lawlessness":</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction </em>(2 Thess 2.3).</div></blockquote>
<p>None of this, however, gives us grounds for predicting the date of Christ's return. Jesus said you can't predict the date: "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father" (Mk 13.32). Hence the folly of various people that try to make predictions.</p><p><br><strong>Down the Centuries</strong></p><p>What, as a matter of fact, have Christians down the centuries said about this period between the two comings of Jesus?</p><p>In the first century Jesus made it clear that he would return, but his coming could be delayed and so Christians might first die. But that caused problems for some. The New Testament talks about "scoffers" who will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation" (2 Pet 3.4).</p><p>The reply to that was: "But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. {9} The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance" (2 Pet 3.8-9). God's time frame is not ours.</p><p>Then in the second and third centuries there were varied views among Christians. Some believed in a final climax to world history with a general resurrection and judgment. Others spoke of an earthly reign of Jesus Christ for a 1000 years first (the "millennium" referred to in the book of Revelation ch 10); this millennium would follow the Second Coming and happen before the "end".</p><p>But in the fourth century Augustine argued that it made more sense of the Bible to interpret the "millennium" as already having begun. He thus equated the "millennium" with the whole age of the church. He believed too that the verses in Revelation that spoke of further manifestations of evil would be fulfilled at the close of the millennium. Augustine's teaching became mainstream. Among other things this meant that as the year 1000 AD drew near, it was widely (and nervously) believed that the close of world history was at hand! Such a view failed to see that the "1000 years" of the book of Revelation must only be taken symbolically. They stand for a "long period".</p><p>Jumping the centuries to the 16th century - many of the Reformers believed that they were in the middle of the final conflict because of their fight against the Pope. They saw him as the "Anti-Christ". </p><p>Others since then have identified other figures as the Anti-Christ - Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol-Pot have all been possible candidates. But it may never be possible to identify categorically any given historical figure as the Anti-Christ. Rather figures in history may need to be seen as embodying the symbolism and the symbolic characters of the book of Revelation. It is always an open question at the time as to whether any contemporary Godless, anti-Christian tyrant who is persecuting the faithful is only a precursor to the final Anti-Christ or the Anti-Christ himself.</p><p><br><strong>"Watch!"</strong></p><p>Whatever is going to happen between the two Comings of Christ, the response Christians should have to the fact of Christ's return is simple. It is to watch. Here is Jesus teaching in Mark 13:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>32 No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 33 Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come 34 It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. 35 "Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back - whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. 36 If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. 37 What I say to you, I say to everyone: "Watch!</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Nor does "watching" mean just waiting and doing nothing. First, we need to trust and follow Jesus Christ. Then there is clearly the need to watch out for opportunities of service; but also, says Jesus, to watch out for temptation: "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation" (Mk 14.38). We should, indeed, live each day as if it were our last. If Christ returns and we are unprepared, he taught it would be a fearful disaster (Mat 24.36-51).</p><p>The return of Christ for those who are alive will have the same significance as death has for those who die before it happens. Lord Shaftesbury in the last century tried consciously to remember the return of Christ everyday. It did not lead to an other-worldliness. Rather it was a motive for his remarkable humanitarian work. For him it helped in living a "holy and godly life".</p><p>So let Peter have the last word:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. {11} Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives </em>(2 Pet 3.10-11).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Jesus Christ the only Way or Multi-Faithism?">(January 1999) Jesus Christ the only Way or Multi-Faithism?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 1999</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>In the United Kingdom 60-70 per cent of the population think of themselves as "Christian". Only 3 or 4 per cent think of themselves as belonging to another faith. We are not a "multi-faith" society. But many think we are. And they want "multi-faithism" in our schools, and, yes, some want it in our churches. Why?<br><br><br><b>Background</b><br><br>At the beginning of the 19th century Schleiermacher, a German liberal theologian, taught that there is reservoir of "world spirituality" that all the religions tap into. Then later, at the turn of the century, the "History of Religions School" of theologians tried not only to map out the religions of the world but to synthesize them. And today, since the nineteen sixties, it has been fashionable, especially in the Roman Catholic Church, to say that God's grace is given through non-Christian religions and even through atheism. Karl Rahner, a famous Roman Catholic theologian, talks about "anonymous Christians" in other religions.<br><br>So you now often have a "concentric model" of religions - an idea that has spread from the Roman Catholics, where the Roman Catholic Church forms the centre circle; then a little further out are other Christian churches; beyond that is a circle of other theists; beyond that a circle of various animistic and non-theistic religions; then on the far edge are secularists with no religion at all. It seems so reasonable. But are people to be measured by their "religious" nearness to, or distance from, a "religious" centre? Was the Pharisee or the tax-collector nearer to Jesus? The Pharisee, no doubt could claim a range of religious experiences. He was committed to "fasting" - a tried and tested adjunct of religious experience. But it was the tax-collector who went down to his house "justified".<br><br><br><b>Background</b><br><br>Raymond Panikkar, another Roman Catholic, has argued that if you are truly tolerant of others, you will not critically evaluate them. But this is to equate tolerance with indifferentism. There is a commonly held but mistaken view that tolerating a belief or a religion is primarily a matter of not making a judgment about the content of that belief. That is not the case. Rather tolerance involves living with something or someone about which you have a negative, or very negative, opinion or negative judgment but without redress to the law. There can be discussion, friendship, and mutual action in non-controversial areas, but not a suspension of opinion or judgment. This is so important. Let me give you a humanist, non-Christian, writer on this very point - Professor Bernard Crick:<br><br>Reacting against the religious disputes of the seventeenth century, toleration both as a state policy and an educated attitude began to spread in Britain in the eighteenth century. But let us remember one essential thing about tolerance. It arises because people do differ on fundamental and important things, but wish to limit the practical effect of their differences. Tolerance is not complete acceptance, still less permissiveness; it is modified disapproval.<br><br><br><b>Fundamental theology</b><br><br>The claim to the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ is a truth claim and, therefore, a question of fact. That is why all claims cannot be right. Here's how one Christian theologian has put matters:<br><br>Islam says Jesus wasn't crucified. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Judaism says Jesus was not the Messiah. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Hinduism says that God has often been incarnate. We say only once. And we can't both be right. Buddhism says that the world's miseries will end when we do what's right. We say, you can't do what's right: the world's miseries will end when we believe what is right. The fact is that the world's religions may agree about the peripheral matters but they disagree precisely about the most important matters of all. Any intelligent person could decide that all religions are wrong. Any intelligent person could decide that one is right and the rest wrong. But no intelligent person can seriously believe that all religions are essentially the same.<br><br>That, of course, is to go against the grain of the modern view. Today we have been conditioned to believe that all truth is relative. What we must fear from absolutism, it is said, is not error but intolerance. So the cardinal virtue is "openness". But you can't be open over what is fact and what is fiction. And the Christian faith is talking about a "gospel" or "good news" - about what God has done in history. Is that fact or fiction? That question cannot be side-lined.<br><br><br><b>The Old and New Testaments</b><br><br>Let me now spell out five of the theological reasons why faith in Jesus Christ as the only way is incompatible with multi-faithism.<br><br>First, what we read of the world's religions in the Bible is so often negative. When Paul was having an afternoon off in Athens and saw the evidence of other religions in the city, he didn't think about the possibilities of inter-faith worship. No! "he was greatly distressed" (Acts 17.16) and he ended up trying to convert the Athenians. And 1 Corinthians 8-10 is essential reading for his theology on these matters.<br><br>Secondly, of course, God can choose whom he likes to receive his grace. Melchizedek and Jethro in the Old Testament come to mind as two unlikely characters outside the ancient covenant community. But there is no suggestion that their "religions" could in any way be alternative to the covenant revealed to Abraham and through him to Moses. In the New Testament the Wise Men received divine guidance, but there is no suggestion that they were saved by their own religion. In fact God brought them to worship Jesus. <br><br>Later in the New Testament we read that Cornelius' prayers were heard by God; so Peter concluded that "God accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right" (Acts 10.35). But Cornelius himself said, under divine prompting, that "salvation" required more than those prayers: it required the preaching and the message of Peter (Acts 11.14). Clearly preparation for faith occurs outside the community of the people of God. There was also the Ethiopian eunuch (and many today in the 20th century). But the fact is that in whatever way God meets with people in other religious (or secular) settings, the Bible gives us no grounds for saying there is full salvation apart from acknowledging Christ. Religions (or secular philosophies) may play a part in helping to identify needs. But there is no salvation except in the name of Jesus Christ "for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4.12). This is not "anonymous Christianity" at all.<br><br><br><b>General and special revelation: common and saving grace</b><br><br>Thirdly, we must note that confusion comes through failing to distinguish the Holy Spirit's dual work - in creation and universal history on the one hand, and in redemption and salvation history on the other. Ever since the Reformation there has been a tendency in the West to make "redemption" from sin everything and to ignore "creation". The result is that God's work then gets assumed to be always and only "redemptive", even when what he is doing is "creative". Of course, he is engaged in redemptive work for, in and with the person of Christ and through the preaching of the gospel; that is his great work. But the great danger of ignoring sin, and so the need for redemption, must not obscure the other danger of ignoring God's creative activity.<br><br>Traditional categories are helpful here. We must distinguish between "general revelation" that comes, for example, in nature and "special revelation" in Christ and the bible; and between "common grace" that favours all alike - after all God makes his sun to shine and his rain to fall on everyone - and "saving grace" seen supremely in the Cross. Much of the inter-faith confusion, I believe, comes because general revelation is seen to be special and common grace is seen to be saving. <br><br>Fourthly, confusion also can come, and a position of uncritical openness adopted, because of the way religion is identified so often with culture. We may, indeed, want to affirm elements of another culture that is shaped by a non-Christian religion while at the same time being critical of some cultural baggage in Western Christianity. That is not the same, however, as affirming the truth of that other system of belief and worship. The bottom line has to be for the Christian that nobody comes to the Father but through Christ (John 14.6). <br><br>Fifthly, what Christians have taught down the centuries is not that God's common grace is never experienced in other religious (or secular) contexts; nor that general revelation is never heeded in other religious (or secular) contexts. But it assumes the recorded remarks of Jesus that his Father seeks "true worshippers" (John 4.23) and so worship should not only be in spirit but also in truth.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="When Private is Public">(February 1999) When Private is Public</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 1999</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Gresham's Law</b><br><br>There are some lines of Alexander Pope that bear repeating:</p>

<blockquote><div>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,As to be hated needs but to be seen;Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,We first endure, then pity, then embrace.</div></blockquote>

<p>We are now "embracing" vice - sexual vice - at such a speed and with too little opposition. Our public culture is becoming a veritable sink. In January 1999 the adulteries of Labour MPs and Prince Charles, the gay sex and drugs of a Tory MEP, the age of consent, and pornography on Channel 5 have all been issues.<br><br>What should alarm everyone (not only Christians) is the evidence that a sexual free-for-all erodes the public good and destroys social cohesion. Since the 1960's there has been what Irving Kristol calls a cultural "Gresham's Law".<br><br>Gresham's Law can work for books or theatre as efficiently as it does for coinage - driving out the good, establishing the debased. The cultural market in the U.S. today is being preempted by dirty books, dirty movies, dirty theatre. A pornographic novel has a far better chance of being published today than a non-pornographic one, and quite a few pretty good novels are not being published at all simply because they are not pornographic, and are therefore less likely to sell. Our cultural condition has not improved as the result of the new freedom.<br><br>But this debasing of the culture goes with deeper social consequences. A society without sexual restraint soon sees the disintegration of marriage and the married-family. And that has happened. In the UK we are now the divorce capital of Europe and we have the worst teenage pregnancy rate in the Western World. And there are, of course, sad results for children. On average children do better in terms of life-chances, education, health and employment with two parents of the opposite sex committed together for life than others do in alternative family arrangements. That is admitted by the majority of serious social scientists and analysts.<br><br><br><b>Sex and Culture</b><br><br>However, there are wider cultural and societal effects. J.D.Unwin's researches published as long ago as 1934 by the Oxford University Press under the title Sex and Culture still need to be heeded. Professor V.A.Demant's summarizes the arguments:<br><br>His [Unwin's] conclusion, reached after a review of many societies and civilizations, is that when social regulations forbid indiscriminate satisfaction of the sexual impulses, the emotional conflict is expressed in another way; and that what we call civilization has been built up by sacrifices in the gratification of innate desires. "A greater or lesser mental development has accompanied a limitation or extension of sexual opportunity." Unwin correlates three types of religion with three kinds of society described by their sexual regulations. "Societies that permitted pre-nuptial freedom were in the zoistic condition and produced little culture beyond tribal survival. Societies that imposed an irregular or occasional continence were in the manistic condition: these have a more elaborate social system. Societies that enforced complete pre-nuptial continence were in the deistic condition, and these have the maximum of intellectual and creative energy. He deduces that the greatest social energy and impulse for civilisation-building is a correlate of the strictest of sexual patterns, namely that of absolute monogamy and extra-marital continence (V.A.Demant, An Exposition of Christian Sex Ethics p100 ff).<br><br>Whether that is the best or only way of categorizing societies and religions can be debated. But the basic claim that sexual restraint is correlated with cultural health stands, and would seem to be self-evidently true. A society where marriage norms have been destroyed and where pure sexual gratification is a primary value is not a society that can motivate communal effort. Nor will many of its members want to make sacrifices for such a society.<br><br>E.J.Mishan once wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>Can anyone care very much what happens to a society whose members are continually and visibly obsessed with sexual carousal - to a society where, in effect, the human animal has been reduced to a life-style that consists in the main activity of alternatively inflaming itself and relieving itself?</div></blockquote>

<p>But that life-style is now endorsed by some in the media, education and politics.<br><br><br><b>Tony Blair and Robin Cook</b><br><br>On January 10 Tony Blair told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost that he gave his full backing to Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, whose ex-wife had made allegations about his sexual [mis-]behaviour from her personal experience. He described Robin Cook as "the most respected foreign minister in the rest of Europe that we've had for years and years and years". The Prime Minister also said that "if you go through any big corporation employees had problems in their private lives that did not affect the way they carried out their jobs." He asked to be judged not on "scandal, gossip and trivia" but "judge us on the things that really matter."<br><br>That was more than I could cope with. Whatever the truth about his former marriage, Robin Cook, on his own admission, while still married to his ex-wife considered appointing Gaynor Regan, his new wife, as diary secretary, at a time when the world did not know she was his mistress. Eventually, of course, he divorced his wife, apparently under pressure from Labour spin-doctors. Undoubtedly his former wife gives only one side to the story; nor is it edifying to trawl through sordid private misfortunes and sins, certainly not at second hand. But some comment had to be made. So I wrote the following letter to The Times. It was published on January 13:<br><br>In supporting Robin Cook (report, January 11), Tony Blair seemed to dismiss the issues relating to the private life of his Foreign Secretary as "scandal, gossip and trivia". The Prime Minister wanted to get back to "the things that really matter."<br><br>But the break-up of marriage and the marriage-based family does "really matter". Even if you ignore the private human damage, there are public exchequer costs. According to Government estimates the annual "costs to the public purse of marital breakdown" are a staggering £5 billion (Research Paper 96/42 p74), and that excludes all hidden costs. Surely it does "really matter" that £5 billion is not potentially available for the current National Health Service crisis, or for education.<br><br>The sexual immoralities and marriage failures of public figures who should set public standards are a proper public concern. They cannot be dismissed as "trivia". They call for repentance. Lord Nolan, the Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, when interviewed soon after Tony Blair took office, said:</p>

<blockquote><div>Of all the behaviour which in my personal experience has caused the greatest misery to other human beings, I would put adultery pretty high on the list. I don't actually think you can expect a man with the strains of public life to perform adequately unless he has got a good home life to go back to.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Enough is enough</b><br><br>As Christians what should we do? Of course, we must tell people publicly and privately about forgiveness. We must explain that Jesus Christ died for all sins, sexual sins included. King David in the Old Testament was a classic case of a sexual sinner (and a murderer) who repented, was forgiven, but, of course, he still had to face the practical consequences of his folly. Nor can any be "holier than thou". All of us must say, "there but for the grace of God go I".<br><br>Nevertheless, in our public culture today, surely Christians have to insist on a return to public standards on the part of those in public positions. When a head teacher has an adulterous affair with a staff member, breaks up their marriage and all the school knows, should not he, or she, resign? What an example to the children! When MPs or MEPs behave like some have been doing here in the North East recently - homosexually and heterosexually - should they too not resign? Can you trust someone in public who you cannot trust in private? John Profumo, the Tory MP had an affair with the prostitute Christine Keeler and brought down the Macmillan government in the 1960's. He did the honest thing. He resigned, repented and then led a life of great usefulness in charitable work. Nor should we be impressed by the argument that a moral test would mean few would pass it. This century politics have become so sleazy that good men and women undoubtedly have been, and are being, deterred from entering political life. It is again a case of Gresham's Law.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Letter from America">(March 1999) Letter from America</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 1999</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>In the manner of the BBC's inimitable Alistair Cooke a number try their hand at a "Letter from America". Here is my offering after a short visit to the United States in mid-February and in the wake of the impeachment acquittal of President Clinton.<br><br><br><b>Moral renaissance</b><br><br>Currently there are two important stories in this economically successful nation - one is about moral decadence, but a second is about signs of a moral renaissance. I shall begin with the second story.<br><br>As in Europe many Christians in the US and even non-Christian commentators have documented, with varying degrees of despair, the moral decline since the 1960's - soaring crime, teenage pregnancies, an abortion tidal wave, rising fatherlessness, ruined cities and ruined schools.<br><br>But now some are celebrating signs of change. So Karl Zinsmeister writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>very recently, some remarkable and encouraging developments have taken place. Many of the social trend lines that turned ugly in the 60's and 70's have begun to level off and even retreat, in many cases to their lowest levels in two or three decades.</div></blockquote>

<p>And there is a change in attitude. Many are now edging their way back to what has been described as "tradition, moderation, and sanity." Also importantly strong majorities now place "reversing moral decline" as their highest priority for the nation, higher than any economic, foreign, or other domestic issue. Now 62 percent think that "a let-down in moral values" is one of the "major causes of our problems today." And to the question: "which worries you more - that the country will become too tolerant of behaviours that are bad for society or that the country will become too intolerant of behaviours that don't do any real harm to society?" While 6 percent have no opinion, 66 percent say they are more worried by too much tolerance; only 28 percent by too much intolerance.<br><br>For some time there has been a general awareness that the US murder rate is less than that in some areas of Europe (such as in Holland); and also that in some areas like New York zero-tolerance policing has had a profound effect. Today it is one of the safest cities in the US after being one of the worst. <br><br>It is only now, however, that publicity is being given to these other facts - that in America the divorce rate is down 19 percent since 1981; the birth rate for unmarried teenagers is down 7.5 percent since 1994; abortion is down 15.3 percent since 1990; and even crime is down.<br><br>It was General Douglas MacArthur who once wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>history fails to record a single precedent in which nations subject to moral decay have not passed into a political and economic decline. There has either been a spiritual awakening to overcome the moral lapse, or a progressive deterioration to ultimate national disaster.</div></blockquote>

<p>So it is a reasonable question to ask whether God's hand is in this turn around. For it follows the work of Christians in the 1980's and 1990's who both evangelised and, often against the odds and in the face of much abuse, stood up in the Public Square for biblical truth and biblical standards.<br><br><br><b>Moral decadence</b><br><br>But there is another story. The concerns of the general public are one thing. Those of the cultural elites that control education and the media are quite another. In some ways America is sicker than ever. Princeton University, we are told, recently offered an Ethics chair to a philosopher who "defends infanticide and argues against making moral distinctions between humans and fleas." And there has just been produced the first mainstream Hollywood film presenting a sympathetic view of paedophilia - Todd Solondz' Happiness.<br><br>Then there is Bill Clinton and his sexual saga. All now know that Clinton lied. "The dress" proved he was lying when he pointed his finger at a TV camera and said to the US nation, and the world, that he did not have sex with "that woman ... Miss Lewinsky [a girl the age of his daughter]." What, however, has surprised many commentators are the people who stood by Clinton. These were, says Danielle Crittenden, the very "people you thought would be shocked - feminists, soccer moms, little old ladies." And the sad result of that, according to Dennis Prager, a radio show host, is that ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... millions of American men have now been told that millions of American women do not view extra-marital sex as particularly troubling. UCLA psychiatrist Dr. Stephen Marmer told me that some of his male patients have said that thanks to women's passionate support of Clinton, they feel much freer to fool around.</div></blockquote>

<p>So what has been going on? How does this fit in with a moral renaissance?<br><br><br><b>Dr James Dobson</b><br><br>Dr James Dobson, the Christian paediatrician and founder of Focus on the Family talks about a "barrage of sound bites designed to deny, mislead, and confuse the public." He says since the spring and summer of 1998 the media's "spin" has manipulated the public and tried to intimidate the Congress. Americans, he says, were told almost every day some of the following:<br><br>Paula Jones is lying; Paula Jones is white trash; Linda Tripp has broken the law; Ken Starr has wasted $40 million of our tax dollars; if we were to impeach members of Congress for infidelity there wouldn't be anyone left in Washington; this is just a witch-hunt by Ken Starr; it's a private matter that's none of our business; it's just about sex; Congress should get back to the nation's business; I (the President) have to get back to doing the job the American people asked me to do; everyone does it; and finally when the facts became undeniable, this offence doesn't rise to the level of impeachment; the American people want this ended; the American people don't care; the American people think Clinton has done a wonderful job; the American people voted for Clinton twice and now Congress wants to overturn the election.<br><br>All this was in sharp contrast, argues Dobson, to what happened two years earlier when there was an attempt to overturn the President's veto of a bill to ban partial-birth abortions - abortions of un-anaesthetized, late-term babies described as "murder during delivery". This failed by nine votes (and it failed again in 1998). But the public were not constantly told then in 1996 on Radio and TV that 71 percent wanted their legislators to prohibit late-term abortions. The media were not using poll data then to show that the President had defied the will of the people! And it is the same with a number of other issues, he says. For example, 72 percent want school choice.<br><br>James Dobson's conclusion is that "considering the effectiveness of the spin machine these past 13 months, it is remarkable that Republicans in the House had the courage to stand on their principles."<br><br><br><b>Chuck Coulson</b><br><br>The cultural elites in the US (as in the UK) - and that includes those who control the media - according to the polling data are considerably more permissive morally than the generality of the public. But as these elites shape public values, you now have the situation of apparent public support for immorality while privately there is more opposition. For example, 70 percent of modern men think that homosexual sex is always or nearly always wrong. But a significant number think that it is wrong to give expression to that view in public and others that it should never be mandated as a principle for others. Morality, it is felt, is something very private. It is irrelevant in the Public Square. Such has been the persuasiveness of the cultural elites. So US legislators, as in the UK, support sexual deviancy while most think it wrong. Such are the times in which we live.<br><br>Some Christians are getting weary and depressed. But Chuck Coulson, the converted former Nixon aide of Watergate fame, says, "No!" Now is not the time to throw in the towel. He not only is encouraged by these new statistics suggesting moral change. He also believes that the 21st century presents Christians with a new opportunity. He notes the failure of the 20th century's idols - its ideologies - "communism, socialism, nazism, liberalism, humanism, scientism ... The only remaining "ism" is post-modernism, which is not an ideology but a repudiation of all ideologies. Its relativism is the admission that every attempt to construct a comprehensive, utopian world-view has failed. It is a formalized expression of despair. Only one compelling claim to transcendent truth remains, one secure hope: Christianity."<br><br>That is why Chuck Coulson on this point agrees with John Paul II who is claiming that the year 2000 will usher in "a great springtime for Christianity."<br><br>Not all Americans agree. There are still doom merchants. But there are significant signs of hope.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="'The One Disconcerting Fact" - the Empty Tomb">(April 1999) "The One Disconcerting Fact" - the Empty Tomb</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 1999</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>The following is an extract (p 70ff) from the book "Where did Jesus Go? - The truth and meaning of the Resurrection" by DRJH.</i><br><br><br><b>The empty tomb</b><br><br>Some say that the early Christians themselves did not really believe in an empty tomb. All the stories about the empty tomb have been concocted late in the day and then inserted by the Gospel writers into their accounts. Paul, it is said, didn't believe in the empty tomb. He thought the bones of Jesus were still in the grave. The idea of a "bodily" Resurrection was a late addition, superimposed on an earlier "spiritual" resurrection tradition.<br><br>Others say the tomb was empty, but not because of the Resurrection, but because Joseph of Arimathea had removed the body; or Jesus had not really died - he had only swooned; or the women had gone to the wrong tomb; or even the disciples had stolen the body. This last was one of the first "alternative" hypotheses. It is mentioned in the New Testament (Matt 28.13). Another early "alternative" was, according to Tertullian, "the theory that the gardener of the tomb removed the body of Jesus and placed it elsewhere to protect his lettuces from the spectators!"<br><br>What can be said in reply to these suggestions? First, why on earth would the early Christians have wanted to create an "empty tomb" tradition? Had they wanted to do that, they would, surely, have made it fit in better with Jewish expectations of "resurrection". These were more in the way of a "resuscitation" - a restoration to normal human life as before, not a true resurrection.<br><br>And if Jesus' resurrection was "spiritual" only, why did they not say so? When the disciples saw the risen Jesus, we are told, they thought he was a "spirit" (Luke 24.37). If he had only been that, why deny it? Such a "positive" apparition of a "spiritual Jesus" could have made them revise their ideas about the "spiritual world". Jesus had made them revise a number of cherished ideas during his early ministry. Why should he not now be making them revise their ideas about this? If Jesus was now a spirit, why not say so?<br><br>The fact of the matter is that the earliest strata of the Gospel tradition makes it clear that the risen Jesus was believed to have flesh and bones!<br><br>It is then said that the early Christians created these empty tomb stories to counter Gnostic and docetic tendencies: the Gnostics and Docetics said that matter was bad and Jesus was "separate" from matter.<br><br>But why counter these views? They come easily enough to many people. There would be no reason for countering them unless there was something that led the early Christians to say that they were wrong! The belief that Jesus had a resurrection body would be one of the key factors in convincing the early Christians that matter was good. It was not bad.<br><br>But did Paul believe that the bones of Jesus were still in the tomb? The argument is that in the first epistle to the Corinthians chapter fifteen he says only that "Christ died ... he was buried, that he was raised" (verse 3-4). He doesn't explicitly mention Jesus leaving the tomb.<br><br>However, that is pure pedantry. It is clear that "what was raised on the third day" was "that which died and was buried" - the body of Jesus. "The natural implication would be that the resurrection was, so to speak, the reversal of the entombment" (C.H.Dodd). True it was a "glorified" body. But Paul is quite clear that such a body came about not by leaving the old body to rot and having a new body, but by a "change" of the old body. When he refers to the believer at the last day, he says this: "We will not all sleep (i.e. some, not all, will go to their graves first), but we will all (the dead and the living) be changed" (1 Cor 15.51). As he believes that the resurrection of Jesus was the "first fruits" of the resurrection of every believer, we must assume he saw the resurrection of the believer and the resurrection of Jesus as similar. We must assume, therefore, he believed that Jesus body changed.<br><br>Further, if the tomb was not empty, why didn't someone produce the body? This point has been made so many times but has never yet been satisfactorily answered. Professor D.M.Mackinnon speaks of "the inability of the opponents of the early Christian preaching to silence the message of the Resurrection once for all by producing Christ's remains."<br><br>One other point - why, oh why, if the empty tomb was being devised for "apologetic" purposes late in the day, were the majority of witnesses to the tomb said to be women? Why weren't the witnesses of the empty tomb made to be men and Apostles at that? In Jewish law the witness of women was discounted.<br><br>You cannot escape the empty tomb. Geza Vermes, a Jewish biblical scholar, wrote an article in the Observer Colour Supplement on "The Mystery Tomb". He is not friendly to the Christian account of things, but he has to admit "the one disconcerting fact - namely that the women who set out to pay their last respects to Jesus found not a body but an empty tomb." C.H.Dodd again sums it up well: "When they (the early Christians) said 'He rose from the dead,' they took it for granted that his body was no longer in the tomb: if the tomb had been visited it would have been found empty. The Gospels supplement this by saying, it was visited, and it was found empty."<br><br><br><b>The tomb was empty, but ...</b><br><br>It needs to be admitted that the early Christians did not base their belief in the Resurrection on the empty tomb. In fact they often seemed to have played it down. It was not the main plank of their early preaching, although it is implied by it.<br><br>Negative evidence is of doubtful value; and the empty tomb is negative evidence. So it is not surprising to read in Mark that the women who discovered the tomb to be empty "said nothing to anyone" (16.8). Luke tells us that the other disciples treated the story of the empty tomb "like nonsense" (24.11).<br><br>The main reason why the disciples believed that Jesus had risen was that they saw him alive after his death. The empty tomb enabled them to understand a little of what actually they had seen. They hadn't just seen "visions".<br><br>But what serious alternative explanation of the empty tomb can you give? And remember all four Gospels admit to it. Remember, too, there are Semiticisms that show the accounts come from early Palestinian sources. How can you then account for the "emptiness" other than by the Resurrection?<br><br>Two hundred years ago Venturini tried to say that Jesus had never really died. The wounds of the Crucifixion merely made him "swoon". By mistake he was taken down from the cross too early before he had really expired.<br><br>This view ignored the evidence of John's Gospel that says measures were taken to make sure death had occurred. To continue to hold such a view today ignores the powerful criticism of D.F.Strauss (1808-74), a theologian who himself denied most of Christianity! But he showed the impossibility of someone who had gone through the horrors of crucifixion giving rise to "Resurrection" faith. A poor, dehydrated creature, racked with pain and requiring enormous care and attention to help survive could not, he argued, have generated such a belief.<br><br>But nothing daunted, Hugh Schonfield tried a modern version of this in The Passover Plot. He there tries to say that Jesus intended to fake death. He wanted a mock "sacrificial" death. He planned that collaborators should help him back to life. Unfortunately he hadn't banked on the "spear-thrust", so everything misfired. He may have revived for a short time, during which period an unknown person took messages from the dying Jesus to the disciples. This person was mistaken for Jesus. Hence the belief in the Resurrection.<br><br>All that can be said for this view is that it made Dr Schonfield's book a "million-copy best-seller"! That is on the cover of my edition. It is sheer fantasy. As J.N.D.Anderson pointed out, there is no suggestion "as to why the unknown messenger was mistaken for Jesus himself, why the conspirators never told the apostles what really happened, or what, indeed, would have been the outcome of this fantastic plot if it had succeeded." Frank Morrison called the "swoon-type" theories "really little more than an historical curiosity". But Hugh Schonfield shows that they have, for one reason or another, a certain persistence. They theory owe their strength to the evidence that the tomb was empty.<br><br>Earlier than Venturini, Hermann Reimarus put forward an even more bizarre theory. He said that the disciples had done quite well out of Jesus ministry. They had been able to live off it as a sort of "hippie band". "What a pity," they said, "if we have to give all this up" - or words to that effect. They did not fancy the more routine life of a fisherman or tradesman. So they stole the body of Jesus, hid it and told everyone that one day he would return! This enabled them to carry on as before. Beasley-Murray has said it all: "Suggestions of this kind are nothing less than contemptible." People will lie to make money; but they will not lie to die. We are asked to believe the disciples were prepared to be martyred for a lie.<br><br>But could someone else have stolen the body? Why? And how was the body concealed when all Jerusalem was talking about the Resurrection and the Jewish leaders wanted the body. The evidence of Judas' dealings with the chief priests shows that there was money to be made from co-operating with them (Luke 22.5).<br><br>Kirsopp Lake put forward another idea. The women went to the wrong tomb. They found a young man who most helpfully said: "he is not here [in this tomb]; see the place where they laid him." Professor Lake adds, he "probably pointed to the next tomb. But the women were frightened at the detection of their errand and fled." Some days later they assumed, in the light of what the Apostles told them, that they had been to the right tomb.<br><br>But Kirsopp Lake doctors or ignores the evidence. He bases what he says on Mark alone and then misses out crucial words. For Mark says the "young man ... in a white robe" said to the women: "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him (Mark 16.6). The other Gospels say the Apostles went to check on the tomb. Again, why didn't the Jewish authorities go themselves and explore and find the right tomb? They could have produced the body to silence things once and for all.<br><br>That they didn't, argues against the Jewish authorities themselves ever moving the body. Yet did Joseph of Arimathea do so? If he did and if he was a secret disciple, as the New Testament says (John 19.38), why didn't he tell the other disciples? If he was a Jewish plant, why didn't he tell the Jewish authorities?<br><br>It is important to remember that the only argument that the Jewish authorities at the time came up with was that the disciples had stolen the body. At that time they could not have realised that this would be disproved by the disciples' willingness to die for their risen Lord. At the time they must have believed this was the best they could try. Any other suggestions they knew held no water. In time the theory that the disciples had stolen the body was seen for what it was, a tissue of lies (Matt 28.12-13).<br><br><br><b>The tomb was empty, but ...</b><br><br>The resurrection faith was based more on the appearances of the risen Lord than on the empty tomb. But what were these appearances?<br><br>The earliest record of the appearances is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians chapter fifteen. This takes us back a very long way behind the Gospels. Paul was writing about 25 years after the death of Jesus, but this account was passed on to him many years before that. It looks as though it was passed on to him at the beginning of his Christian experience. He considers this to be a matter "of first importance":</p>

<blockquote><div>3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born (1 Cor 15.3-8).</div></blockquote>

<p>Paul is appealing to common knowledge. People can go and ask any of the people he has mentioned. There was Peter (Cephas), the leader in the immediate period after the Crucifixion and Resurrection. There was James, Jesus' brother. He became the leader of the Jerusalem Church when Peter moved out and about. Paul knew them both well and had spent a fortnight with Peter just a few years after the death and resurrection of Jesus. This was on his visit to Jerusalem. This is evidence very close to the events. <br><br>Something had happened. What had happened was not the occurrence of a "religious consciousness". No! People said they had seen Jesus. And it was a particular series of "seeings". They were quite unique. They were confined to a limited period. Everyone knew that at a certain point these events had come to an end. That is why Paul was so insistent that when he "saw the Lord" it was quite unexpected and abnormal, "an appendix to a series already closed" (C.H.Dodd).<br><br>One of the things that can be said with conviction about the Resurrection appearances recorded at the end of the Gospels is that they are so different from one another. But they all left those who had seen the risen Jesus with an unshakeable conviction: they had not seen a ghost or a spirit but at least a real person.<br><br>Some of the appearances are recounted in detail. We read of Mary in the garden, thinking she is seeing the gardener (John 20.15). We read of Jesus suddenly appearing to the disciples behind locked doors (John 20.19). We read of two unknown disciples walking along the road near Jerusalem with a stranger who turns out to be Jesus (Luke 24.13-31). Then he is by the lakeside in Galilee (John 21.1). These are familiar to many people. But we have no details of the appearance to James or the "more than five hundred".<br><br>How can we attempt to describe what happened? We can't. Nor could the Gospel writers with any precision. They could only record what the disciples saw and touched (or tried to touch). "In describing occurrences which ex hypothesi lay on the extreme edge of normal human experience, or beyond it, the writers are hardly to be pinned down to matter-of-fact precision in detail."<br><br><br><b>Explanation</b><br><br>"This then is where you are arguing in the dark," someone says. "We can, therefore, never say anything useful about what happened."<br><br>A lot of play is made by some people of the fact that if these events happened, they must have been "beyond history"; so the historian might as well give up talking about them. They are maters for "faith" alone, not historical argument. The historian doesn't have the tools for dealing with what is "beyond history". He has nothing to compare this sort of thing with. "It is without analogy," as they would say. It is quite unique. How can you begin to talk about something that is so unique? That is a fair question. But you don't have to be reduced to silence when something strange comes along. True, we very often do explain things by "analogy". We say that something is similar to something else, but it differs in this or that respect. We "class" it along with something else of the same "class" of things, and then we define its "differences". We explain what a Bible is, for example, by saying it is a "religious book" - its "class"; we then mark it off from other religious books by saying it is the "Christian religious book" - its "differentia", as the philosophers would say.<br><br>But you can't do that with something that is unique. It has no "analogy"; there is nothing else in history to put it alongside, or a "class" of similar things to put it in. So you can't begin to mark it off and distinguish it from other similar events, which, it is said, is the essence of any sort of explanation.<br><br>You are not then, however, reduced to silence over explaining the Resurrection (or for that matter any other unique item). For not all explanation is undertaken in the way we have just outlined.<br><br>Take a "trick" in a game of cards. How do you explain that. It is quite unique. There is no analogy. To say it is like a "goal" in a game of football, doesn't help the "explanatory process". But you are not reduced to silence. In fact you explain things perfectly well. You explain, at this point, not the "trick" so much as the whole game itself. You explain how the game is played. In the course of doing so, it becomes quite clear what a trick is.<br><br>So it is with the Resurrection. When you read the accounts, you have an idea of what is being meant. And when you read about the Resurrection in the context of the whole Bible and its view of history, you understand more fully what it means.<br><br>Yes, we may have to talk about the Resurrection in paradoxical language sometimes. But we must expect to do that in "borderland situations".<br><br>J.L.Austen, the Oxford linguistic philosopher, once drew attention to this. Here is a (far fetched) example: I turn up at your home just after a mutual friend who lives with you has dropped down dead and his corpse is still in the house. I ask, "Is he at home?" What is the answer? "He is and he isn't," - you find it difficult answering in these terms. I ask further, "What do you mean?" You then explain the sad event, and I understand. And I understand why a certain type of language doesn't fit. But if you have to speak in those terms - of "being at home" - you have to speak paradoxically: "He is both at home and not at home."<br><br>Parodox and "word failure" doesn't always imply unreality. Situations that defy language are not necessarily false or unhistorical. If the Bible is true and God is real, we will inevitably have these sorts of problems as we talk about God and his action in the world. It is unfortunate that we have to speak less clearly than we would like. This is only what you would expect if you have conceptual limitations. The Christian, though, says that one day it will all make sense:</p>

<blockquote><div>Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor 13.12).</div></blockquote>

                <p><b>Review</b><br><br>In the February 1999 Coloured Supplement I wrote this:<br><br>On January 10 Tony Blair told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost that he gave his full backing to Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, whose ex-wife had made allegations about his sexual [mis-]behaviour from her personal experience. He described Robin Cook as "the most respected foreign minister in the rest of Europe that we've had for years and years and years". The Prime Minister also said that "if you go through any big corporation employees had problems in their private lives that did not affect the way they carried out their jobs." He asked to be judged not on "scandal, gossip and trivia" but "judge us on the things that really matter."<br><br>Along with President Clinton, who I wrote about in the October 1998 Coloured Supplement in the context of "lying", these men have a responsibility for the safety not only of the West but of the entire world, such is the seriousness of the conflict in the Balkans. How have they done and how are they doing in "the things that [they think] really matter" as distinct from the "trivia" of personal morality?<br><br><br><b>Evaluation</b><br><br>Tragically there appears to have been a massive mishandling of events. Undoubtedly the Serbian dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, is pursing evil policies. Undoubtedly the general intention of the West is right. <br><br>But the strategy of bombing that was intended to stop Milosevic from causing further harm on the Kosovars, has had the opposite effect. The bombing has given Milosevic a pretext for accelerating his "ethnic cleansing". And now the conflict is being escalated as someone has said, "to maintain the credibility of those who have blundered." There have been huge miscalculations. But, as we shall see, Jesus taught that "calculation" is fundamental in deciding the rightness or wrongness of going to war.<br><br>On 3 March, well before the airstrikes on Serbia began, and before the Rambouillet talks finally failed, an editorial in The Guardian Weekly was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>The issue which can no longer be postponed is the need to consider using ground troops even if a deal is not struck. The West must draw up a sensible "entry strategy" to impose peace. Air strikes on Serbia without an early follow-up with an intervention force on the ground make little sense. Bombing is an option which seems easy because it will cost few, if any, Western lives. But bombing is a gamble. Rather than making Milosevic accept a deal, it may lead to massive reprisals against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The only way to prevent that is to show that other governments are willing to risk lives. Painful though it will be, that means sending professional troops into the "hostile environment" which no commander willingly undertakes but which the gravity of the crisis demands. If Kosovo is not to be another Bosnia, there is no other choice.</div></blockquote>

<p>President Clinton and Tony Blair (and Robin Cook) had this warning - namely that bombing, far from making Milosevic accept a deal, "may lead to massive reprisals against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo." <br><br>It has. The humanitarian crisis is dire. In that connection, Chris Richards, a member of our congregation, a consultant paediatrician at the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary is setting up in Elbasan in Albania medical provision in a refugee camp for 5000 with CORD (Christian Out-Reach and Development) at the request of the British Government. He would value our prayers.<br><br>But we also need to pray for our leaders, whatever mistakes have been made. How we need to pray that right judgments are made at this point. And above all there needs to be a clear hold on "just war" principals.<br><br><br><b>A complicated situation</b><br><br>It is, of course, a complicated situation. But it now appears that President Clinton was not present at key discussions on strategic planning meetings. Such was his distraction because of the Monica Lewinsky saga and the impeachment process. This cannot have helped the US leadership in making careful and prudent judgments in such a complicated situation.<br><br>The evil perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic is shocking. It is regularly on our TV screens. But according to the Humanitarian Law Violations in Kosovo, Human Rights Watch, 1998, the KLA has also a past record of atrocities.<br><br>There is now talk of invading Serbia to capture Belgrade and depose Milosevic. That would mean a major war in Europe. What would happen with the Russians? Already the Russian Foreign minister has described Bill Clinton and Tony Blair as playing Russian Roulette. And as he put it, "the gun is still smoking with nuclear weapons."<br><br>There are now few alternatives. A failure of what has been begun, is unthinkable. It would have a destabilising effect on other situations where leaders and groups are restrained through fear of NATO. But there is a dangerous "gung-ho" attitude evolving. The horrors of war are fearful. A new phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic seems to play down these horrors. <br><br>In the US there are successors to what have been described as the "chicken hawks", </p>

<blockquote><div>politicians (usually Republicans) who avoided military service themselves but nonetheless were hot to sacrifice other people's sons in conflicts far from home like Grenada or Iraq.</div></blockquote>

<p>According to Mona Charen, this new group were once "vitriolic haters of the war in Vietnam who cut their teeth chanting, 'Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?'" They have now been "transformed into hard-liners on Kosovo." And it is similar in the UK. Tony Blair himself opposed Mrs Thatcher over the Falklands. He first stood for Parliament as a Labour CND candidate for Beaconsfield. This does not prove these converts are necessarily now wrong. But some converts have a temptation to go to extremes. <br><br>And why the Balkans? Doug Bandow reminds us that "as many people died in January alone in Sierra Leone than in all of Kosovo last year." As an African member of our congregation has asked me, "why has not the West bombed the Sudan like it is bombing Serbia?" Far worse atrocities have been going on there since I was a missionary in that country with the CMS in the 1960's. <br><br><br><b>The Christian view of War</b><br><br>But is war ever right? What does the bible teach us about some of these things? <br><br>Is there a "Christian view of War"? Is there a "Just War?"<br><br>Article XXXVII of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England says that </p>

<blockquote><div>it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in wars.</div></blockquote>

<p>There is a clear New Testament duty to be non-resisting (Mat 5.39). But at the same time there is a duty laid on the State to be (Rom 13.4) "an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer."<br><br>In the first few centuries of the Church's life the early Christians saw the importance of both duties. They believed that as individuals they must never harm or inflict suffering on others. But at the same time they believed the [pagan] State was divinely ordained to repress crime and violence with force.<br><br>In the time of the Emperor Constantine, when the Roman Empire officially became "Christian", there was a dilemma. It was the dilemma of reconciling the love of Christ that leads to non-aggression with the need of the State to enforce justice. Suddenly some Christians found themselves in positions of political authority. <br><br>They then read Paul and found him saying in one and the same breath that individuals should not themselves "take revenge", while legitimate rulers who "bear the sword" should avenge others and enforce God's judgment on evil. And they concluded that when evil was being by perpetrated by a neighbouring state, "bearing the sword" meant war.<br><br>Of course this was a dilemma, a terrible dilemma. But many Christians, entrusted by God with political authority, felt that in good conscience they could not opt out. <br><br>And many still believe that. They realise that they have to exercise power or force in the interests of justice whether in peace time (through sentencing criminals for punishment), or in time of war.<br><br><br><b>Calculation</b><br><br>"Just War Theory" was designed to help with this dilemma. It justified war not as self-defence, but as a means of ensuring justice. The personal "turning of the other cheek" is not denied. It is rather that the political power of those seeking public justice needs to be regulated. But in such matters the difficulty is that things are not black and white. "Calculation" is needed.<br><br>Jesus claimed that cool calculation in human existence is essential in a number of situations. Indeed he argues that cool calculation should lead to a willingness to sacrifice everything for the privilege of being a Christian disciple. <br><br>But right calculation is also needed in war, together with property development. This was the subject of one of Jesus' parables:</p>

<blockquote><div>Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? 29 For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, 30 saying, 'This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.' 31 Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 32 If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. 33 In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14.28-33).</div></blockquote>

<p>The contrast in the parable shows different sorts of calculation - the one in tower-building, the other in planning a war.<br><br>In tower-building it is straightforward. There are simple costs. These can be added up mathematically. If the builder can find that precise sum of money, he will be successful.<br><br>But success in war is so different. There are no simple mathematics. The king does not just sit down and do his sums and "estimate the cost". Rather, we are told by Jesus, he has first to "sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand." Deciding about war is far less precise. <br><br>It is a matter of judgment and prudence. As many facts as can be known have to be assembled. Then a decision has to be taken in the light of these facts. But in the nature of things there will be far less certainty than in building a tower.<br><br><br><b>Just War Theory</b><br><br>This has been the difficulty for Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Robin Cook (and Madeleine Albright et al). Nothing has been certain. But because the issues are not certain or not black and white, from a Christian perspective, there must be the restraints of Just War Theory.<br><br>What is Just War Theory? It was a theory that evolved in the Church during the middle ages and the Renaissance. But it was Augustine who had provided the ground work. All else followed from his discussion on the subject. Professor Oliver O'Donovan describes the theory as<br><br>a systematic attempt to interpret acts of war by analogy with acts of civil government, not, be it noted, to afford some justification for warmaking, but to bring it under the restraint of those moral standards which apply to other acts of government.<br><br>The doctrine is limiting. It means that not all is fair in love and war. There have to be guidelines. If a war is to be fought, it has to be fought justly.<br><br>There were five basic principles in the theory. Three dealt with engaging in war and two dealt with the conduct of war. The three that deal with the right engagement in war are these. First, the responsibility for waging war is not just anybody's; rather it belongs to the legitimate authority. Secondly, the "cause" has to be just. And, thirdly, there has to be a right motive. But the two that deal with the right conduct of war are perhaps most easily forgotten. These relate first to the principle of "discrimination" and secondly to the principle of "proportion".<br><br><br><b>Discrimination and Proportion</b><br><br>"Discrimination" means that force must only be applied to combatants and with the intention of depriving them of their ability to wage war. There must be no intention to attack non-combatants. An enemy prisoner of war, unable to be violent, must therefore be treated as a non-combatant. "Total" (indiscriminate) war is obviously ruled out.<br><br>Of course, there must be a distinction drawn between the result of violent action and the intention behind it. If there is an intention to destroy a military command post or an armoured column, but the result is unforeseen civilian casualties (as happened in Kosovo with NATO accidentally bombing a refugee column), that is utterly tragic, but not wicked. However, to aim a missile indiscriminately at a centre of population with the intention of destroying civilian morale is wicked.<br><br>It is because of the principle of "discrimination" that questions were rightly raised about the attack on the Serbian TV station with the deaths of a number of innocent employees. But it would be wise for us to reserve judgment until all the facts are known. That, of course, relates to confidence in the truthfulness and honesty of leadership. And that is why private morals are so important for public life.<br><br>"Proportion" means that no more force or violence should be used than is necessary. But what is enough force is a matter for calculation and consultation. That is where Jesus' parable of "a king about to go to war" is so true to life. It is not a matter of mathematical certainty but of prudent judgment. <br><br>And the parable is a salutary reminder that some calculations mean there are occasions when you cannot conduct war, however, much you may want to. If the calculations show that you cannot win, you have to "ask for terms of peace".<br><br>But none of the calculating must ever be "cold". There is an instinct in Christian understanding that war may be right. Yet to execute someone in war (or peace) is not only horrific but defiling. It is worth remembering that just before he invaded Britain, William the Conqueror had a banner blessed by the Pope. After the battle of Hastings, however, he was required to do penance for the bloodshed. Whatever may be thought about "blessing banners" (or battleships or bombers) and "penance", something was properly understood all those years ago, back in the 11th century.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>What is the way forward? For Christians, we must evangelise and pray. War and the establishing of justice is a holding measure. Forgiveness of sin and new birth are the only ultimate solutions. So in the light of this present dangerous situation Paul's words to Timothy are as important as ever (1 Tim 2.1-2):<br><br>I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone - for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Euthanasia">(June 1999) Euthanasia</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 1999</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Dr David Moor</b><br><br>On the 11 May 1999, Dr David Moor, a local Newcastle doctor, was acquitted at Newcastle Crown Court, after facing charges of murdering a terminally ill patient by a lethal drug overdose. The case had national significance. In court he argued, contrary to what he had said earlier to the press and TV, that all he tried to do "in treating Mr Liddell [the patient] was to relieve his agony." So the jury did not convict him of murder - which would require an intention to kill. According to The Guardian, the turning point in the case came when the judge, Mr Justice Hooper, excluded key toxicological evidence leaving the prosecution with no proof that the drug injection had caused the death. The Judge decided that Dr Moor should pay a third of the defence costs, saying Dr Moor had partly brought the prosecution on himself by "very silly remarks to the press" and lying to the NHS and police.<br><br>This case highlighted two things: one, the vigorous campaigning by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Dr Moor's supporters in the 30,000 strong petition came from 19 countries of the world); and, two, the confusion over euthanasia. This case has not changed the law one wit. The case maintained a critical distinction. Doctors may administer drugs to relieve the pain and distress of dying patients, even if such a dose might, as a side effect, hasten death. That is known as the "double effect". What is prohibited is for doctors to give patients lethal doses intending to kill them.<br><br><br><b>Christian and anti-Christian views</b><br><br>The bible is clear that God is our creator. Human life is not our "property" - it is held in trust or on loan. We may not just "dispense" with it. As Job said: "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away" (Job 1.21). Our lives are meant for the service of God. It is not for us to "take" life. We should think of our lives in the spirit of Jesus Parable of the talents (Mat 25.14-15). And you have the fundamental prohibition on killing, and the basis for it, set out in Genesis 9.6:</p>

<blockquote><div>Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.</div></blockquote>

<p>Our significance, and so the claim to protection, derives not from our "quality of life" or gifts and abilities, but on our status as being made in God's image. We have the worth that he put on us when he "so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3.16).<br><br>But the world is drifting from that understanding.<br><br>Dr Jim Howe was Tony Bland's consultant neurologist. Tony Bland had been injured during the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and it resulted in his being in a "persistent vegetative state". The Law Lords made a controversial ruling to allow the withdrawal of food and water on the basis that this was "medical treatment" and not a normal right - in this case. Tony Bland was then allowed to die. Jim Howe has now gone public for the first time in an interview. One question was, "Did he see Tony Bland as a person?"</p>

<blockquote><div>No, his personhood had gone when his chest was crushed; he was not a person in the sense that I understand it, in an ethical sense. A person is someone who has the capacity to value their life: that's the definition given by Professor Harris from Manchester, and I think it's the best one I have seen. A person is that creature, that sentient creature, which has the capacity to value its own life, so by that definition chimpanzees and gorillas are persons; we should not kill them, any more than we should kill other human beings who don't want to be killed.</div></blockquote>

<p>The next question was: "Does a young baby have value as a person?"</p>

<blockquote><div>A new-born baby probably doesn't ... One of the things that irritates me about people who believe in the sanctity of life is that they don't extend that sanctity of life to higher primates and dolphins and so on - or maybe they do - because I think they should. They think that we have a God-given sanctity of life. Well, I don't believe in God so I don't see any divine imprint.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is the problem. And there are hidden agendas. There is an assault on Christian values. In Australia, the Northern Territory - with a tiny population - voted for euthanasia in 1995. That vote has subsequently been overturned, but not before Dr Nitschke, one of the Bill's proponents had help eliminate four people, with his laptop "deliverance" machine that administered the poison. He admits, however, "I had little contact with terminally ill patients until I became involved in the political struggle to try and get the legislation through up here." It is all part of his support for "libertarian-type issues" as he calls them. And who is stopping and overturning his efforts? He says, "the Church ... I think we can win against the [medical] profession but we didn't win against the Church. The Church is the force making the politicians crumble."<br><br><br><b>The solution</b><br><br>There is no real conceptual problem about euthanasia - "thou shalt not kill nor strive officiously to keep alive" is an excellent rule of thumb for doctors. What is wrong is intentional killing. There is a clear distinction between, on the one hand, taking action with the specific intention of shortening life; and, on the other hand, withdrawing medical treatment that is of no further benefit or that is so burdensome to the patient that it far outweighs any benefits it might produce. Yes, sometimes there are difficult decisions. But, no, this is not "killing" or euthanasia. Given a Christian framework, policies and practices can be worked out for new types of problem when they occur. But lacking such a framework there will be (and is) chaos. In Holland where euthanasia is tolerated, this already is the case. The elderly now carry "passports for life" in their wallets to avoid euthanasia if they should happen to end up in hospital.<br><br>A main problem is inadequate palliative (pain reducing) care. The solution, therefore, is wider knowledge and the wider use of the available resources of good palliative care - or so argues George Chalmers, a consultant geriatrician. If palliative care is not well taught in medical schools or researched there will be pressures for euthanasia. A report to the Health Council on Palliative Care in Holland concluded that 54% of cancer patients who were in pain, suffered unnecessarily because doctors and nurses had insufficient understanding of the nature of the pain and the possibilities for its alleviation (the culture of euthanasia in Holland may also explain the lack of provision of hospices for children). Kathryn Mannix, consultant in Palliative Medicine at the Marie Curie centre in Newcastle claims:<br><br>I have seen about 6000 patients in the last 13 years but in all that time I can only remember three occasions, when a patient has begged me to take their life.<br><br>And we must beware of myths - especially the myth that drug relief invariably means a shortening of life. It does not. Sadly this myth means some patients refuse help. But drugs often extend the patient's life by relief of debilitating pain and other symptoms.<br><br>There are other problems that generate support for euthanasia. Demographic changes mean that people are living longer, but with the break down of marriage and the family there are fewer potential carers for older and disabled people. This means higher expectations from the State. All this inevitably leads to a resource question - "who will pay and provide?" But this question of "who should care?" which is a legitimate one, should never turn into "why care?" or "should we care?" Also there are now higher expectations of cures generally in medicine and the non-acceptability of illness. This means people are less able to cope with illness, and indeed the approach of death.<br><br>But the most important practical problem is that people are less and less aware of the claims of God. Less believe that life is his gift; they think it is a human right, to be disposed of as any one will.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>It is urgent we fight these pressures for euthanasia. If it ever became legal, it would be used as an easy option for doctors, for patients and for relatives; it would inhibit the development of palliative care; it would entail a slide from voluntary to involuntary euthanasia as is happening in Holland, where according to Dr Anthony Daniels, "many doctors admit that they have killed their patients because they thought their patients would be better off dead;" it would, therefore, breakdown trust between doctors and patients and especially elderly patients.<br><br>Some words written 200 years ago are still relevant:</p>

<blockquote><div>The physician should and may do nothing else but preserve life. Whether it is valuable or not, that is none of his business. If he once permits such considerations to influence his actions, the doctor will become the most dangerous person in the State (Christoph Hufeland).</div></blockquote>

                <p><b>Relativism or 'no other name'?</b><br><br>How should a Christian respond to people of other faiths? The Bible is clear that all men and women are equal. We are all made in the image and likeness of God. That is why we must respect all of whatever race, gender, social status, age, development or health. So Christians have supported movements for freedom and movements for racial equality.<br><br>But are all religions equal? It is fashionable to say so today. To deny it is felt to be prejudiced. All roads lead to God, it is said. The Bible clearly does not agree. Jesus was unambiguous, John 14.6:</p>

<blockquote><div>Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."</div></blockquote>

<p>And the apostles were unambiguous. Peter said, Acts 4.12:</p>

<blockquote><div>Salvation is found in no one else [than Jesus], for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.</div></blockquote>

<p>But relativism is part of the late 20th century's mental furniture. Alan Bloom in his book The Closing of the American Mind writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>There is one thing a professor can be absolutely certain of: almost every student entering the university believes, or says he believes, that truth is relative.</div></blockquote>

<p>And he goes on:<br><br>If I pose the routine questions designed to confute them and make them think, such as, 'If you have been a British administrator in India, would you have let the natives under your governance burn the widow at the funeral of a man who had died?' they either remain silent or reply that the British should never have been there in the first place.<br><br><br><b>Matters of fact</b><br><br>It is not surprising, therefore, to find multi-faithism in the Church. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, after a visit to India claimed, 'that other faiths than our own are genuine mansions of the spirit with many rooms to be discovered.' And 'other faiths reveal other aspects of God which may enrich and enlarge our Christian understanding.' For that reason, he said, Christians 'will have to abandon any narrowly conceived Christian apologetic, based on a sense of superiority and an exclusive claim to truth.' <br><br>He reported visiting the late Mother Theresa's Home for the Dying in Calcutta: 'I had not realised before,' he said, 'that her hospice is built on temple property - dedicated appropriately enough to the goddess Kali. Here was the love of Christ given and received by men and women of all faiths and of none alongside the goddess who symbolizes a mixture of destruction and fertility.'<br><br>Robert Runcie, we have to say, was very wrong in his understanding of 'other faiths'.<br><br>First there are issues of fact. For example, was Jesus crucified? Islam says he was not. Christianity (and the clear evidence of history) says he was. They cannot both be right. <br><br>Donald McGavran, a former missionary and an authority on 'Church Growth', writes: 'To Christians of the masses in India, the biblical account - that God created one man and one woman and all men are their descendants - is particularly dear. It contrasts sharply with the Hindu account that the great god Brahm created the Brahams from his head, the warrior caste from his shoulders, the merchant castes from his thighs, and the masses from his feet.' There are two fundamentally different conceptions of human nature in those two accounts. They cannot both be right.<br><br>But what does the Bible teach directly about other faiths? There are five things to be said.<br><br><br><b>The Bible</b><br><br>First, what we read of the world's religions in the Bible is so often negative. When Paul was having an afternoon off in Athens and saw the evidence of other religions in the city, he did not think about the possibilities of inter-faith worship. No! 'His spirit was provoked within him' (Acts 17:16) and he ended up trying to convert the Athenians!<br><br>Secondly, of course, God can choose whom he likes to receive his grace. Melchizedek and Jethro in the Old Testament come to mind as two unlikely characters outside the ancient covenant community. But there is no suggestion that their 'religions' could in any way be alternative to the covenant revealed to Abraham and through him to Moses. <br><br>In the New Testament the Wise Men received divine guidance, but there is no suggestion that they were saved by their own religion. In fact God brought them to worship the child Jesus. <br><br>Later on in the New Testament we read that the prayers of the Gentile Cornelius were heard by God. So Peter concluded that 'in every nation any one who fears [God] and does what is right is acceptable to him' (Acts 10:34). But Cornelius himself said, under divine prompting, that 'salvation' required more than those prayers: it required the preaching and message of Peter (Acts 11:13). <br><br>Clearly preparation for faith occurs outside the community of the people of God. There was also the Ethiopian eunuch (and there are many similar people in the modern world). But the fact is that in whatever way God meets with people in other religious (or secular) settings, the Bible gives us no grounds for saying there is full salvation apart from acknowledging Christ. Religions (or secular philosophies) may play a part in helping to identify needs. But there is no salvation except in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12).<br><br>Thirdly, we must note that confusion comes through failing to distinguish the Holy Spirit's dual work - in Creation and universal history on the one hand, and in Redemption and salvation history on the other. Ever since the Reformation there has been a tendency in the West to make Redemption everything and to ignore Creation. The result is that God's work then gets assumed to be always and only Redemptive, even when what he is doing is Creative. Of course, he is engaged in redemptive work for, in and with the person of Christ and through the preaching of the Gospel; that is his great work. But we must never ignore his creative activity.<br><br>With that background the traditional categories of 'general' and 'special' revelation and 'common' and 'saving' grace are helpful here. General revelation is what God reveals of himself by Creation, in nature and through conscience. Special revelation is God's revelation in Christ and through prophets and apostles (so through the Bible). Common grace includes all the blessings of this life - the sun shines on the righteous and the unrighteous, after all. Saving grace is salvation and Redemption through Christ alone. <br><br>Much of the inter-faith confusion, surely, comes because general revelation (understood in other religions) is seen to be special and common grace (experienced in other religions) is seen to be saving. <br><br>Fourthly, confusion also can come, and a position of uncritical openness adopted, because of the way religion is often identified with culture. We may, indeed, want to affirm elements of another culture that is shaped by a non-Christian religion while at the same time being critical of some (or much) cultural baggage in Western Christianity. That is not the same, however, as affirming the truth of that other system of belief and worship. The bottom line has to be for the Christian that nobody comes to the Father but through Christ (John 14:6). <br><br>Fifthly, what we must say is not that God's common grace is never experienced in other religious (or secular) contexts; nor that general revelation is never heeded in other religious (or secular) contexts. But we must assume, nevertheless, the words of Jesus that his Father seeks 'true worshippers' (John 4:23). So worship should not only be in spirit but also in truth. For the Christian believer that will rule out misleading 'inter-faith' worship experiences such as sometimes are forced on children. It should rule out, also, the sort of remarks made by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>In the current climate of relativism it is suggested that there should only be 'dialogue' with people of other faiths. Some say that in the UK evangelism among our neighbours if they are of other faiths is improper. But, to quote Lesslie Newbigin: 'It is surely a very peculiar form of racism which would affirm that the good news entrusted to us is strictly for white Anglo-Saxons!'<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Luther">(September 1999) Luther</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 1999</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Background</b><br><br>Martin Luther was a colossus. He influenced Archbishop Cranmer, the Anglican Reformer, along with the great Continental Reformers. In essence the new movement that humanly Luther started was a 'back to the Bible' movement.<br><br>Not everyone agreed with Luther. He made some mistakes. And he was different. The French/Swiss Calvin was a scholar and intellectual giant. Cranmer was a typically British cautious Reformer and in Shakespeare's league as a writer. But Luther was rougher all round. He was very intelligent and enormously hard working. He shot-from-the-hip and was not always precise. Yet he brilliantly hit the traget. He spoke his mind. Nor was tact a high priority. He may have exaggerated at times but at least he said something while others kept their mouths shut out of fear of the Pope or the secular authorities. His goal was clear. It was to 'preach Christ'. As he says: 'the one doctrine which I have supremely at heart is that of faith in Christ.'<br><br>Born on 10 November 1483, Luther had a good education ending up at the University of Erfurt. He then entered an Augustinian monastery in the town at the age of twenty-two. He wanted to make his peace with God, having had an earlier brush with death and realizing that he was in no way fit to face his maker. But the monastery did not help him. As he said: 'If ever a monk could have got to heaven by monkery, it would have been me.' He never was sure he had sufficiently confessed his sins or done all that was required. Conscious of the wrath of a holy, righteous God confronting his sin, he knew he deserved God's condemnation. And he was right. This is what he read in his Bible. He knew there were no 'ladders to heaven' - neither those of the intellect, nor of works nor of mysticism. They did not reach God. Oh! he knew about grace. The Old Testament and Roman Catholicism taught about the primacy of God's grace - that unless God first worked there was no hope. But it was 'grace' plus; you needed human works as well - so he was taught - after God's grace if you were to be saved.<br><br>In 1508 he was made Professor at the new University of Wittenberg. With a short break back at Erfurt, he remained a Professor there until his death in 1546. He got this post thanks to the efforts of his vicar-general, Staupitz - a spiritual man of great learning and with a good knowledge of the Bible. Staupitz believed that if you were called by God and received his grace through the sacraments then you would get the strength to will and do what was good. No one could be certain of their election, but the sacraments gave you hope. Staupitz wanted Luther to turn from his despair and to seek God and not on the basis of his own resolutions or good works. Rather he was to trust God's forgiving mercy. He wanted Luther to think of Christ not as a condemning judge but as a Saviour. While not clear or the full gospel, this helped Luther go in the right direction.<br><br><br><b>Release</b><br><br>It was, however, Luther's study of the Psalms and Romans that helped him understand the good news - the gospel. He saw in Romans that Paul was saying that a person is set right with God utterly freely (there is no need of prior works) by grace (God is doing it all out of his love) in Christ. We are justified by faith (simply trusting and accepting what God has done). Luther came to see the core as what God had done in Christ at Calvary. His great work, his Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, could not be clearer. Writing on Galatians 3:13 where Paul says, 'Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us (for it is written: "Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree") etc (Deut. 21:23),' he says this: '[Christ] being made a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, is not now an innocent person and without sins ... but a sinner, which hath and carrieth the sin of Paul, who was a blasphemer, an oppressor and a persecutor; of Peter, which denied Christ; of David, which was an adulterer, a murderer, and caused the Gentiles to blaspheme the name of the Lord: and briefly, which hath and beareth all the sins of all men in his body, that he might make satisfaction for them with his own blood.'<br><br>Luther complained that Roman Catholic teachers 'do spoil us of this knowledge of Christ and most heavenly comfort (namely, that Christ was made a curse for us, that he might deliver us from the curse of the law), when they separate him from sins and sinners, and only set him out unto us as an example to be followed.'<br><br>Of course, Luther knew Christ was sinless: 'He verily is innocent, because he is the unspotted and undefiled Lamb of God. But because he beareth the sins of the world, his innocence is burdened with the sins and guilt of the whole world.' And this is the gospel. He says it is, 'a singular consolation for all the godly, so to clothe Christ with our sins, and to wrap him in my sins, thy sins, and the sins of the whole world, and so to behold him bearing all our iniquities.' It is here, he argues, that 'the doctrine of the Gospel' shines out:</p>

<blockquote><div>[It] speaketh nothing of our works or of the works of the law, but of the unspeakable and inestimable mercy and love of God towards us unworthy and lost men: to wit, that our most merciful Father, seeing us to be oppressed and overwhelmed with the curse of the law, and so to be beholden under the same that we could never be delivered from it by our own power, sent his only Son into the world and laid upon him all the sins of all men, saying: "Be thou Peter that denier; Paul that persecutor, blasphemer and cruel oppressor; David that adulterer; that sinner which did eat the apple in Paradise; that thief which hanged upon the cross; and briefly, be thou the person which have committed the sins of all men; see therefore that thou pay and satisfy for them." Here now cometh the law and saith: "I find him a sinner, and that such a one as hath taken upon him the sins of all men, and see no sins else but in him; therefore let him die upon the cross." And so he setteth upon him and killeth him. By this means the whole world is purged and cleansed from all sins, and so delivered from death and all evils. Now sin and death being abolished by this one man, God would see nothing else in the whole world, especially if it did believe, but a mere cleansing and righteousness.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Faith and Prayer</b><br><br>'Especially if it did believe' - faith is then the key. But what is faith? According to Luther:</p>

<blockquote><div>There are two ways of believing. First, to believe that there is a God. This kind of faith is knowledge, or information, rather than faith as such. Secondly, there is faith in God. This faith I possess when I not only hold that what is said about God is true, but when I put my whole trust in him, undertake to deal with him personally, and believe without doubt that I shall find him to be and to do as I have been told.</div></blockquote>

<p>And essential to faith is God's word. 'Is it not true to say that God's word is greater and more important than faith? For God's word is not founded and built on faith, but on the contrary, faith is built on God's word. Besides, our faith may waver, even fail altogether, but the word of God stands for ever.'<br><br>And faith will be followed by 'good works' - not as a cause of salvation but a consequence. 'There is something vital, energetic, active, mighty about this kind of faith,' says Luther. 'It is impossible for it not to be engaged in good works without ceasing.' And there will be prayer. 'We should pray, not as the custom is, turning over many pages or counting many beads, but fixing our mind upon some pressing need; desire it with all earnestness, and exercise faith and confidence towards God in the matter, in such a way that we do not doubt but that we shall be heard.' 'Prayer is a two-way activity. First, we speak to God, and then he speaks to us. Simply talk with God - that is the nature of prayer. How great and glorious a thing it is that the most high God in all his majesty so condescends to us poor worms of earth that we may open our mouths to talk to him, and that he delights to listen. Yet more glorious and precious by far it is that he does actually speak to us, and that we listen to him.' And how do we hear God speak? 'Let the man who wants to hear God speak read Holy Scripture.' 'Whenever a man reads the word of God, he is being handled by God: the Holy Spirit is speaking to him.' Luther was not interested in a 'silent God'. 'I have always with the greatest diligence exhorted men to read Scripture and to hear the spoken word, that we may deal with the God who has revealed himself and is speaking to us, and may in every way avoid the God who is silent and hidden in majesty.'<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>This is the context from which Luther took on the Church and the world. In 1517 he posted his ninety-five theses on the door at Wittenberg that included an attack on the false assurance of indulgences (money you could pay the Church to release you from purgatory). In 1520 he was excommunicated by the Pope. Before the Emperor at the Diet of Worms in 1521 he famously said: 'I cannot and will not recant! I can no other! Here I stand! May God help me! Amen!' He had to fight his own extremists in 1522; the clever but weak Erasmus in 1524; the peasants revolt in 1525 which harmed the cause as they jumped on the Reformation band-wagon. And so it went on until his death in 1546. All the time he was writing and teaching and leading the Church in reform. Praise God for Luther.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Sudan, Human Rights and an Unholy Silence">(October 1999) The Sudan, Human Rights and an Unholy Silence</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 1999</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Bombing Raids</b><br><br>Earlier this year a joint US/British mission team sponsored by Sharing of Ministries Abroad and CMS (the Church Mission Society) visited churches in the Southern Sudan. The Anglican Church in the Sudan had asked them to hold seminars for pastors and church leaders - the first such conference in that region for the Church for more than 10 years. <br><br>What happened? One thing the team experienced was something the Sudanese live with daily - bombing raids. Alison Barfoot reported the visit as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>On February 27, a government "Antonov" bomber attacked the hospital and market area in the town of Mardi, where the church was holding [the] conference, dropping six anti-personnel bombs. Four days later, the bomber returned and dropped no fewer than 16 bombs.The bombs were not aimed at military targets. Rather, they were aimed at the Episcopal cathedral, the Roman Catholic church, the hospital and the market - all places where civilians gather.A 5 year old girl named Mario died that day from a piece of shrapnel that struck her head. My friends [people on the team] visited and prayed with her grieving parents trying to bring them hope in the midst of their chaos' (The Kansas City Star, 15 April 1999).</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Ethnic Cleansing</b><br><br>I was a missionary with CMS in the Sudan in 1964-1965, at the beginning of this genocide - for such it is. The Muslim Sudanese government in the North is engaging in its own form of ethnic cleansing against the Sudanese in the South who are non-Arab ethnic Africans, mostly Christian. <br><br>The consequence is that more people from the predominantly Christian South have already been murdered than all the victims in Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda combined. In ten years almost two million people have died and five million have been displaced, reckons Alison Barfoot. Another 2.5 million are currently at risk of starvation, kept alive only by the heroic efforts of international aid groups. 'Virtually every provision of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been violated. And yet the world stays silent.'<br><br>Nor is it just Anglicans. Roman Catholics are also being attacked. William Saunders is an American Human Rights lawyer. He met in Washington a Sudanese bishop who had come to protest about the murder and enslavement of his people (yes, Northerners sell Southerners as slaves). As a result last Christmas Saunders went out to the Sudan to be with the bishop for a pastoral visitation in the Nuba Mountains and northern Bahr el-Ghazal.<br><br>The Nuba Mountains are 'north of the south' - near the centre of the country. The government of the Sudan is trying to depopulate this area of black Nuba people and to replace them with Muslim tribes. As the US Committee for Refugees reported in December 1998, the government's aim is to force the people off their land and into 'peace camps' where they are forced to convert to Islam or starve (the government refuses to allow UN-sponsored famine relief operations to come to the Nuba Mountains). <br><br>But also in the Nuba Mountains are Muslims who are peaceful and tolerant of both the Christians and the animists in the region. From the government's perspective, therefore, they are not 'good' Muslims and so they too need to be destroyed. <br><br><br><b>Christmas 1998 in the Nuba Mountains</b><br><br>Writing in the journal First Things (May 1999) William Saunders tells of his experiences last Christmas. He tells how he and the bishop had to fly in secretly to avoid being spotted by Government aeroplanes.They were met by a friendly resistance soldier named Mohammed Ali, and then went from village to village where they were greeted with 'singing, dancing and drumming'. Saunders writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>As I witnessed their joy at the presence of their "outlawed" bishop, the words of the gospel came to mind: "Blessed are you when men hate you, and revile you, and denounce your name as criminal, on account of the Son of Man! Rejoice in that day, and dance for joy" (Luke 6.22-23).</div></blockquote>

<p>And there were water problems. On the way to visit a new school, although the rainy season had barely ended, they found a river bed where the river was already bone dry. He writes:<br><br>'Finding water is difficult in the Mountains. Though the Nuba Mountain area is the ancestral home of the Nuba people, government troops and allied Muslim tribes have forced them higher into the mountains, away from their traditional pastures and wells. (The government poisons their wells whenever they are found.) Without tools, they are forced to dig wells by hand, though sometimes they are able to use pieces of shrapnel for digging. In this river bed, the people had dug such a well. It was about five feet deep. Since both people and animals use it, it is often contaminated, and the people suffer many ailments as a result.'<br><br>When he reached the school he found it lacking 'chairs or desks; tree branches are used instead. The teachers are also in desperate need of books, paper, and pencils.'<br><br>On Christmas Day the people gathered in the Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul. But ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... this is a cathedral like few others. It is not a building; rather, it is composed of "pillars" of living sycamore trees that offer camouflage from government planes. Beneath the trees, in a hollow, we gather with perhaps a thousand parishioners ... During the service, the bishop received a message from the resistance. They had intercepted a message from the military - the planes had been sent to bomb ... the bishop ... asked us to pray ... Luckily the planes did not find us.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Bahr el-Ghazal</b><br><br>A few days later Saunders and the bishop left the Nuba Mountains for Bahr el-Ghazal. On that very day, the government bombed a Nuba village with its church and school. 'Now we must start all over again,' said the bishop. And when the government troops overran another nearby village, they abducted the mother and children of Muhammed Ali, the friendly Muslim soldier they met on arrival.<br><br>In Bahr el-Ghazal there had been no clergy in the area they were visiting for twenty years. But there were catechists. The catechists, however, are now in great need of Bibles and other books. One said, 'it has been so long, we have nearly forgotten the words.' But the catechists had been as faithful as possible. Several had been murdered, most had been hunted, some had been tortured but escaped. One of the latter told Saunders that his captors had demanded, 'Convert [to Islam], or die like Jesus Christ.' Then on 28 December 1998 Saunders and the bishop met with 'the redeemed children'.<br><br>'These were Dinka children [the Dinka are a Southern, very tall, tribe], from age nine to nineteen, who had been abducted and enslaved by Muslim militias or Muslim tribesmen, and who had either escaped or been "redeemed" from their captors for a price. Some had been abducted at ages as young as six: some had spent twelve years in slavery. Usually their parents had been killed before their eyes. All were now orphans; some had been so young when they were kidnapped that they could never find their way home; many did not know their given names. Some of the girls had been raped. All of the children had been grievously mistreated. In a scene whose horror is difficult to convey, the children showed us where each had been branded, as one would brand an animal, on the forehead or arm.'<br><br>There were seventy of these children. The church takes care of them, making sure they are clothed, fed, housed, and educated. Despite their suffering, they were radiating hope. One of the elders told Saunders, 'If we surrender to the government, we will be slaves in our own land. We have heard about human rights on the radio. Why, if there are human rights, does the world not help us?'<br><br><br><b>'Their Blood Cries Out'</b><br><br>In the remarkable book by Paul Marshall with Lela Gilbert, Their Blood Cries Out: The Growing Worldwide Persecution of Christians, that question is addressed. <br><br>The book makes it abundantly evident, as one reviewer A.J.Bacevich put it, that 'in an age notorious for the widespread abuse of human rights, the murder, torture, imprisonment, and victimization of Christians because they are Christians constitutes "the largest pattern of persecution in the world." Furthermore, due to apathy among believers and bias among the enlightened, this epidemic of persecution "is allowed to pass in a deafening silence".'<br><br>The book surveys the Muslim world and is careful to point out that not all Islam is violent towards Christianity, but it makes it clear that many Muslims are repressing Christians on a vast scale. Naturally it surveys the Sudan, where in the past decade 'Islamization through genocide' has caused the death of between 1.5 and 3 million Christians (so Marshall estimates); Iran, where Christians endure conditions of 'religious apartheid'; Saudi Arabia where 'Christian worship is banned' and where it is 'illegal to wear a cross or to utter a Christian prayer'; Egypt, where 'militant Islamic groups are targeting Christians for murder, assault, theft, and destruction of property'; Algeria, where violent attacks on Catholic clergy have become routine; and Pakistan, where blasphemy laws provide the rationale for 'a reign of private terror against Christians.' The book also mentions East Timor.<br><br>But it is not just Muslims that persecute the church. The former Communist world still has much hostility towards Christians - in Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and especially China, where today 'there are more Christians attending regular church worship services ... than there are in all of Western Europe combined.' It is the same elsewhere in Asia where other religions are dominant - in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Bhutan, Burma and Cambodia. 'Even in less likely quarters - in Russia, central Europe, and Latin America, where the population identifies itself as Christian - nonconformists or adherents of minority denominations find themselves subject to all manner of discrimination and abuse.' <br><br><br><b>Why is there such persecution of Christians?</b> <br><br>Marshall makes the following comment:</p>

<blockquote><div>The assault on Christians is a fundamental part of the assault on human freedom itself. Many Christians are leading democracy and human-rights activists. They are also in the forefront of economic development. But perhaps more important than what they do is what they are. While usually loyal citizens, they embody an attachment to 'another King', a loyalty to a standard of spiritual allegiance apart from the political order. This fact itself denies that the state is the all-encompassing or ultimate arbiter of human life. Regardless of how the relation between God and Caesar has been expressed, it now at least means that, contra the Romans and modern totalitarians, Caesar is not God. This confession, however mute, sticks in the craw of every authoritarian regime and draws their angry and bloody response.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Why does the world not help?</b><br><br>But why is there such deafening silence? In the mid-1980s there was international help for Ethiopia, then Bosnia, then Somalia, then Rwanda, then Kosovo. But why is the plight of Christians so ignored? Why is a country like the Sudan ignored - the largest country in Africa, the size of Europe? Why has East Timor been helped so late in the day?<br><br>One reason is that Christians are often ignored quite perniciously by the Western secular media and secular agencies. The Southern Sudan being particularly Christian is especially likely to be ignored. In 1994 the periodical Christianity Today reported that over 75 percent of all south Sudanese consider themselves 'born again'. And as Paul Liben says: 'Evidence abounds that within all Christian groups, ranging from Catholics and Anglicans to nondenominational movements, genocide has brought not abandonment of faith, but renewal. In the South Sudan, Christian martyrdom has, as well, drawn Christians of all traditions closer together.' But there is almost a news blackout as far as the main media is concerned.<br><br>Among secular media elites there seems to be a trend of opposition to the Christian faith. This is perverse but a real problem. This trend could be seen during the bombing in Kosovo and Serbia earlier this year. The Western media often seemed to demonize all 'Serbs' - Christians together with Serb Marxists and the men of violence. And that was in spite of the fact that Patriarch Pavle, leader of Serbia's Orthodox Christians, had been a voice of opposition to Slobodan Milosevic and took part in pro-democracy demonstrations in the early 1990s.<br><br>The trend is also seen in the BBC reports on East Timor which almost never mention in news bulletins that the murder of East Timoreans has been the murder of Christians. Of course, the situation is not just a religious war. But the religious dimension is not irrelevant. As Marshall writes: 'the struggle is largely political in the sense of focusing on land and independence, rather than being overtly religious. Nevertheless, the result is that a largely Christian territory (about 80 percent of the population is Catholic) [has been] in major opposition to a largely Muslim government.' But religion has been a 'spark' in the violence as Marshall documents.<br><br>Then take the Sudan itself. Marshall reports on a North American camera crew in the Sudan not so long ago who were 'asked if the massacre of Christians would itself make their network come to the Sudan. They replied, "No! only the issue of slavery would draw TV companies' interest."' <br><br>Nor are some of the secular human rights organizations much better than the news media. Amnesty International, for example, has produced some excellent reports on the Sudan. But they give little attention to the religious dimension. 'Its Sudan: The Tears of Orphans says, "Bigots on all sides, Muslims and Christians alike, have exploited religion, making it a significant factor in the continued fighting." This statement is literally true, but it gives a distorted picture of a conflict involving Christian resistance to a fervently Islamicizing government.' Marshall points out that it is 'a conflict which has, by one side, been pronounced a jihad, which involves widespread forced conversion to Islam, sometimes on penalty of death.' So 'religion is no mere veneer.'<br><br><br><b>Why does the church not help?</b><br><br>If 'the world' does not help because the media and secular organizations have refused to give proper publicity to Christian persecution, why cannot the church help?<br><br>In 1995, Michael Horowitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote an editorial for the Wall Street Journal. He said that the 'evidence of growing and large-scale persecution of evangelicals and Christian converts is overwhelming.' He challenged American Jews like himself not to be silent in the face of 'persecutions eerily parallel to those committed by Adolf Hitler.' Horowitz then wrote to 150 denominational mission boards: 'I am writing because I am pained and puzzled at the relative lack of interest shown by many within the Christian community of fellow Christians who are now increasingly persecuted - as Christians and for their beliefs alone - throughout the world.'<br><br><br><b>What is the trouble?</b><br><br>Why do not evangelicals make this a priority for their prayers and political lobbying? One reason is the lack of information. They are too often dependent on the secular media. <br><br>Another reason is, as one Mission leader has said, '[Western] Christians have no experience of persecution or suffering for their faith which remotely resembles the experiences of many of our overseas brothers and sisters. It is difficult to empathize ... many, many, many Christians refuse to believe what is reported because it is so far outside their experience.' <br><br>Yet another reason is that too many Christians have been caught up in the 'therapeutic culture'. This is all part of the 'me' generation. So the Christian faith is seen to be about 'inner peace and joy' and being 'comfortable with yourself'. There is a preoccupation with emotional well-being and with a gospel that 'Christ died for your problems' rather than 'your sins'. 'The subject of persecuted Christians,' writes Marshall, 'is jarring to an obsession with personal peace.' It is not that an inward focus is wrong; it is wrong if this is the only focus while the desperate need of persecuted Christians is ignored. <br><br>Then many liberal churches since the 1960s have virtually given up on the Christian faith. With a relativism that makes all religions equal, openness to, and dialogue with, other religions is a primary value. 'One of the results' says Marshall, 'has been a reluctance to raise anything which might damage peaceful relations with conversation partners. This also leads to an animus against people engaged in seeking to propagate their faith, with an implication that such troublemakers might deserve what they get. This means that [such liberals] don't seem to like evangelism and are not very sympathetic to those who suffer for it.' This is shocking. It is not surprising if such people are more likely to be supportive of gay or animal rights than of the genuine human rights of those whose lives are in danger for their faith in Christ.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>What must we do? We must pray, keep informed, lobby when and where we can and always keep in mind Hebrews 13.3:</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>I am vicar of Jesmond, in Newcastle upon Tyne in England. We have nearly 1000 different people in church every Sunday - that is not large for some areas of the world, but for the Church of England it is: many are young, many are professional, many are students and many come from overseas.<br><br>But Jesmond Parish Church has rejected the spiritual oversight of the diocesan bishop, Martin Wharton, because he openly endorsed the principle that "faithful, lifelong, committed and permanent [homosexual] relationships are permitted - certainly amongst the lay members of the church, but that cannot be the position for the priests." Other parishes are taking a similar position.<br><br>This is a problem not only for Newcastle in the Province of York. It is also a problem for the Worcester diocese in the Province of Canterbury. The current Bishop of Worcester, Peter Selby, has written that "most of the biblical statements about homosexuality seem to me to be unacceptable". It was this man, the Bishop of Worcester, who said that the Lambeth Conference was like a "Nuremberg Rally!" One parish there already seems to be rejecting the oversight of the bishop and needing help immediately.<br><br>The situation is clearly not as bad in the Church of England as it is in ECUSA. However it is growing and serious in England. The Bishop of Norwich said in the House of Lords on 13 April 1999 in the debate concerning lowering the age of consent for homosexuals that there was a division within the House of Bishops. About one third would support lowering the age of consent, he said. That means that in time there will be more parishes rejecting the spiritual oversight of their bishop. Already there are problems with the Bishop of Bath and Wells, a bishop in the Province of Canterbury. The bishop, Jim Thompson, is chairman of the Church of England's Children's Society. Under his chairmanship the society has recently changed its policy on adoption and fostering to permit gay and lesbian couples to adopt and foster.<br><br>But in England parishes that reject the spiritual oversight of their bishop on the grounds of their teaching and stance on the homosexual issue, have no provision of other oversight. The "flying bishops" are a provision only for the issue of the ordination of women. Furthermore, a "flying bishop" provides only extended oversight and this can operate only with the permission of the bishop whose oversight is being rejected as heretical.<br><br>Let me say, too, while I am still talking about myself that culturally and by temperament I am thoroughly English: I am cautious, conservative and careful. I am somewhat academic, having taught at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, before moving to Jesmond 27 years ago. I am, therefore, not someone who by instinct wants precipitate action.<br><br>Also I have had a wide knowledge of the structural life of the Church of England. For 15 years I was on the General Synod of the Church of England - and its boards and councils, including its Standing Committee and Policy Sub-Committee under Robert Runcie. I worked with Runcie at close quarters for five years and I, sadly, came to the conclusion that the gospel was seriously eroded during Robert Runcie's archiepiscopate. The two key symptoms of that erosion were the homosexualization of the church and the multi-faith agenda, with its teaching that Jesus Christ is not the only way.<br><br>And I learnt this significant lesson: that change, reformation and leadership is less likely to come from the Western Anglican churches - such as those in the UK or USA. It more likely to come from Africa and South East Asia with help from South America.<br><br>I learnt, too, that English Evangelicals, as they get involved in the structures, often are subtly seduced by them - they then lose their cutting edge; they even lose their biblical faith.<br><br>One evangelical friend of mine became the secretary for the Board for Social Responsibility of the General Synod; he later became a bishop. But he was the one who preached the sermon at the notorious gay and lesbian anniversary service in Southwark Cathedral - a service that was an "abomination".<br><br>Other evangelicals as they get involved in the structures are either intimidated or frustrated by them so that they find it very hard to take action. I believe that may be true of another evangelical friend (from his time at Durham, when he regularly preached at Jesmond Parish Church, took Jesmond Parish house parties and was a member of the local evangelical fellowship) - George Carey.<br><br>But action now needs to be taken. Action is required. It is required because of the enormity of the problem.<br><br>There are times of real crisis in the church - with issues literally of life and death. That was true of the Arian crisis in the early centuries of the church. That was true at the time of the Reformation in the 16th century. That was true at the time of the Deist controversy in the 18th century - a controversy that the great evangelical revival resolved. And that is true today, with the paganizing of the church.<br><br>So how, as Anglicans, should we address this situation?<br><br>Anglicans like to use arguments from the Bible, Tradition and Reason, although Hooker, to whom that trilogy goes back, always said that the Bible is the supreme authority and must judge church Tradition and Reason. So, with that caution, let us take the Bible, Tradition and Reason and in that order.<br><br><br><b>First, THE BIBLE</b><br><br>Steve Noll, soon to be the vice-chancellor of the new Christian University here in Uganda, drew my attention to the relevance of the letter of the risen Jesus to the church at Thyatira in Revelation 2.18-27.<br><br>There were four groups or elements in the Church of Thyatira. <br><br>There was Jezebel who "by her teaching ... misleads my servants into sexual immorality" and idolatry (verse 20). <br><br>Then there were those who were her disciples and "commit adultery with her" (verse 22). <br><br>But there were also some very good Christian people who were growing in "love and faith, and service and perseverance." And yet these were the real problem people in the church. They are the ones Jesus is primarily concerned with in this letter. And he says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>I have this against you - you tolerate that woman.</div></blockquote>

<p>It was not that they were infected by her teaching (as yet). They were not like those "who commit adultery with her." They simply just did nothing. <br><br>Finally there was a fourth group of people who presumably had a more radical rejection of Jezebel. They were told to "hold on".<br><br>However we exegete that passage, "sexual immorality" and "idolatry" are lines in the sand! And, of course, homosexual activity is a sub-species of sexual immorality; and the multi-faith agenda is a sub-species of idolatry. These, therefore, are primary issues, not secondary issues. They call for swift discipline (or its equivalent) not dialogue and discussion. <br><br>Anglicanism has never been comprehensive over primary issues, only secondary issues. Error and heresy over primary issues requires not gentle and lengthy negotiations but immediate action. In the Church of England we are legally bound - I am legally bound - "to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's word" (1662 Ordinal). And under the Church of England's Canon C18 every bishop is also bound to do that.<br><br>But what, you ask, about unity? In my own scriptural reading yesterday, I read Hebrews 12. Verse 14 struck me in the light of our discussions: "make every effort to live in peace with all men." I believe that is so important and by "style" Anglicans seek, rightly, to do that. But the verse immediately goes on, "[make every effort to live in peace with all men] and to be holy." The writer then goes on to talk about a "bitter root" that can "defile many". And verse 16 applies this to "sexual immorality". It is quite clear that "making every effort to live in peace" is compatible with firm and decisive action to root out "bitter roots". There has to be disunity with respect to people like Jezebel (who probably was a very nice woman, in outward appearance).<br><br>Perhaps one of the most important passages on unity is John 17 verses 20-21. Jesus has been praying for his disciples - his apostles - and then he says:</p>

<blockquote><div>my prayer is not for them alone [his 1st century apostles]. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their [the apostles'] message [i.e. the church, or believers, of all succeeding generations] that all of them may be one ... </div></blockquote>

<p>He is praying for the unity of the church of succeeding generations, not among itself - among its current members - but for the unity of the church of succeeding generations with the apostles or their message - the apostolic teaching. As there is that unity with the apostles, so there will become a unity within the church of succeeding generations. Conversely as there is disunity between any church of succeeding generations and the apostolic church, so there will be disunity within that church.<br><br>Finally on the Bible, what does it say about action? Somethings in God's purposes have to wait beyond the life time of individuals on many occasions. That is obvious. But calls for obedience have to be acted on immediately: that is also an obvious teaching throughout the Bible and hardly calls for comment.<br><br><br><b>Secondly, TRADITION</b><br><br>How does our Anglican tradition help us at such a time as this? Very simply, it suggests that leadership at times of crisis comes not from waiting for a consensus, but (at times of crisis, not in more normal times) leadership comes from visionary men taking action.<br><br>Take the establishment of the Anglican Communion which, in effect, began 200 years ago with the founding of the CMS (the Church Missionary Society) in 1799 and with whom I worked for a period in the sixties in the Sudan.<br><br>The founders of CMS included such people as Charles Simeon of Holy Trinity, Cambridge. They were opposed by the then authorities - bishops in the church. Some bishops refused to ordain men to go overseas. As evangelicals they were objected to on doctrinal grounds: they were called "Calvinists". But the imperatives of the gospel meant that "the system" had to be defeated - men had to be ordained. The first ordinations were in 1813.<br><br>Fortunately there were some bishops who broke ranks and were willing to act irregularly. Bishop Ryder (Bishop of Gloucester, then of Lichfield and Coventry) and Bishop Bathurst (Bishop of Norwich) were prepared to ordain "men at the [CMS] committee's request, accepting as a title the committee's agreement to employ them" (Stock, History of CMS, vol. 1, p 245). Even the Archbishop of York ordained men in this way on two or three occasions. But then in 1819 came the Colonial Service Act. This Act of Parliament regularized any irregularities and the Bishop of London then had the responsibility for ordaining men, or seeing that they were ordained, for the colonies.<br><br>The point is this: our Anglican communion, which we represent from all over the world, had its beginnings, formally, with irregularities. The founders of CMS didn't wait for the religious establishment to provide for ordination. They sought out bishops who would be willing to put the needs of the gospel before the niceties of secondary issues - keeping to the letter of the regulations.<br><br>This also was the position taken by Luther at the time of the Reformation. He had to act irregularly. His argument was simple: "would it not be unnatural if a fire broke out in a city and everybody were to stand by and let it burn on and on and consume everything that could burn because nobody had the authority of the mayor, or because, perhaps, the fire broke out in the mayor's house? In such a situation is it not the duty of every citizen to arouse and summon the rest? How much more should this be done in the spiritual city of Christ if a fire of offence breaks out, whether in the papal government, or anywhere else."<br><br>In the early centuries of the church - at the time of the Arian crisis - Athanasius acted irregularly. According to the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates (AD 380-450) Athanasius ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... admonished the inhabitants of every city to beware of the Arians, and to receive those only that professed the Homoousian faith. In some of the churches also he performed ordination; which afforded another grounds of accusation against him, because of his undertaking to ordain in the dioceses of others.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Thirdly, REASON</b><br><br>Reason says that the Primates' Meeting in March will not be able to solve our problems unless there is some action before hand. Apart from key revisionist Primates being present, and the agenda and the management of the meeting being steered by a liberal secretariat, the Primates will not properly be able to assess the facts. It has taken us three days of solid presentations from the various interested parties and then serious discussion, not to mention the preceding written submissions and the "Come and See" programme of visits to the US, for this meeting to be able to grapple with the issues in a constructive way. Good decisions can only be taken on a proper understanding of the facts. The Primates at Lisbon will not have the opportunity of hearing from First Promise and the rest of us. Through no fault of their own, they are unlikely to have adequate information to be able to take any radical decision. At best they could decide for "further work" to be done!<br><br>Reason also says that our group of Primates here at Kampala are a minority and are unlikely, from "cold", to be able to persuade enough of the other Primates with the likes of Richard Holloway and Frank Griswold present who will oppose their position.<br><br>"Structurally" it will be easier for the Primates' meeting in Lisbon to react to alternative episcopal oversight already on the ground and so already on the agenda of the Anglican Communion, than for that meeting to initiate a solution to all the problems.<br><br>A number of the structures we have inherited (and which have only recently been formed) in the Anglican Communion are flawed. Our quarrel is not with Anglican beliefs, grounded as they are on the Bible as the supreme authority and the Fathers and Councils of the Church that are congruous with the Bible - such beliefs are found in the 39 Articles, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal. Rather we see the structures manipulated in ways that undermine those true Anglican beliefs. Reason says that these structures are not sacrosanct. So the March meeting of the Primates in Lisbon needs to react to initiatives taken before the meeting. To wait for the advice of the meeting is likely to mean waiting for a long time and so will further damage the cause of the gospel. And then for our Primates to act after the Lisbon meeting may well be said to be "disobedient" and "divisive". This will certainly be the case if the meeting says that no action should be taken without a consensus.<br><br>Reason, therefore, says that our Primates should follow two courses of action now.<br><br>First, they should act immediately to provide alternative oversight in the US and then, where necessary, elsewhere before March. This is by way of "emergency action". Missionary bishops, for example, could be appointed by "overseas" dioceses to act where needed. <br><br>Secondly, our Primates should produce, and present, to the Lisbon meeting of all the Primates, a serious document that will address the wider problems that lie behind the paganizing of ECUSA and to a lesser extend the Church of England and other Anglican churches around the world. The issues need to be confronted head on and up front. This is vital and urgent for the health (and survival, long term) of the Anglican Communion.<br><br>The Archbishop of Canterbury would find it difficult to initiate any solution himself, but if there is a division at the Primates meeting in Lisbon between the orthodox Christian Primates and the liberal, semi-pagan revisionists, he will side with the orthodox. But there needs to be a "practical demonstration" on the ground already to highlight the problem, let alone to meet desperate pastoral and evangelistic needs that cannot wait.<br><br>Nor would the provision of alternative episcopal oversight where there is currently heretical oversight be "innovative" and so requiring consultation. It is not like the ordination of women. It is simply Christian obedience. Even Cyprian could say "a people obedient to the precepts of the Lord is bound to separate itself from a sinful prelate." And Anglican Article 26 (of the 39), while it makes clear that "sometimes the evil have chief authority" in the church and their ministry still can be valid, "nevertheless" it also makes clear that such men are not to continue in office. According to the Article they are to be "deposed". When the structures fail to enable basic discipline, other solutions have to be tried.<br><br>Yes, they will involve irregularity. The structures that determine regularity have to be bye-passed. But, and with this I will close, the willingness to ignore protocol is in direct proportion to how serious you see the problem. If the future of the gospel is at stake, the higher "canons" must override the lower "canons". And the supreme canon, of course, is the "canon" of Scripture. A decision from Kampala not to act now will be interpreted as the evangelical Primates saying they are willing for Christ's church to be desecrated; and that the honour and name of the Lord Jesus Christ is less important than the "regularities" of a decadent church.<br><br>Remember the "good" Christians of Thyatira and their problem: it was a tolerance of sexual immorality and idolatry. And Jesus says: "He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Revelation 2.29).<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Cranmer on Faith">(December 1999) Cranmer on Faith</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 1999</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Thomas Cranmer was Archbishop of Canterbury in the 16th century under King Henry VIII. He was archbishop during the critical years of the Reformation in England and a literary genius to compare with Shakespeare: we, indeed, owe the Book of Common Prayer to Cranmer. But he was also a masterly theologian. It was Cranmer who was responsible for the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion of the Church of England and it was Cranmer who wrote three of the most famous 'homilies' (or sermons) from the Anglican Book of Homilies. These were, the sermon Of the Salvation of all Mankind, the 'short declaration' Of the True and Lively Faith, and the sermon Of Good Works. Over 400 years later they are all still readable and relevant. And how they need to be read!<br><br>As we approach the new Millennium the omens are not good. The Economist's 'World in 2000' predicts that</p>

<blockquote><div>Britain in the year 2000 will be richer, fitter and more sophisticated in its technology and tastes ... But it will also be a lonelier, more atomistic society, in which traditional pillars of support are atrophying away. And it will be divided.</div></blockquote>

<p>One of these divides will be over religious commitment: 'more than half of the population will go through the year without any participation in religious activity.' And 'modern Britons will have to fend for themselves with much less in the way of family, corporate or spiritual support.'<br><br>Cranmer has much to say to the modern world. So a reading of Cranmer on faith, is no bad way to prepare to celebrate 2000 years of Christianity. What follows (and minimally edited) is the first part of Cranmer's Short Declaration of the True, Lively and Christian Faith.<br><br><br><b>First, Dead Faith</b><br><br>"The first entry to God, good Christian people, is through faith, by which we are justified before God. So that no-one should be deceived for lack of right understanding of this, you must note diligently that faith is taken in the Scripture in two ways. There is one faith which in Scripture is called dead faith, which brings forth no good works, but is idle, barren and unfruitful. The holy apostle James compares this faith to the faith of devils, who believe God to be true and just, and tremble for fear, yet they do nothing well, but all evil. This is the faith of the wicked and ungodly Christian people, who confess God (as Paul says) with their mouth, but deny him in their deeds, and are abominable, and without the right faith, and in all good works reprehensible. This faith is a persuasion and belief in man's heart, which means that he knows that there is a God, and assents to all truth of God's most holy word, contained in holy Scripture, but it consists only in believing that the word of God is true. This is not properly called faith."<br><br>"Someone who reads the works of Caesar believing them to be true, has a knowledge of Caesar's life and noble acts because he believes the history of Caesar. Yet it is not that he believes in Caesar, from whom he expects no help nor benefit. It is the same with someone who believes that all that is spoken of God in the Bible is true, and yet lives in such an ungodly way that he cannot expect to enjoy the promises and benefits of God. It may be said that such a man has a faith and belief in the words of God. Yet it is not really true that he believes in God, or has a faith and trust in God by which he may expect grace, mercy, and eternal life at God's hand. Rather, he may expect indignation and punishment, according to the merits of his wicked life. For, as it is written in a book said to be by Didymus Alexandrinus: 'In as much as faith without works is dead, it is not truly faith, as a dead man is not a man'. This dead faith, therefore, is not that sure and substantial faith which saves sinners."<br><br><br><b>Secondly, Living Faith</b><br><br>"There is another faith in Scripture, which is not idle, unfruitful, and dead like the previous faith. It works by love as Paul declares (Galatians 5). As the other, false faith is called a dead faith, so may this be called a living faith. This is not only belief in the doctrines of our faith, but it is also a sure trust and confidence in the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. It is a steadfast hope of all good things to be received from God's hand. It trusts that, although through weakness or temptation by our spiritual enemy we fall from him by sin, yet if we return to him with true repentance, he will forgive and forget our offences for his Son's sake, our Saviour Jesus Christ. He will even make us inheritors with him of his everlasting kingdom. In the mean time, until that kingdom comes, he will be our protector and defender in all perils and dangers, whatever may happen. Though sometimes he sends us sharp adversity, yet he will always be a loving father to us, correcting us for our sin, but not withdrawing his mercy from us. So we must trust in him and commit ourselves wholly to him, hang only upon him, and call upon him, ready to obey and serve him."<br><br>"This is the true, living, and unfeigned Christian faith. It is not in the mouth and outward profession only, but it lives and stirs inwardly in the heart. This faith does not exist without hope and trust in God, nor without the love of God and of our neighbours. It does not exist without fear of God, nor without the desire to hear God's word, and to follow it in avoiding evil and doing all good works gladly. This faith, as the Bible describes it, is 'being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see'. And later it says:</p>

<blockquote><div>anyone who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him'.</div></blockquote>

<p>And nothing commends good men to God so much as this assured faith and trust in him."<br><br>"Three things should be especially noted about this faith. First, this faith does not lie dead in the heart, but is lively and fruitful in bringing forth good works. Second, without it no good works can be done that will be acceptable and pleasant to God. Third, we should note what kind of good works this faith brings forth."<br><br><br><b>Thirdly, Good Works</b><br><br>"For just as light cannot be hidden, but will show itself at one place or another, so true faith cannot be kept secret. When opportunity is offered, it will break out and show itself by good works. The living body of a man always does things appropriate to a natural and living body, for nourishment and preservation of itself, as it has need, opportunity, and occasion. In the same way the soul which has a living faith in it will always be doing some good work, which declares that it is living. It will not be unoccupied."<br><br>"Therefore, when men hear in the Scriptures such high commendations of faith - that it makes us please God, live with God, and to be the children of God - if then they imagine that they are set at liberty from doing all good works, and may live as they please, they trifle with God, and deceive themselves. It is a manifest sign that they are far from having the true and living faith, and also far from knowledge of what true faith means. For the true, sure and living Christian faith (as said before) is not just to believe all things about God which are contained in holy Scripture, but it is also an earnest trust and confidence in God. It is trusting that he cares for us and looks after us, as the father of a child whom he loves. It is knowing that he will be merciful to us for his only Son's sake, and that we have our Saviour Christ as our perpetual advocate and priest. In his merits, sacrifice, and suffering, we trust that our offences are continually washed and purged, whenever we repent truly, and return to him with our whole heart. At the same time we are steadfastly determined to obey and serve him in keeping his commandments (through his grace), and never to turn back again to sin."<br><br>"Such is the true faith that Scripture commends so much. Such faith, when it considers what God has done for us, is also moved, through continual assistance of the Spirit of God, to serve and please him. It is moved to keep his favour, to fear his displeasure, to continue his obedient children, showing thankfulness by observing his commandments. It does it freely, primarily out of true love and not for dread of punishment or love of temporal reward, knowing how much, without deserving it, we have received his mercy and pardon freely."<br><br>"This true faith will show itself, and cannot be idle for long. As it is written,</p>

<blockquote><div>The righteous man will live by faith.' </div></blockquote>

<p>He neither sleeps, nor is idle, when he should wake and be well occupied. God says by his prophet Jeremiah:</p>

                <p>Church and State in the New Millennium is the title of a new book to be published on 4 January. 'Every month, or nearly every month, I write a "Coloured Supplement" in the Jesmond Parish Church Newsletter (in the pulpit we believe we should be expounding the Bible directly). I have looked back at, and "refreshed", some of that material. I also give lectures for the Newcastle-based Christian Institute (which remarkably influenced legislation over the last decade of the twentieth century) and I write papers for Reform (the Anglican campaigning group) from time to time. I have included some of that material as well. Most of it has been rewritten. My editor suggested that I should personalize the discussion from my own experience, so there is also some autobiography. I hope this will be helpful and not self-advertising!' This I say in the introduction. (The book is published by HarperCollins, 257 pages, £16.99).<br><br>What I have written is meant to be an analysis from a Christian perspective of British and western society at the start of the new millennium. In summary, I argue for a new politics. 'A recent Lord Chancellor's Department Consultation Paper said that "recent trends in society indicate that politics is becoming more cultural or value based"' (p.viii); hence 'the current "two-party" system of government cannot give leadership in respect of these significant issues'; and hence the importance of a clear voice from the Christian Church in Public life.<br><br>Subtitled, 'issues of belief and morality for the 21st century', the book deals with research evidence on the benefits of belief. It deals with 'damaged children'; with private morality affecting public performance; with Prince Charles 'as things stand' not becoming king (p 55); and with Europe. A range of historical and philosophical issues are touched on. Important for our schools are the issues of 'multifaith' religion and 'Evolution and Creation'. Chapters entitled 'War over the Family and Abortion'; 'The Bible and Homosexuality'; and 'Stemming the Tide of Divorce' speak for themselves. The last chapters address questions of the truth of Christianity and the future of the Church, where 'denominations as we know them are probably going to become things of the past' (p 221).<br><br>The following is an extract that may be of particular interest at JPC from chapter 13, 'The Changing World and the Changing Church', (pp 209 - 217).<br><br><br><b>Starting Out</b><br><br>In late 1972 I was asked by Jim Higginbottom, the Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, where I had been on the staff as a tutor and lecturer in doctrine and ethics for a short period, if I would be willing to look at Jesmond Parish Church as a possibility for future ministry. I was willing, and I accepted the invitation to become vicar of Jesmond. I was instituted in January 1973 and have been there ever since.<br><br>When I accepted the invitation I was fairly certain it would be for a long-haul. I was told that there was a need, as Jim Higginbottom put it, to work with graduates who lived in the area. On looking at the church, it was obvious to me that it also needed to develop a significant undergraduate student ministry. With parts of the University of Newcastle in its parish, as well as the Polytechnic (now the University of Northumbria) and three top schools, along with BBC Radio Newcastle, the Civic Centre, Trades Union Headquarters and the Mansion House, it clearly could be what its founders had intended it to be when it was consecrated in 1861: a church 'in which evangelical truth shall be declared [and which would] form a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth in a large and populous town.'<br><br>The church seemed to have lost its way earlier in the twentieth century. It became, as someone put it, 'the most exclusive club in Northumberland'. It had a great musical tradition; it was also a centre for Freemasonry, but this had put a spiritual ceiling on the church. The church was, therefore, hardly Evangelical. It was a 'low' church - hostile to ritualism but not too concerned with the Bible. <br><br>All that changed with my predecessor, Roger Frith. A decided Evangelical, he preached the basic fundamentals of the faith. The result was a 'backdoor revival' - that is, many people left. It was spiritually too 'hot' for them. You could not find a more gentle man than Roger, but the clear and simple presentation of Christian truth meant that people were challenged and some did not like it. Others, however, were converted and younger people started coming to the church. Overtly Christian youth work started; and students began to attend.<br><br>When I arrived at the church in 1973 all the spadework had, therefore, been carried out. True, the numbers were small; true, much still had to be done. But I was not only convinced that God had called me to work in Newcastle and at Jesmond - I was also convinced that the church could grow.<br><br>How was it best to start? Everything I learnt from my curacy at St George's, Leeds, where I was privileged to work under Raymond Turvey, was learnt by osmosis. He told me bluntly he had no time to teach me anything; my colleague, the other curate, could teach me what was necessary. But the mere experience of working as minister to students in that large, city-centre church in Leeds, with hundreds in the congregation and more visiting its Crypt social work centre, was far more beneficial than any formal instruction. It taught me the importance of having a big vision and simple faith in God, for this was what Raymond Turvey had. For all his disclaimers, however, he did teach me three things, at least, about starting off in a new church. <br><br>The first lesson was that you must begin with prayer. The second, that you must then preach and teach the whole gospel. From day one, therefore, the Sunday preaching programme at Jesmond was of primary importance. Now, with the church having grown significantly, every sermon is published as a booklet, and is also on audio and video cassette, and on the Jesmond Parish Church website. The third lesson was that you must establish a crèche. My wife, a paediatrician, was soon put in charge of the crèche at Jesmond, where she has been responsible for hundreds of babies over the years since then. If you have a crèche run to professional standards (or better), young married couples will feel secure in leaving their babies there. Not only do you have new sources of leadership potential, you have a 'young' church. Change becomes easier and the church relates more naturally to changes in the wider culture.<br><br><br><b>Developments</b><br><br>In 1973 that was all I knew about 'church growth'. Common sense dictated a number of other things, including the need for more staff. I knew that the ministry of any church is not just that of the vicar or other paid church employees (at Jesmond at the time there was one curate and a verger who occupied the church flat). Other, non-full-time people were asked to lead in the various groups that were developing. But such growth as we were beginning to experience also required more full-time workers. There is a myth that the more you use lay people the less you need professionals or full-timers. The reverse is the case. You need more full-time staff to facilitate the work of non-full-time lay people. We started to employ extra-staff.<br><br>In view of the centralism that was developing in the Church of England during the 1970s, we decided to operate independently. This was necessary in terms of both economy and efficiency. We therefore set up the Jesmond Trust, to which congregational members could give and which could hold property and, when necessary, fund staff. The result, under God, of what we did and are doing is church growth. At the time of writing there are now over 20 on the church staff including some working part-time and with only two 'official' Anglican staff (myself and one of my clerical colleagues). These minister to a congregation now averaging over 900 different people on a Sunday, from babies to the elderly. Our regular congregation - people who genuinely treat Jesmond Parish Church as their spiritual home - is in excess of 1,000.<br><br>In the early years at Jesmond, however, life was very different and difficult. Many changes were required. It was clear that preaching and teaching the Bible had to be a top priority. It was something that urgently had to be recovered nationally in every church in the light of the serious drift following the 1960s. I was also clear that biblical preaching alone was not sufficient. There are some words of the Anglican Reformer, Richard Hooker, which I have long believed to be important. He said that the Church is 'a society and a society supernatural.'<br><br>What does that mean? Simply this: the normal dynamics of human interaction do not cease for church groups or Christian churches. A church is still 'a society', for all that it is also 'a society supernatural'. The theological axiom that grace does not deny nature but perfects it is self-evidently true. Human management skills are required of congregational leaders as well as spiritual maturity and gifts. Too many good Christian leaders, however, only concentrate on the Church being a 'society supernatural'. They preach the Bible; they pray; they care for individuals - but they have little idea how to lead and help manage 'groups', whether large or small.<br><br>In my early days at Jesmond there was no one to help me learn how to manage a growing church. For most of the time I was flying blind and using a mixture of common-sense and help from secular management teaching. Secular management teaching, however, is often inadequate because a church is not a business or a government agency. It is a voluntary non-profit organization where motivation is everything in terms of getting things done. That contrasts with a voluntary for-profit organization (a business) where financial considerations are everything; or a non-voluntary non-profit organization (like the State and its agencies), where penal sanctions can be applied.<br><br>In 1979 I went to Fuller Seminary in Pasadena, California, to their School of World Mission and their department of Church Growth, in order to 'audit' the Doctor of Ministry programme. It was stimulating. I was introduced to a whole range of thinking that was only common-sense, but in the light of my six years' experience at Jesmond, too easily ignored. I was also introduced to some authors whose writings on church management I have read avidly ever since.<br><br>All of this has led to our mission statement at Jesmond: 'Godly living, Church Growth and Changing Britain.' That is to say, there is a need for individual conversion and growth of faith in Christ. But an individual also needs to be in a lively, supportive fellowship. And then there is a duty towards the State, to see God's standards met as far as possible in the public arena.<br><br>A commitment to evangelism should mean all of this, but so often the neglected factor is a commitment to church growth. That is so necessary if the goal is not decisions but disciples. Of course, there must be no artificial creation of growth by underhand means. If there is no truth in a church, if the apostolic faith is not being taught, numerical growth will normally not occur. It is a fact, established years ago by Dean Kelly in Why Conservative Churches are Growing, that theologically liberal churches which deny or drift from the basics of the faith are usually not growing. Occasionally they do. A notorious case in Britain in 1995 was the Anglican 'Nine O'clock Service' in Sheffield, which the Archbishop of Canterbury described as 'a blow to the entire church.' These 'creation rock' services with a New Age theology attracted many, but were accompanied by abuse and a cult structure. Generally, however, it is the biblically orthodox churches which grow.<br><br>At Jesmond there has been growth that has been encouraging and, happily, more healthy. Over the last quarter of the twentieth century we saw hundreds upon hundreds of students built up in the Christian faith and then going out to other parts of the country (and the world) to work and witness for Christ. Over the last five years of the century the congregation grew by one third. This in turn helped support the student and youth work. It has been a privilege to work at Jesmond. There has been, and is, a wonderful staff team and very supportive lay leaders and congregational members. There is much to thank God for. But we cannot take the future for granted at Jesmond. There is opposition as a result of us being so firmly biblical, and this comes even from within Anglicanism. That is why, when I look out at the wider Church, particularly the Church of England, far from finding similar encouragement, there is so much that is discouraging. In fact there is a crisis in the Church at the very time when the Church should be ready for a great future and could be growing.<br><br><br><b>The 21st Century</b><br><br>Just before he died in 1976, André Malraux the French novelist and politician said, 'The twenty-first century will be religious or it will not be at all.' That is a rather cryptic but, I believe, important remark.<br><br>Richard Neuhaus, the ex-Lutheran Roman Catholic sociologist has this view of the future:<br><br>At the threshold to the Third Millennium, it seems that the alternatives to religion have exhausted themselves. That is true of the materialistically cramped rationalisms of the Enlightenment encyclopaedists, which along with ideological utopianisms, both romantic and allegedly scientific, have been consigned, as Marxists used to say, to the dustbin of history. The perversity of the human mind will no doubt produce other ideological madnesses, but at the moment it seems the historical stage has been swept clean, with only the religious proposition left standing.<br><br>In a similar vein, the distinguished Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington has written a major work on the future entitled The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. Henry Kissinger calls this 'one of the most important books to have emerged since the end of the Cold War'. Huntington's thesis is that world affairs in the nineteenth century were chiefly determined by the nation-state, and in the twentieth century by ideology; but in the twenty-first century they will be dominated by religion - by the conflict of civilizations, with civilizations being defined by cultures and cultures defined by religion. The collapse of communism does not, therefore, point to a simple worldwide embrace of democratic capitalism and Western values and vices. Rather, he sees an era of conflict that will be deep seated and endemic. And the West will be at a great disadvantage, with its Christian culture having disintegrated under an elitist imposition of a noncohesive relativism and pluralism. 'Peoples and countries with similar cultures are coming together,' writes Huntington. 'Peoples and countries with different cultures are coming apart.'<br><br>Who can deny that? You only have to look at the Balkans, the Sudan and the Indian subcontinent. It is quite frightening. Huntington's thesis is that culture is eclipsing both nationalism and ideology as the nexus of politics. And at the heart of culture, argues Huntington, is religion: 'In the modern world religion is a central, perhaps the central force that motivates and mobilizes people.'<br><br>The eight distinctive civilizations, according to Huntington, are: Islamic, Sinic (with China the core), the West (with the US the core), Orthodox (with Russia the core), Japanese, Hindu, Latin American and African. The most dangerous clashes of the future are likely to arise from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic intolerance and Sinic assertiveness. <br><br>That is the picture for the international, worldwide scene. What about the future of Western society, and society in the UK in particular? If this worldwide scenario is correct, there will be a significant process of desecularization. There will be a new consciousness regarding culture and religion. For the State this will reduce the significance of what is currently understood as the 'political' and the 'structural' and heighten the importance of the 'cultural' and the 'religious'. <br><br>David Martin, the Anglican English sociologist, seems to echo this new analysis in his study, Forbidden Revolutions. He argues against the 'misleading polarity ... between culture and structure, where the former is seen as derivative and passive and the latter as the arena of effective power and political action.' His point is that, for the past hundred years, religion and culture (and so, we may add, personal behaviour and belief) have been progressively considered marginal and part of people's private lives. The real action of life, it is said, takes place in 'the structures' and so in 'the politics of society.' But what we saw in the second half of the twentieth century, he says, was a contradiction of that. The cultural and religious margins around the world changed the so-called centre and structures - certainly in Latin America and Eastern Europe.<br><br>Martin is surely correct. Structures are subordinate; beliefs are primary. That has huge implications not just for our national corporate life but also for institutional churches, or churches with developed structures. At the end of the day, biblical and apostolic belief, prayer and straightforward evangelism - bringing men and women to faith in Christ - are central, while the structures (such as parliamentary and synodical life) are marginal. <br><br><br><b>The Crisis in the West</b><br><br>But can the West meet this new challenge? The process of secularization has so weakened the West, not only in terms of social coherence but also in terms of spiritual discernment. A public creative response to this new and emerging situation will be difficult. Secularization is not just the product of a loss of faith. It is the product of thinking that the Church and State have no relationship to each other. It has come from thinking that the Christian faith is irrelevant to everyday life and that society has no need for the truths expressed in the Bible and the Christian tradition. The effect of such secularization is ultimately to de-moralize society. It leads to the assertion that the Christian faith has nothing to say about the goals that men and women should aim for in life, or about the way they should conduct their lives once they are clear about their goals.<br><br>Secularization means that the West is ill prepared for a 'religious' twenty-first century. Calvin's claim in the sixteenth century is now not looking so foolish after all. He argued, presumably referring to Greek and Roman authors, that we could learn 'from the pagan writers'. He said,<br><br>There is not one of them who, when dealing with the duties of magistrates, law-making and the civil order, did not begin with religion and divine worship. By so doing, they all acknowledged that no polity can be well constituted, unless it makes duties owed to God its first concern, and that for laws to attend only to the well-being of men, while disregarding what is owed to God, is an absurdity.<br><br>While governments cannot legislate for faith, they can legislate to protect believers and to maintain moral standards. You cannot legislate to make people good; but you can legislate to stop the worst effects of their wrongdoing. The fact that Western governments were not always doing this in the twentieth century means that in the twenty-first century there will need to be significant spiritual renewal for the West to maintain a recognizable form of civilization. Nor should we be expecting a 'perfect' civilization from such renewal. What is wanted is simply a civilization where the majority not only admit that the Christian way of life is right and normal but also seek to shape its institutions accordingly. This will only happen as the Christian Church seeks to widen the frontiers of the kingdom of God. It can do that by increasing the number of Christians through evangelism, and by involving itself more thoroughly in all aspects of human life and society.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Philadelphia, Statistics and Costs">(February 2000) Philadelphia, Statistics and Costs</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2000</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>The seven letters to the churches in the book of Revelation are always relevant. Evangelical churches need to listen regularly to the first letter, the letter to Ephesus. This is about Christians losing 'their first love', the love they had when they first were converted or became spiritually alive - love for God and love for others. Many churches in the West currently need to listen to the fourth letter, the one to Thyatira. This makes it clear that the immoral agenda and the multi-faith agenda have to be rooted out. That is why the acceptance of extra-marital sex (and, therefore, homosexual sex) by some bishops is a 'line in the sand', as is saying Jesus Christ is not the only way. Such things must not be tolerated.<br><br>Then many others in established Protestant churches and also in some small orthodox chapels need to listen to the letter to Sardis. The people there were told 'you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.'But for many faithful Christians the sixth letter to the church in Philadelphia, Revelation 3.7-13 at the present time is a letter that needs to be read. <br><br><br><b>The letter to Philadelphia</b><br><br>"To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:</p>

<blockquote><div>7 These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 8 I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. 9 I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. 10 Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth. 11 I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. 12 Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new name. 13} He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Statistics</b><br><br>Many Christians in England today who have been faithful, who 'have kept Christ's word' and feel that they have 'little strengthy (verse 8) are aware that the situation with the church in the country is very serious. There is a slow but definite collapse going on among the churches. 'Could the end be nigh?' was a headline in the Newcastle Journal. 'The number of children attending Sunday schools has hit an all-time low, new figures reveal.' It asked 'if this spells the beginning of the end for Christianity in Britain.' <br><br>The point is this. As the new Millennium dawned the spin doctors at Church House Westminster and other denominational HQs could no longer hide the figures. Christian Research had revealed all in its survey of church attendance in England at the end of the 20th century (Peter Brierley The Tide is Running Out, Christian Research, £8.99). The church in England and the Church of England were shown to be in a dire situation. <br><br>Most of the mainline churches lost one fifth of their members or attenders during the 90's. According to the Christian Research the Church of England declined by 23 percent. This was immediately. The 'official accounts' were said to show a decline of only 17 percent (Church Times, 3 December 1999). But these 'official accounts' were calculated using a shorter period than Christian Research!<br><br>Going back 20 years Christian Research said that in 1979 5.4 million were in church on a normal Sunday; by 1989 that had dropped to 4.7 million; while by 1998 it had fallen to 3.7 million. Most frightening of all was what is happening to children and young people. At the beginning of the 20th century 56 out of 100 children were in Sunday school. Now it is 4 out of 100 children. But The Journal in its feature on children focused on Jesmond Parish Church and found that the church is bucking the trend with 250 in its Sunday youth work and 150 midweek in scouts, guides, cubs and brownies. What is happening?<br><br>So over all, or on average, the churches lost one fifth of their members or attenders during the 90's.<br><br><br><b>Mainstream Evangelicals</b><br><br>The press, however, did not pick up the one encouraging statistic that has huge significance. Across the denominations the number of people attending 'mainstream' evangelical churches (churches like JPC) over the last 10 years has increased by 68 percent (with 'broad', or more liberal, evangelicals declining by 47 percent and 'charismatic' evangelicals declining by 16 percent). <br><br>These figures when broken down for the Church of England are even more staggering. Over the last 10 years there has been, as we have seen, overall decline in the Church of England of 23 percent. But there is small growth among evangelicals (plus 2 percent) and those classified as 'low church' (plus 1 percent). But that 2 percent 'evangelical' growth was averaged from charismatic Anglican evangelicals who declined by 21 percent, broad Anglican evangelicals who declined by 23 percent, but also mainstream Anglican evangelicals who grew by an amazing 320 percent<br><br>Undoubtedly this growth has been due in part to the influence in the 90's by groups like Reform; the Proclamation Trust; churches like Jesmond and Walkergate in Newcastle and now St John's in Worcester that in a high profile way have tried to stand firm for Biblical truth; but also, and most importantly the hundreds of other Christians - clergy and lay people - who support them by prayer and when they can, by action. <br><br><br><b>The future</b><br><br>There are, however, no grounds for complacency. All Anglican evangelicals only make up 24 percent of the entire Church of England. And while in 1989 mainstream Anglican evangelicals made up a tiny 7 percent of all Anglican evangelicals, with broad then 49 percent and charismatic 44 percent, mainstream Anglican evangelicals now still only make up 29 percent, with Broad 37 percent, and Charismatic 34 percent.<br><br>But common sense suggests that in the Church of England ays that the future may well lie with mainstream Anglican evangelicals. Their concerns, their strategiesw, their analyses and their needs cannot be ignored. And they cannot be, nor are they being, ignored world-wide. Hence the importance of the 'irregular' but necessary and valid consecration of two bishops at the end of January in Singapore, one to serve as a missionary bishop of the Province of South East Asia , the other to serve as a missionary bishop of the Province of Rwanda. <br><br>A number of evangelical churches, and others, particular in America, have asked for alternative oversight, as we have in Jesmond. This is where bishops are accepting the immoral or multi-faith agendas. As none has been provided by official sources (as our Canons seem to require), two fine Primates of the Anglican communion, Archbishop Moses Tay of Singapore and Archbishop Emmanuel Kolini of Rwanda, themselves decided, together with some other bishops, enough was enough; and they ordained on 29 January 2000 two American evangelicals, Chuck Murphy and John Rodgers, to provide some alternative oversight where it is needed.<br><br><br><b>Problems</b><br><br>So all this is now the context for our work here at JPC. That is why this letter to Philadelphi is relevant. We should be encouraged by it.<br><br>The reference in verse 8 to 'an open door that no one can shut' for the Philadelphians is a wonderful promise. We don't know exactly what it was, but it was some sort of opportunity for the gospel. And we now have huge opportunities - because of the default of others. By the grace of God, while the Church of England, on average, has been declining by one third, JPC has doubled.<br><br>But as with any opportunity for evangelism there are always problems. First, the Philadelphians were, and no doubt felt, very insignificant and weak compared to the task. The risen Jesus says (verse 8):</p>

<blockquote><div>I know that you have little strength.</div></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, these Christians were being attacked by the more 'established' religious people - the Jews. The risen Jesus is blunt. These religionists are described as 'The synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars' (verse 9). The believers in Christ were and are, now, the 'true Israel' as Paul had argued in Romans 2.28. These Jews were, presumably, being unpleasant and making life difficult for these Philadelphian Christians. They were probably persecuting them.<br><br>Thirdly, there was a threat of persecution from the secular authorities as well:</p>

<blockquote><div>the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth' (verse 10).</div></blockquote>

<p>Some of these Philadelphians undoubetdly may have been tempted to keep their heads down in this situation. They said to themselves:</p>

<blockquote><div>look we have been faithful so far, (verse 8) we have "kept Christ's word and not denied his name": let's now take it easy. What more does Christ want?</div></blockquote>

<p>The answer is that Christ was wanting them to go through the open door.<br><br><br><b>Encouragements</b><br><br>The risen Jesus, through John, wants to encourage these Philadelphian Christians. And he gives encouragement, first, in verse 7 where he reminds them of who he is. Jesus speaks of ...</p>

<blockquote><div>the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.</div></blockquote>

<p>This is a claim to deity.The words 'him who is holy and true' echo Old Testament ascriptions of Jehovah (Yahweh). And Jesus is the fulfiller of promises - 'the key of David' goes back to Isaiah 22.22 and the steward of Hezekiah, Eliakim - a man of authority. Without going into details, Christ seems to be saying this:</p>

<blockquote><div>if I am the true steward of God's household, I have authority and power - far more than Eliakim. If Eliakim could open and shut the doors of the treasury in ancient Judah, I certainly can now open and shut doors.</div></blockquote>

<p>So as we face the challenges of the future we need to remember that Christ has the authority. 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me', says Jesus in Matthew 28.18. Let's be encouraged by the fact that we face those challenges (and can only face them adequately) with Christ and in his strength.<br><br>Secondly, Jesus encourages his readers by saying that in time some of these other religious folk will see the truth (verse 9):</p>

<blockquote><div>I will make them [these Jews] come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.</div></blockquote>

<p>I think we do need to be prepared at Jesmond for considerable transfer growth, now in the new millennium. People in liberal churches where the gospel is not being preached and children are not being taught, simply will come, more and more, to churches like JPC for help.<br><br>And, thirdly, Jesus encourages the Philadelphians by a promise of protection (verse 10):</p>

<blockquote><div>Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.</div></blockquote>

<p>And, fourthly, Jesus encourages them with the fact of his return and the prospect of eternity (verses 11 and 12):</p>

<blockquote><div>11 I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. 12 Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new name.</div></blockquote>

<p>A lot could be said about that. But the new Jerusalem must ultimately refer to heaven. Note the command: 'hold on to what you have'. In the current situation in the UK, churches like Jesmond can't stand still. They will either go forwards, through the open doors and grow, or they will go backwards.To make no effort when the tide is going strongly in the opposite direction, is to drift. To make progress against the tide always requires great effort. The only option, therefore, is for us to plan to grow at Jesmond. We, therefore, have to increase our work and increase our ministry. That seems a clear calling. But it will be costly in terms of time and money. A vast a mount of the ministry of the church is by those who give their time quite freely. But an increase of time freely given in ministry always means the need of more 'facilities' and equipment, plus more full time work in co-ordinating and resourcing. That is why there are then increased financial needs with any increase in ministry.<br><br><br><b>The cost</b><br><br>This is the time of year we think about money. It is time for our annual Giving Review. This coming year we must increase our giving. Our income must increase hugely, if we are going to do the work, we believe, God has called us to do.<br><br>As has been explained in the Giving Review, current figures show that out of every 100 people present on a Sunday, 44 are students or under 18; 10 are retired or unwaged; 7 are visitors, and 39 - just over one third - are members who are regular wage earners. It follows that one third has to bear a large proportion of the costs of our church. And there are now additional problems with the economic situation in the North East. But God is good, and with him nothing is impossible.<br><br>While some are finding life financially hard there are those of us who are single people with good incomes, or in double income families with no children, or are older people with more disposable income now their children are off their hands. And there are all sorts of other people in between who are not really in too difficult a situation. <br><br>The problem is that all of us are tempted to be caught up in the prevailing religion of materialism. That is one reason why we need to pray against temptation.<br><br>And we need to pray that money is given this year to release God's work here at Jesmond. It will be hard, because of this prevailing materialism and the desire for financial security. Nor is it wrong to want security. But it is wrong if it is at the expense of the gospel, and rather foolish - as God alone can only provide true security. Moths, rust and thieves have to be contended with in the normal run of things, as Jesus so eloquently once said.<br><br>So we all need to recognise the need for prayer. The Giving Review should start and continue with prayer. If we are not one of today's 'winners' financially, we can work for the Lord by praying, in faith, for the financial needs to be met. If, however, you are one of todays 'winners', you need to pray not only for yourself not to be tempted, but also that, if you see the need and have the vision and the will to give, others also will have that vision. That is why all of us, therefore, need to pray.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Who is willing to spend five minutes a day praying for the Giving Review and that all the financial needs will be met? Who really wants to be part of JPC moving forward. Who is saying to themselves, 'it can't stand still, but it will be costly to move forward. So I will pray at least for five minutes every day over this Giving Review period.'<br><br>Already there are great encouragements. Over the period the Church of England dclined by two-thirds, JPC doubled in size. The youth work is good, so is the work among women.<br><br>But looked at carefully, prayerfully, and responsibly, it becomes obvious that this church can only go forward, if this year there is a great increase in ministry (that means money at some point)<br><br>I believe God can and will provide. He can do so miraculously when necessary - that is to say, by external gifts of huge sums - we've experienced that in the past. <br><br>But perhaps at the moment a large proportion of us, need to be the answers to our own prayers before we expect that kind of miracle.<br><br><br><b>Summary</b><br><br>So these Philadelphians were faithful. They felt they were a tiny minority. And they were being opposed by the more powerful Jews. But Jesus tells them there is an open door. He encourages them by the fact of his authority; by the fact that people will come to them as they see the truth they have been witnessing to; by a promise of protection and by the reality of his second coming and eternity.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Paganization, Adoption and Discrimination">(March 2000) Paganization, Adoption and Discrimination</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2000</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Paganization</b><br><br>The Paganizing or the anti-Christianizing of our society has been in the headlines during February. There was the Government's desire in the new Local Government Bill to allow local authorities, at Council Tax-Payers' expense, 'intentionally to promote homosexuality' and 'promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.' This they are wanting to achieve through a clause in the Bill that repeals 'Section 28'. They improperly said that Section 28 was a cause of bullying. That was quite contrary to the evidence of the survey they cited, as Kevin Glazebrook, Professor of Statistics at Newcastle, has pointed out. Section 28 is simply a necessary protection against the sexual subversion of children. It was a great answer to many prayers when Baroness Young's amendment secured the defeat of the Government at the Committee stage of the new Bill on 7 February in the House of Lords. But, of course, the battle is not over yet.<br><br>Baroness Young was not helped in the debate by the official line of the Church of England - represented by the Bishop of Blackburn (other bishops, however, were supportive). The Bishop of Blackburn was wanting to substitute Section 28 with a new clause on guidelines about marriage. Of course it would be good to strengthen teaching in our schools about the importance of heterosexual marriage. But it is vital at the same time to continue to prohibit 'the intentional promotion of homosexuality'. This would seem to be the majority public opinion. 76 percent nation-wide voted 'No!' in an ITV poll to the question 'should children be taught that homosexuality is an acceptable lifestyle?' on 10 February. <br><br><br><b>Counselling Out</b><br><br>The focus of Section 28 is children and young people. Children were also the focus of the second piece of evidence for the Paganizing and the anti-Christianizing of our culture. Channel 4 TV is currently running an Adoption on Trial series of programmes. On 10 February (the same night as the poll) one of the Dispatches programmes was entitled 'The Fight for a Child'. It dealt with Britain's current adoption crisis and how certain perfectly good prospective parents are 'counselled out' by adoption agencies and so prevented from adopting. I first came across counselling out in the case of a fine Christian man I know through the Christian Institute who together with his wife were excluded from fostering because of their views over this very issue of homosexuality. When questioned about their beliefs and attitudes they gently said they would be 'uncomfortable' with a child who wanted to be homosexually active. For holding such views they were deemed unsuitable by the agency - and the agency was Barnardo's!<br><br>Knowing that this sort of thing was going on, I was not surprised by revelations in the Dispatches programme. But they were shocking nonetheless. At one point in the programme the narrator was dealing with people being excluded and she referred to the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF). Here is a transcript of what followed - after a woman from BAAF had spoken, the picture cut to a woman whose face was never revealed but who was called 'Linda'.<br><br><br><b>'The Fight for a Child'</b><br><br>Narrator: BAAF discovered another surprising group was also being ruled out. <br><br>BAAF official: A very interesting one we have begun to notice - people who have a religious affiliation that is not absolutely mainstream C of E, and where they practise that religion. <br><br>A Parent [Linda]: There was one particular local authority - I contacted them about a little boy; and I was saying, 'Look are we the appropriate age? We are Christians. This is what our life is like. What do you think?' And she said, 'Not only do I think that the child is not suitable for your lifestyle, I don't think any child from the care system can fit into your lifestyle.'<br><br>Narrator: Linda and her husband are active members of their local Baptist church and read the Bible every day at home. They are now in the process of adopting a six year old boy; but it has taken two years to persuade a local authority their strong Christian faith is something positive.<br><br>Linda: We feel that as Christians we have received from God unconditional love and it's something that we can give these children; and you know children are just missing out; and it's so sad.<br><br>Narrator: They were prepared to adopt one child who might have been sexually abused, but the social worker rejected them. One of the reasons given is quite extraordinary.<br><br>Linda: She said, 'You and your husband haven't lived with anybody else before you got married.' And I said to her, 'Well, you know why - you know that's because we're Christians.' And so she said, 'We feel you're not sexually mature enough for this child.'<br><br>The final piece of evidence for the Paganizing and anti-Christianizing of our culture relates both to adoption and homosexuality. This time it concerns my own wife of whom I have never written before in a Coloured Supplement; but this needs to be reported.<br><br><br><b>Dr Joy Holloway</b><br><br>There have been two doctors who are the Medical Advisers to the Newcastle upon Tyne Social Services Adoption Panel. One, a GP, has dealt with the adult prospective adopters. The other, a Paediatrician, has dealt with the children, many of whom, as we know, will be highly vulnerable and damaged for a range of reasons. The Paediatrician has been my wife, Joy, an Associate Specialist Community Paediatrician, who specializes in Adoption and Fostering. As a committed Christian she is also one of the few medical doctors that has the courage nationally to speak out on the wrongness of placing children with practising lesbian or male homosexual adopters - both for moral reasons and for not being in the best interests of the children from the point of view of the healthy development of the child. She reports that after she has spoken out people regularly say in private they are in agreement with her, but they are unwilling to say so publicly.<br><br>On 18 January she was called to see two senior social work managers at the Civic Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne, and was told that there was no criticism of her work but that Social Services wanted her and the other medical doctor to cease to be Medical Advisers to the Adoption Agency and to cease to attend the Adoption Panel from 1 March 2000. However, Social Services would like her to continue to see the children for their medicals. They said they wanted another doctor to be the Medical Adviser to the adoption agency and only this new person would attend the Adoption Panel and so be party to the decisions on the children. The other current Medical Adviser, however, would continue to be on the Fostering Panel.<br><br>Joy said first that she thought it would not work with one doctor seeing the children and another one presenting information to the Panel on children they had not seen. She did not think this was in the best interests of the children. Secondly, she asked if the new arrangements were because she had expressed her views very clearly that it is morally wrong and not in the best interests of children to place them with practising lesbian or male homosexual carers. She was told this was not the primary reason for demoting her. However, she is concerned that this is discrimination on religious grounds.<br><br><br><b>History and Conclusion</b><br><br>In 1985 Joy was appointed to be a Medical Adviser to the Adoption and Fostering Unit and she was a voting member of the Panel for both Adoption and Fostering. In 1990 she spoke out against lesbian adoption in a case that had a national profile and where the court later reversed the Social Services' decision which she had all along opposed - this is documented in my new book Church and State in the New Millennium, (HarperCollins, London, 2000), pp. 19-26. She was then demoted to being a non-voting member of the Adoption and Fostering Panel. <br><br>In summer 1999 she had a correspondence with Margaret Asquith, the new Head of Children's Services, Newcastle Social Services Directorate, again saying she thought it wrong to place children with practising homosexuals. In Autumn 1999 she was excluded from the Fostering Panel. In January 2000 they wanted to remove her from the Adoption Panel and set up a system which is likely to be unworkable. A different senior Community Paediatrician, who is not a young person and who has not specialized in Adoption and Fostering, has now been asked by Social Services to be the new Medical Adviser from 1 March.<br><br>Newcastle Social Services do not have a good record. The 1990 case was quite disgraceful. It appears, under Margaret Asquith, to be accepting of homosexual parenting and of placing vulnerable children in such 'pretended family relationships' (Section 28). In terms of morality (and the clear teaching of the Bible) this is wicked. But ignoring morality, the evidence is that children can suffer developmentally. In a well reported study one quarter of the young adults from lesbian households became involved 'in same-gender sexual relationships' themselves, whereas none of the participants from the heterosexual single-parent control group did. That compares with only 2 percent of this age group in the general population who have ever had a homosexual relationship. Homosexual adoption and fostering, like the repeal of Section 28, has to be opposed.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Reflections on a Sabbatical">(September 2000) Reflections on a Sabbatical</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2000</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>A recipe for church decline is to have a vicar or minister for a short time - three or four years - and then make sure he moves on. Apparently four years is now the average time a Protestant clergyman in the US stays in his job. It probably is not much different in the UK. Growing congregations, however, usually have long-stay clergy. The reason is simple. It takes a pastor four, five or six years to get to know a church and its social dynamics. So it is folly for him to move on before he knows the ropes or just at the point he can begin to be really productive. <br><br>The reason so many move on, I am sure, is that they feel a need for a break or a change. They feel they are getting stale or exhausted. Many lay people (and a number of church officials) fail to realise how draining the full-time ordained ministry can be. Six years is the most many people can survive in one place. So moving on is a simple solution. <br><br>There are, of course, other unproductive solutions. One is to change the emphasis of your ministry. Instead of persevering in the important and hard tasks of parish leadership and faithful Bible teaching, some try a totally new doctrinal emphasis - from extreme charismatic to extreme liberal; others try new pastoral techniques based on dubious psychology. Most tragic of all is when someone leaves his wife and goes off with another woman. Sadly Roy Clements, a well-known Baptist clergyman, has recently made an exit from his Cambridge church by leaving is wife and going off with another man!<br><br>However, the best solution is to take a sabbatical. That is why the pastoral staff at JPC have sabbaticals for three months every seven years. And that is why I was completely away from the church mid-March to mid-June. I am extremely grateful to my colleagues for enabling this to happen - inevitably some of them have had to take on further responsibilities. And particularly I want to thank Jonathan Pryke for his leadership while I have been away. <br><br>As the vicar I also have a second period of nearly three months back in Jesmond but not "up front" or directly involved in leadership. I get involved in a number of things behind the scenes in the church; I visit other churches; I get involved in wider church issues; I preach (elsewhere); I do some broadcasting and writing; and, especially, I try to give thought to the future both at Jesmond and further afield. But an important reason why I need to be away a bit longer than three months is this: it is necessary not just that the senior pastor of a church has a break, but that the church has a break from its senior pastor. There needs to be a time interval – a sort of interregnum. The taking of new responsibilities by others in the church is a good thing. And change, if necessary, is more acceptable in the new phase of the church's life that follows the clergyman's return. People are ready for it.<br><br>This has been my fourth sabbatical at JPC. I have followed this pattern on each occasion. So what have I been discovering over this period? And what is my thinking now?<br><br><br><b>The wider world and the UK</b><br><br>First, let me make a brief comment about the wider world. I was privileged in March and April to be able to go, literally, around the world visiting churches and individual leaders in a number of countries. And for the first time on such a journey my wife was able to accompany me. We spent five weeks visiting Toronto (Canada), Los Angeles (USA), Whangerei (New Zealand), Sydney and Cairns (Australia) [Cairns for a two day break and where we were in emergency mode with a cyclone bearing down on us], Tokyo (Japan), Hong Kong (now, China), Johannesburg (South Africa), Cape Town (South Africa) and back to Newcastle. <br><br>For us the greatest encouragement was in South Africa where we visited the Church of England in South Africa (CESA). CESA is evangelical and the Anglican church that is not in (technical) communion with the C of E. The "recognized" Anglican church is the Church of the Province of South Africa (CPSA) which is more Anglo-Catholic and liberal. But it is CESA that is growing and thriving.<br><br>It was a CESA church, St James, in Kennilworth, Cape Town, where there was a terrible massacre one Sunday evening a few years ago. Gunman stormed into the church and sprayed the huge congregation with bullets. The wife of the administrator of Christ Church, Midrand, Johannesburg (where we were staying and where Bishop Martin Morrison, who visited Jesmond in June, is the rector) was shot and killed that night along with a number of others. Many more were injured. But that experience of suffering has led to spiritual and numerical growth. St James was in great heart when we visited it. So is the denomination as a whole, with congregations increasing in size and also in numbers through church planting.<br><br>It is, of course, not unusual to see spiritual health in Africa and other non-Western countries. This is part of a new "shift". Over the last century globally Christianity has expanded from half a billion people in 1900 to two billion in 2000. The significance, however, is not so much in the numbers. These were just keeping up with population trends. The Christian community is still only 33 percent of the world's population, similar to the proportion one hundred years earlier. No! The real change is in the demographic shift that has taken place in global Christianity. <br><br>In 1900 Christians in Europe and North America were over 80 percent of that 33 percent of the world's Christian population. At the end of the century that 80 percent had shrunk to less than 40 percent. According to the International Bulletin of Missionary Research, "today it is the non-Western world that boasts the majority - more than 60 percent of the globe's Christian population." Christian life and growth is now in the non-Western world. By contrast the situation in the West, especially in Europe, is generally depressing. There is both heresy and decline - the two being related. We found, however, good things in the West, in non-episcopal churches in the United States and in the Anglican diocese of Sydney, Australia.<br><br>But what of the UK? Yes, there are good churches that are faithful and relevant. But overall there is decline and a lack of confidence in the Gospel. On none of my previous sabbaticals have I been so saddened by the situation in Britain and Europe. Nor is this any idealization of the past. It fits in with reliable statistics. The Gallup International Millennium Survey consulted 50,000 people across 60 countries. It discovered, as one headline put it, that "Europe 'leads the world in godlessness'." To the question "How important is God in your life?" and on a scale of 1-10, 97 percent of West Africans, 87 percent of Latin Americans, 83 percent of North Americans had a score of 7-10. But only 49 percent of Europeans had a score of 7-10 (South East Asia had even less – 47 percent). With regard to attending religious services, 82 percent of West Africans attend at least once a week, 47 percent of North Americans, 35 percent of Latin Americans, 27 percent of South East Asians, but only 20 percent of Western Europeans and 14 percent of Eastern Europeans. <br><br>Last year's English Church Attendance Survey from Christian Research showed we in England are as bad as anywhere. The Survey showed that only 7.5 percent of the population of England was in church on an average Sunday. In 1979 (using the same measurements) it was 12 percent. And the Survey suggested that the rate of decline is increasing. Things are bad.<br><br>Then, another test – TV and radio. Normally I have little time to watch TV or listen to the radio. But I have had more time to do that over the past months. What is now clear to me is that there has been an increase of decadence both in terms of sexual explicitness; in terms of editorial bias against Christian beliefs and Christian moral standards; and in terms of "religious broadcasting". Religious broadcasting often seems to present an inter-faith philosophy (that is, of course, not neutral) with "token" Christians who rarely mention Jesus, and if they do it is seldom as the saviour from sin. The result is a pooling of ignorance, banality and political correctness; low ratings; and then, presumably, programme controllers saying, "We told you so, the public does not want religion on TV or radio."<br><br><br><b>The eighteenth century</b><br><br>It is, however, no good simply complaining. In my annual reading of Bishop Ryle's Christian Leaders of the 18th Century I have once again been struck by how similar Britain of the 21st century is to Britain – or at any rate, England and Wales - of the 18th century. Immorality and decadence was rife then (see Hogarth's paintings) and the Christian faith was despised. Bishop Butler – a former Bishop of Durham – said that Christianity was becoming "a principal subject for mirth and ridicule." That was no wonder. The Bible was not being taught or preached. <br><br>The distinguished lawyer, Blackstone, early in the reign of George III tried to hear every London clergyman who had some sort of a reputation. Ryle reports that "he did not hear a single discourse which had more Christianity in it than the writings of Cicero, and that it would have been impossible for him to discover, from what he heard, whether the preacher were a follower of Confucius, of Mahomet or of Christ!" So what is new? And where there was "religion" in those days, it was often a "religion of Nature" with Jesus subordinate to human thinking. We today would call it a form of "New Agism". Ryle says, "the majority of the bishops … were unfit for their position" while the vast majority of the parochial clergy "seemed determined to know everything except Jesus Christ and him crucified." And "their sermons were so unspeakably and indescribably bad, that it is comforting to reflect they were generally preached to empty benches." And Free Church preachers were no better.<br><br>So how did things change? How was it that by the end of the next century the majority of the nation's children were in Sunday School every Sunday?<br><br>The answer is that God raised up individuals – not from established leaders at the top of the Church of England or at the top of the "dissenting" movements, but from the bottom. They were mostly ordinary Anglican clergymen, raised up about the same time in various parts of the country. They did God's work in God's way. Ryle summarizes their work as follows:<br><br>They did [God's] work in the old apostolic way, by becoming the evangelists of their day. They taught one set of truths. They taught them in the same way, with fire, reality, earnestness, as men fully convinced of what they taught. They taught them in the same spirit, always loving, compassionate, and, like Paul, even weeping, but always bold, unflinching, and nor fearing the face of man. And they taught them on the same plan, always acting on the aggressive; not waiting for sinners to come to them, but going after, and seeking sinners; not sitting idle till sinners offered to repent, but assaulting the high places of ungodliness.<br><br>And these men - such as George Whitefield, John Wesley, Grimshaw of Haworth, William Romaine, Daniel Rowlands, John Berridge, Henry Venn, Walker of Truro, Hervey of Weston Flavell, Toplady and Fletcher of Madeley, under God, changed England and Wales. And it was through their preaching. They preached everywhere - inside churches and outside; in their own parishes and in other people's parishes if the gospel demanded it. They preached simply, so that people could understand. They preached fervently – "with fiery zeal, like men who were thoroughly persuaded that what they said was true, and that it was of the utmost importance to your eternal interest to hear it." And what they preached was "eminently doctrinal, positive, dogmatical, and distinct." They were crystal clear that the Bible was to be supreme; that human nature was corrupt, sinful, spiritually dead and in desperate need of saving; that the first step in making men and women good is to show them that they are utterly bad; and the second step is to persuade them of the paradox that doing the best for your soul is when you are convinced that you can do nothing at all, but Christ can.<br><br>So this was the context for their teaching and preaching of the "good news" about Jesus Christ. He had done for mankind all that was necessary, in his death on the cross where he bore our guilt and made satisfaction for our sins. He was not just an example, but a sacrifice, "the just for the unjust". They taught that the one thing necessary from men and women is "faith" - simply to trust, thankfully, in the goodness and grace of God in Christ. In this way they can become new beings with new life by the Holy Spirit. And this new life will lead to personal holiness with love for God and love for our neighbour. Finally they taught, as equally true, both God's eternal hatred of sin and God's love for the sinner. They never failed to teach about the wonder of heaven or the awfulness of hell. <br><br>So these were the truths they taught. And as people responded under the conviction of the Holy Spirit, they and the country were changed.<br><br><br><b>The "Bondage of the Will"</b><br><br>Isn't this what we need at the start of this new Millennium? From my reading over my Sabbatical I have come to the conclusion that it is not just the world that is decadent. Christians are as well. We have slipped – nor is it just "them" (the multi-faith, sexually permissive, ultra-feminist, liberal Christians), but "us". I was shocked to discover that in America, according to the Barna Research Group, while 23 percent of married non-Christians get divorced, it is 27 percent of "born again" Christians (4 percent more). And in terms of other behaviours there is no great difference between "born again" Christians and non-Christians. <br><br>Then there is basic theology. Over the past months, among other things, I have been reading some of the works of the 16th Reformers including the Anglican Book of Homilies. This is a foundation document of the Church of England, written mostly by Cranmer and Jewel, referred to in the 39 Articles but now out of print and unobtainable. <br><br>From my reading it is evident how much of contemporary so-called "evangelicalism" seems to bear little relationship to what our forefathers taught (and died for). Take Luther's Bondage of the Will. It is an aggressive and polemical book – an attack on Erasmus. Today we would all be far more polite. But he is teaching simple biblical theology. He is explaining the absolute sovereignty of God. God is in control. So all the sad (and pathetic) individuals that were (and are) giving corrupt leadership in the world, and, yes, the church are totally under God's control. Nothing happens without his ordering. Nor says Luther should we be surprised at the mess we are in. It is due to the fact that the human will just cannot do good, of itself. It is "in bondage" to selfishness and sin. Only if God acts, is there any hope. But the good news is, and this cannot be overstressed, God has acted. That is why the historical material of the Bible is so important. And God has acted to "save". There is hope - in Christ, but only in Christ, on Calvary and through faith in him. And that action is the most important thing in the history of the Universe. <br><br>That is what Luther, Calvin and Cranmer actually believed. But many of us today, it seems, only "half-believe" it, if at all. At least, it often does not undergird our world-view. Our thinking, our priorities and our values are too often conditioned by secular views. Nor is that surprising when, according to Barna, "the average Christian spends more time watching television in one evening than he or she spends reading the Bible during the entire week." The result is that "when asked to describe the ends they live for, the top items most American Christians reported were good health, a successful career, a comfortable lifestyle, and a functional family. The average Christian assumes that when we are happy, God is happy." And "a large majority of Christians contend that the true meaning of our earthly existence is simply to enjoy life and reap as much fulfilment as we can from our daily pursuits." I am sure similar figures could be found for the UK. But this is so different from St Paul who wanted "to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings" (Philippians 3.15).<br><br><br><b>The way ahead</b><br><br>What then is the way ahead? I am convinced that there needs to be a new consciousness developed among Christians in the United Kingdom. In the months that lie ahead I hope to be able to spell all this out a little more. This Coloured Supplement is just to set the context and explain the needs.<br><br>First, there needs to be a new consciousness about our spiritual needs, both personal and social. I will not elaborate on specific social issues such as the Christian Institute is rightly dealing with, nor on the more "systemic" social issues – issues in the NHS, education, business, the police, even the armed forces and certainly the Government. Nor are these unconnected with our spiritual malaise. But if the only hope for all these needs is ultimately from spiritual revival and a work of the Holy Spirit, prayer is the number one requirement – believing prayer. Jesus taught that the Holy Spirit is given as men and women pray (Luke 11.12).<br><br>Secondly, there needs to be a new consciousness about the need for us all – not just clergy and church workers, but especially lay people to talk to their friends, families and colleagues about God, his truth, his purposes and his love. For that to happen, in a situation where even many good Christian people are biblically illiterate, there needs to be a programme of "biblical literacy" for all.<br><br>Thirdly, there needs to be a new consciousness about the need for leadership development for the church (but also for the world). At the start of the millennium there is a terrible dearth of good, principled leadership. That is a consequence of the current ideology of relativism where all views are right and nothing is wrong. Good leaders, however, have to believe on key occasions that they are right and others are wrong. If you lead by simply following public opinion, that, of course, is not leadership but "followership". That is fine if the crowd is always right. According to the Bible, however, the crowd will more often than not be wrong. We need to train leaders, who are more than just teachers. But Christian leaders must be "biblically literate" as a minimum.<br><br>Fourthly, there needs to be a new consciousness about alternative structures for evangelism. The parochial structure of the Church of England, good for the past, is now inhibiting evangelism. Evangelism in the modern, suburban and metropolitan world cannot be territorial. You don't just relate (and so talk) to people from a small geographical area. You relate through networks that have to do with work, leisure, special interests, sport and families across whole regions, such as Tyneside. Our individual evangelism, therefore, needs to follow these networks as we talk with people we know and with whom we have influence. A serious programme of evangelism, in this situation, will mean new structures. These are evolving in other parts of the world where churches are growing. We need to learn from them.<br><br>Finally, there needs to be a new consciousness about the family – and the married family. The Christian family - understood as a father and mother committed together for life, in a relationship recognized by the State – has always been the "base" unit of the Church. It has been the "church in the house". We need encourage such families, and as a church make better provision for the role Christian parents have in the Christian nurture of their children – a role that cannot always be delegated. I believe we need a new consciousness along all these lines.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Politics and Pornography">(October 2000) Politics and Pornography</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2000</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Who cares?</b><br><br>Autumn is the season for party political conferences. But it seems there is less and less of an interest in what goes on. There is a growing disenchantment with politics and a growing loss of confidence in politicians. <br><br>The current House of Commons was elected by a turnout in the 1997 General Election that was lower than in any previous post-war election: it was only 71.5 percent. In a recent poll 72 percent of people agreed that "parties are only interested in people's votes, not in their opinions," while 60 percent agreed that "it doesn't really matter which party is in power. In the end things go on much the same." The disillusionment with European Parliamentary politics is even greater than with UK politics to judge from the 24 percent turnout in the 1999 European elections: the 1998 English local elections were slightly higher with a 30 percent turnout.<br><br>Part of the problem undoubtedly is the failure of the "party system". The parties are now dysfunctional. It is not sufficiently realised that the public issues - the issues in which people are interested, over which they divide, and on which they want to be represented - are no longer the old economic and employment issues of the last century. In the 21st century the issues are moral and religious. At least the Lord Chancellor's Department has begun to see this. <br><br>"Recent trends in society," said a department Consultation Paper, "indicate that politics is becoming more cultural or value based." It spoke of "a variety of issues including sex, homosexuality, education, religion, drugs and single parents" as key "post-material non-economic concerns" for public life.<br><br>Most today agree on the need for a healthy economy, good medical care for all, less unemployment, better living standards and environmental sanity. That is why the perception that "in the end things go on much the same" whichever party is in power is fair enough - at least in these areas. Most people in their better moments realize that no political solution to a public problem will be perfect. So they tolerate genuine attempts motivated for the public interest. <br><br>What is not tolerated by a significant number is manipulation motivated by a desire to overturn received morality and to introduce decadence. Invariably there will be resistance and protest. But such protests over moral and religious matters come not only from the general population. They come also from within each of the parties. However, foolish party bosses, in the interests of a supposed unity and inclusivity, develop lowest common denominator policies. This means, by definition, that the "lowest" position - that of the immoralists - wins every time. The result is disunity and the exclusion of those concerned for morality.<br><br>But should morality and politics be mixed up? Should religion, should Christianity be mixed up with politics? These are important questions as, undoubtedly, we will soon be in the run-up to a General Election.<br><br><br><b>Two errors</b><br><br>Classically there have been two errors for Christians as they think about politics. <br><br>First, there is the error of those who think that the only duty laid on a Christian is to preach the gospel in terms of introducing men and women to faith in Christ. The Christian faith is, they say, concerned only with spiritual issues; and the only public duty Christians have is to obey their rulers - an obedience Paul talks about in Romans 13. This is the error of undervaluing the political order.<br><br>Secondly, there is the error of those who think that the way to establish Christ's kingdom is only by politics. They point to the Prophets in the Old Testament who championed the poor and to Christ who "liberated" the sick and demon-possessed. So the Christian faith, they say, needs to focus not on heaven in the future but on working now for health, wealth and prosperity. The Christian mission is not to "save souls" but to promote what is called "a social Gospel." This is the error of overvaluing the political order.<br><br>So how does the Bible encourage us to think about these things? Paul told Timothy that there must be prayer for politics and for evangelism:</p>

<blockquote><div>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Saviour, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2.2)</div></blockquote>

<p>We are to pray for a political order that ensures protection for life, limb and property ("peaceful and quiet lives") and that ensures freedom to worship, evangelize and live morally ("in all godliness and holiness"). Such a state of affairs is objectively "good and pleases God". It also would seem to assist God's twofold desire for evangelism ("all men to be saved") and teaching ("to come to a knowledge of the truth").<br><br>But it is obvious we are not only to pray, but, certainly in the United Kingdom, we are to act. If it is right to pray for something because it is God's will, and if also we have an opportunity to bring about God's will by our actions, not to act is disobedient. Furthermore, in a democracy we are the authorities of Romans 13. We are God's servants in the political realm. We are to be "agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer" (Romans 13.4). Of course that is not an entitlement to take the law into our own hands. We delegate legislation and the administration of the law to Parliament. But it means we have the responsibility to work for Parliament to legislate for a just and moral society and for the fair punishment of public wrongdoing.<br><br>Nor are we all called to be involved actively - although after the sad showing in September by Newcastle City Council in their licensing of Xsensual and in their publicly advertizing for homosexual adopters in spite of the harm done to children, it is clear that we need more committed Christian councillors. Nor are we all called to be engaged in public lobbying - although when the Christian Institute does that on our behalf, we can pray, give financially and help in a number of ways, not least by writing letters.<br><br>But we all need to develop a consciousness that concern in the public realm is not an optional extra for the believer. We are to seek God's will for the whole of life Monday to Saturday: not just on Sunday.<br><br><br><b>"Good, pleasing and perfect"</b><br><br>It is vital, however, to realize that "public life" is not limited to Parliament and the structures of Government. The "Public Square" in a democracy is not coterminous with "Parliament Square".<br><br>"Intermediate communities" between Parliament and local authorities on the one hand, and between the individual, on the other hand, are vital for the health of the public realm. Pre-eminent in these "intermediate communities" is the family.<br><br>No society can survive long the disintegration of its families - and the family understood as the "married family" not the modern counterfeit of the "love family". Particularly for the care and nurture of children there needs to be a unit where a man and women are committed together for life. And for that to be possible the relationship needs to be held together by more than emotional ties. Emotional ties come and go. The relationship of a man and a woman for permanence needs external, social and institutional support. That is what marriage is all about. Marriage provides that support. That is why societies universally (if they are not disintegrating) privilege marriage. But marriage and the married family is now under attack. There have been two self-conscious sources for that attack. <br><br>First, there has been the Marxist attack on the family in Russia that came to a head in the 1920's and the Marxist attack in Western Europe in the 1960's in a new form under Herbert Marcuse and his many disciples. This sought to displace the Christian sex and marriage ethic with an ultra-libertarianism and extreme feminism. It resulted in a cocktail of heterosexual decadence, evidenced not least in a growing pornography industry. The Russian dissident Igor Shafarevich, in his book The Socialist Phenomenon speaks of "the Socialist project of homogenizing society". He says it ...</p>

<blockquote><div> ... demands that the family be vitiated or destroyed. This can be accomplished in good measure by profaning conjugal love and breaking monogamy's link between sex and loyalty. Hence, in their missionary phases Socialist movements often stress sexual 'liberation'.</div></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, there has been the Nazi attack on the family by the elevation of homosexuality. Many of the early Nazis had the ideal of displacing the Christian sex and marriage ethic with a return to a pre-Christian Graeco-Spartan ethic. They gloried in the macho-warrior type who was active in the homosexual relationship while despising the passive partner as effeminate. The Nazi roots of modern homosexuality are important in the progressive homosexualization of the West that is now being evidenced in the request for so called "gay marriage" (see the paper Homosexuality and the Nazi Party by Scott Lively).<br><br>But some Christians are nervous over getting involved in any of these issues partly because they do not believe in the real "goodness" of God's will. There has been another dangerous error in the history of the church. It is when people think that God's will is, as it were, neutral. His "pure will" defines what is good, they say; there is, therefore, nothing inherently good in what God wills. For example - and to take an extreme example - if God had chosen, he could have made killing good and saving life bad. And so there is no reason for obeying God. All obedience must be blind.<br><br>Now, of course, the believer often has to obey God "blindly", like Abraham in the Old Testament who "obeyed and went" out from Haran, "even though he did not know where he was going" (Hebrews 11.8). But Abraham knew that God was good and all would be well for everyone, himself included. The essence of faith is not only believing that God exists. True faith is believing that God is good: "anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him" (Hebrews 11.6).<br><br>God's commands are inherently good, not because there is some divine "goodness" out there in eternity that is bigger than God! No! It is simply that God is the creator and all he has made is good, and to be good is to go along the grain of creation. It is living in harmony with God's creation intention which is the production of life and existence and not death and annihilation. As Paul says in Romans 12 verse 2, God's will is "good, pleasing and perfect."<br><br><br><b>Family breakdown and pornography</b><br><br>It follows that if you defy God's will you will suffer long term but also quite often in the short term. It is defying the maker's instructions. This is seen no more clearly than in these issues relating to the family.<br><br>On 14 September a Parliamentary report entitled "The Cost of Family Breakdown" and commissioned by the Lords and Commons Family and Child Protection group gave some startling figures. According to the Newcastle Evening Chronicle it "put the cost of family breakdown at around £15 billion-a-year and said children from broken homes started out in life with a 'huge man-made handicap'."<br><br>The report argued that "each failed relationship produces pain and emotional hurt, creating an incalculable cost in human misery. The whole society is affected by the social consequences of family breakdown ... Family breakdown impairs the health of the nation, reduces the educational achievement of its children, increases the crime rate, places a burden on the national economy and a strain on social relationships."<br><br>£15 billion are the "open" direct costs. That averages around £11 a week for every UK tax-payer, or one third of Government expenditure on education or a quarter of the annual NHS bill! There are probably a further £15 billion hidden costs. Cohabitation, gay-parenting, so called "new family forms" are all damaging for children. This is now a fact of social science, in the same way as it is a fact of medical science that smoking damages your health. But lies are perpetuated that God's way for sexual and family relationships is not necessary. The very same week that this report came out Jerry Hall, the former wife of Mick Jagger, was advising parents in an unhappy marriage to divorce. But she was ignoring the famous 1994 Exeter University study by John Tripp and M.Cockett. They found that a bad marriage is often better than a good divorce for the children.<br><br>Even more shocking were the remarks of the judge, Mr Justice Collins, in the Judicial Review of the decision by Newcastle City Council to grant the single blanket licence to allow a three day sex market to take place at the Newcastle Arena. The report from the Christian Institute includes these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>we were ... astonished by the Judge's suggestion that sex offenders would benefit from attending a sex exhibition.</div></blockquote>

<p>But what are the facts about pornography? As with smoking and the damage caused by the evolution of non-traditional families the evidence of harm is clear. A report from the American Commission on pornography agreed that there is a causal link between violent pornography and aggressive behaviour towards women. Also it said that exposure to sexually explicit material that is not violent but nevertheless degrades women - a category that "constitutes somewhere between the predominant and overwhelming portion of what is currently standard fare heterosexual pornography ... [bears] some causal relationship to the level of sexual violence." Then there is the harm to the models and actors involved in pornographic productions. There is a process of sexual desensitization going on. One actor in a nude play said: "Initially, perhaps, it is erotic ... after a while you've been really saturated ... [you become] impotent for a while and that is nothing unusual."<br><br><br><b>Ted Bundy</b><br><br>Ted Bundy was one of the most notorious serial killers ever in America. He killed at least 28 young women and girls. When he was finally convicted and before his execution he asked to see Dr James Dobson of "Focus on the Family". He wanted Dobson to make public his final reflections and the facts as he saw them. The facts were these. Bundy came from a good home. Aged 13 he saw some soft-core pornography by accident. Over a period of years he viewed more and more and he wanted more sexually graphic and violent materials until simply viewing wasn't enough. He began to wonder if actually doing some of the things he saw would give greater excitement. It was clear with Ted Bundy that each encounter with pornography lowered his inhibitions and made him desire even more, until fantasy did not satisfy. Before he died he said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>I've lived in prison for a long time now. And I've met a lot of men who were motivated to commit violence just like me. And without exception, everyone of them was deeply involved in pornography - without question, without exception - deeply influenced and consumed by an addiction to pornography. There's no question about it. The FBI's own study on serial homicide shows that the most common interest among serial killers is pornography.</div></blockquote>

<p>And then there is the harm not just to individuals but to the culture as a whole. As with the homosexualizing of the culture so with its ready acceptance of pornography, there follows a break up of the "social contract". Viewing people who seem happy to tolerate pornography and even enjoy it, an individual may well ask himself, says E.J.Mishan:</p>

<blockquote><div>are these the sort of people for whose society he must stand ready to make sacrifices? ... Can anyone care very much what happens to a society whose members are continually and visibly obsessed with sexual carousal - to a society where, in effect, the human animal has been reduced to a life-style that consists in the main activity of alternatively inflaming itself and relieving itself?</div></blockquote>

<p>The time has, surely, come not only to be angry but to take action. A cursory look at late night viewing now on mainstream TV channels, not least on Channel 5, suggests enough is enough. Pornography in the arts is like a cancer. It spreads. In the words of Irving Kristol: "Gresham's Law can work for books or theatre [and TV] as efficiently as it does for coinage - driving out the good, establishing the debased."<br><br>Nor should it be said that nothing can be done. It is true that with the proliferation of digital channels and the internet, the possibility for pornography is enormous. However, what is mainstream TV and publicly funded (or endorsed by licence) does determine standards and it does not have to follow what Kristol calls "the debased". A public stance on what is acceptable and unacceptable is of great significance in the wider world, as is clear parental disapproval in the world of the family. An American psychiatrist giving evidence in an important court case dealing with pornography and young people said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Psychiatrists ... make a distinction between the reading of pornography, as unlikely to be per se harmful, and the permitting of the reading of pornography, which is conceived as potentially harmful. The child is protected in his reading of pornography by the knowledge that it is pornographic, i.e. disapproved. To openly permit implies parental approval and even suggests seductive encouragement. If this is so of parental approval, it is equally so of societal approval - another potent influence on the developing ego.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The Christian Institute</b><br><br>We can be thankful to the Christian Institute for their action in taking on Newcastle City Council and Jack Frere with his Xsensual 2000 at the Newcastle Arena. The result according to Tyne Tees TV lunch time News on 12 September was that the "controversial adult entertainment exhibition has been a spectacular failure ... the adverse publicity [generated by the Christian Institute] kept the public away. Promoter Jack Frere says he has lost more that £200,000 pounds." That may deter him from attempting further promotions, for which we can thank God. But we need to pray for wisdom as to what more can be done. One thing we know can be done is to evangelize. That is the number one priority. Jesus said that out of the heart "come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly" (Mark 7.21-22). People need to be born again. Laws cannot change the heart. However they can restrain the heartless, to quote Martin Luther King. That is why we also need to develop a Christian consciousness about the public realm and political issues.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Church in Today's World">(November 2000) The Church in Today's World</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>November 2000</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Let me begin with three assumptions.<br><br>One, Christians need to meet together from time to time.<br><br>Two, when you meet, groups of 9, 90, 900 or 9000 are different entities in terms of functioning and possibilities: I am currently in a church with 900 different people in church on a Sunday. But I know well, and have been in, churches with many less than 90.<br><br>Three, God, not us, gives growth in the church. But he expects us to be obedient.<br><br><br><b>Numbers</b><br><br>So with those assumptions I want to give you some facts from the Christian Research Association. Their findings about the state of the churches in England were published in January 2000. In simple terms they showed that both the churches in England and (for those of us who are Anglican) the Church of England are in a dire situation.<br><br>Most of the mainline churches lost one fifth of their members or attenders during the 90's with the Church of England declining by 23 percent. Church House denied it: they said it had only declined by 17 percent! <br><br>There is a slow collapse going on of the churches in England and that is the context for our thinking this morning. In 1979 5.4 million were in all churches on a normal Sunday; by 1989 that had dropped to 4.7 million; while by 1998 it had fallen to 3.7 million. Most serious of all was what is happening to children and young people. At the beginning of the 20th century 56 out of 100 children were in Sunday school. Now it is 4 out of 100 children.<br><br>But I have been asked to focus on the question: "Superstore or corner shop?"<br><br>So what are the facts as they relate to individual churches and their size?<br><br>The average Sunday attendance of mainstream evangelical Anglicans is 90 (with the average for all Anglican churches being 60). <br><br>But what is the profile of all English churches in terms of size? Well, a third (36 percent) have more than 100 in their Sunday congregation, a further quarter (24 percent) have between 51 and 100, and two churches out of 5 (40 percent) have 50 or fewer.<br><br>So two-thirds of the churches are "cornershops" or smaller churches with under 100. Of the one third of remaining churches (36 percent), 29 percent are "middle-sized churches" with 100 - 400 attenders. 7 percent are larger churches with over 400. And of these 7 percent 3 out of 5 (60 percent) are Roman Catholic.<br><br>What does all that tell us. Peter Brierley of CRA says it tells us this (I quote):</p>

<blockquote><div>45 percent of Roman Catholic church attenders go to just 27 percent of its churches. 44 percent of Anglican and 41 percent of Free Church churchgoers attend just 11 percent of their churches. Putting this another way for the Protestant churches, half of those attending church go to just 15 percent of the churches … [And here Peter Brierley quotes someone else] This comes as a consequence of "a disproportionately large number of churchgoers born after World War II preferring the very large churches that can respond to their demands for quality, choices and specialized ministries … [and] the replacement of the neighbourhood church by the regional megachurch ... [There is also]the growing demand for a high level of competence in the professional staff.</div></blockquote>

<p>And it tells us that most of the churches in England are living in cloud cuckoo-land when they think of "ministry to a parish". A group of 60 people - the average size of an Anglican congregation - has to minister according to the Gallup Survey for ACUPA (the famous Archbishops Commission on Urban Priority Areas) to 10,500 people if it is in an average UPA and to over 8,000 if it is an average suburban parish – or the minimum of 3000 if you take Peter Brierley's figures.<br><br>One clergyman supplemented by a few volunteers cannot minister to such a number. It is as much as he can do to minister to the people that come his way (people in the Sunday congregation, wedding couples, funerals, baptisms and, sometimes, the local school). <br><br>There is no way such small groups can have anything other than a token relationship with those huge numbers outside the church. To talk today about 'ministering to the parish' in urban areas is meaningless (and nonsense). With a committed leadership, after ministering to one another, these small groups of Christians should be able to evangelise among some of their own friends and relatives. The clergyman may be able to make one or two other contacts outside the activities mentioned earlier. But that is all; and that will be quite enough. These are hard facts, and they need to be faced.<br><br>The problem simply is this: many, if not most, of the churches are not attracting sufficiently large numbers of people that can significantly affect their local communities. The parish system is not working. The small church system is not working in terms of 'ministering to the parish'. <br><br>The facts now have to be faced. Nor are these just problems for UPA's but also suburban ones, as the figures show. So what are the solutions? We must pray and we must plan. And two key strategies suggest themselves.<br><br><br><b>Larger Churches and Church Planting</b><br><br>First, we need to develop more larger churches in towns and cities. These are churches that can provide a wide range of programmes. They meet needs that cross neighbourhood boundaries; and they have multiple staff. And even when churches are unlikely to be very large we should work for more relatively large churches, that can sustain a small staff and have 200 - 300 regularly at worship. There seems to be a desire for this sort of church. It is indicated by the choices of worshippers. <br><br>If we take the Church of England, at present two thirds of all Anglican worshippers can be found in one third of the Anglican congregations on a given Sunday. Half can be found in 20 per cent of the congregations. A third to 40 per cent can be found in 10 per cent of these congregations <br><br>This tells us where Anglicans are to be found. The majority will be found in a smaller number of larger churches. So if our concern is with actual people rather than ecclesiastical units and ecclesiastical buildings, time, energy and money should be spent on developing larger churches. This is where manpower and money needs to be spent if our concern is with people and not the maintenance of institutions. <br><br>At the time of the 1989 Christian Research survey I analysed the situation in Newcastle - in the Anglican deanery of Newcastle Central. At that time one third of the clergy were serving half the attending membership (people who worshipped in larger churches). Two thirds served the other half (people that worshipped in smaller churches). It would seem that one third were having to put in more energy than the other two thirds. Such a pattern is inimical to growth. The larger churches are under-staffed; and the smaller churches are often over-staffed; as someone has put it, 'there is too much pastor for too few people'. <br><br>If this is so, these smaller churches will find it hard to finance their pastor. The result? Much of their energy will be diverted to 'fund raising' rather than mission. In the past there have been subsidies readily available from the centre - but no longer. <br><br>Of course, we must be careful before holding up very large churches as models for everyone. Certainly more of these are needed in urban areas. But most churches are not and will not be like these. This leads to the second strategy - church planting. This also is where time, energy and money should be spent.<br><br>Many are now seeing that as important in terms of getting the gospel out. And in terms of Church Growth we know church planting works, on average. That is to say, it is easier to give birth than to raise the dead! New churches do grow quickly. But - and this is a big but - they grow quickly to become viable small churches. Then many simply replicate the small church syndrome. By itself church planting will not be a long term solution to the re-evangelisation of our nation unless there is a vision of new small churches growing large.<br><br>And we do need larger churches. You can there have teams of full-time workers functioning together. They have economies of scale, usually a thriving music ministry and a strong youth work (children tend to prefer larger groups where they can find friends), more social effectiveness, more media involvement and (contrary to some suggestions) a healthy effect on smaller churches.<br><br>If you take the typology of the sociologist Ernst Troeltsch the larger churches are "church"-type churches as distinct from "sect"-type churches. That has nothing to do with sects like JW's (I hasten to add) but with the ways in which churches relate to the wider culture. It is simply that larger churches have greater social strength in terms of their local community. And evangelistically it is easier for visitors to attend a larger church than a smaller one. If they are seekers, they are often self-conscious. You can't slip into a little chapel of 35 people unnoticed. You can slip into a larger church. Of course, they need to be welcomed - but only to the level they want.<br><br>But you say, "It is all very well for you. You are in a larger church. What if you were in a smaller church?"<br><br><br><b>Small Churches Growing</b><br><br>How can a small church grow? Five preliminary comments need to be made. <br><br>First, we need to answer those who think that this sort of statistical analysis is improper in discussing the Church. They acknowledge that the Church is a theological reality; they acknowledge that it is a historical reality; but they are not so sure about the suggestion that it is a sociological reality. Well, grace perfects and does not destroy nature. The Church consists of redeemed men and women, but they are still human men and women both in their individual and communal lives. So principles of normal human interaction will usually be as true of the Church's life as they are of society in general. The distinguishing marks of the Church's communal life should be interaction by love and the fruit of the Spirit! Hooker once said the church is a society as well as a society supernatural.<br><br>Second, 'small is beautiful'. After all the 'small church' is one of the oldest forms of the local church. The early Church met in homes - (true, sometimes large homes); but many must have been 'small churches'. <br><br>Third, small churches can grow. It is often assumed that all small churches must remain small. This was not the experience of the small churches in the early centuries. Of course, some churches in areas of low or de - population may have permanently limiting factors. But for many small churches, under God, given adequate faith, obedience, self-understanding and strategy, there is no reason why they shouldn't grow.<br><br>The trouble with many small churches is this: those that have reached a ceiling and been small for some time, often have a low level of corporate self-esteem. As Lyle Schaller puts it:</p>

<blockquote><div>Frequently the members of these congregations see themselves as small, weak, unattractive, powerless, and frustrated with a limited future. That self-image often creates a self-perpetuating cycle that produces policies and decisions that inhibit the potential outreach. Their priorities are survival and institutional maintenance, not evangelism.</div></blockquote>

<p>Fourth, the reason why some small churches do not grow may be 'spiritual', but not necessarily. They may be biblically illiterate and spiritually dead. Schaller (again) makes this cautionary comment: <br><br>'After interviewing lay persons from over five thousand congregations including hundreds of leaders from small churches, I have found no evidence to suggest that the commitment to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour is any less among the members of the small-membership churches than it is among the members of rapidly growing churches.'<br><br>Fifth, we must not view a small church as just a church with a small number of people in it. A small church is distinguished from a middle sized church not so much by its numerical size, but by its social structure. A small church is fundamentally a 'single cell' church. Let George Hunter explain. <br><br>'A church that is essentially a single cell, in which virtually all the members regularly interact with almost all the others is rightly designated a "small" church. Multicell churches, where a given member interacts with some members all the time, but with others only occasionally or rarely, are not by this definition small churches.'<br><br>It is true that a number of 'small' churches 'stretch' their 'single cells' to a size larger than you would expect; but they are still large single cells.<br><br>So how do small churches grow? Answer: with difficulty. The 'holding' power of the small church is very great indeed. It meets some basic human needs including that for 'order' in life. This is because a small church is so often always the same. That is attractive and reassuring.<br><br>As the typical small church is an overgrown small group, it has certain priorities. It is these that make growth difficult. The members want a small group experience of face-to-face contact. They are not so much interested in 'goals', or a well managed structure, or 'programmes appropriate to modern urban needs'. They put a high price on the quality of interpersonal relationships. They will, therefore, resist anything that looks like eroding the strength of these relationships.<br><br>That is the reason why you cannot, in terms of Church planning, put a number of existing 'small churches' together and make them into a 'larger one'. It cannot be done just like that. And that is the reason why growth s hard. For the small church to grow, there has to be a trade off. Carl Dudley sums it up: 'A small church cannot grow in membership size without giving up its most precious appeal, its intimacy.' Its 'intimacy' is the basic satisfaction that everyone knows (or knows about) everyone else.<br><br>But let us assume that a small church has begun to face this issue 'head-on' and they are willing to consider evangelism as more important than cosy relationships, what then? How can it start to grow? <br><br>Of course, it is vital that the church is dependent on the Holy Spirit to guide and equip. Of course, prayer must be the context of every strategy. But there are four other strategies that can be employed in the case of small churches that want to begin to grow.<br><br><br><b>Four Strategies</b><br><br>Strategy number one is to encourage the membership to focus on Christ's 'Great Commission' (Matthew 28.19) that we should 'go and make disciples of all nations.' This is all inclusive and covers all those outside the Church. Few in a small church would really be motivated for growth who did not believe in the 'lostness of the lost'!<br><br>Strategy number two is to multiply cells. That will require a preliminary educational exercise. <br><br>The members of a small 'single cell' congregation need to realise that a multiple cell church can be healthy, whereas remaining a single cell church is unhealthy. It imposes limits on outreach! Being so 'tightly knit', it is much harder for outsiders to 'break into' a single cell church. <br><br>Nor, as we have already suggested, can a small church always minister adequately in a complex society and it usually will be very weak in regard to youth work. <br><br>And most important of all, the members of a small church need to realise that the values they so cherish in the small church can be experienced in the larger congregation. True, it won't happen automatically. There has to be conscious planning on the part of the leadership in a large church to ensure the maintenance of small units within the growing church. These can still 'hold' people. But experience proves that in a multicell congregation, each person can still be related to as many people as in a single-cell congregation. Meaningful fellowship can be maintained; and generally the long-standing members will continue to relate to each other.<br><br>Perhaps the easiest way of 'going multicell' is the creation of 'new groups' in the church. One or two members may start a Bible discussion group for outreach; or, as we have at Jesmond 'Food for Thought' groups - 'beginners Groups' over a meal. These are for people who either are uncommitted and are wanting to ask questions; or for people just become Christian and who want to sort out further some issues of belief; or for people who are already committed but want to go back to basics.<br><br>And there are other forms of new 'cell life'. Where there is a will, there is usually a way. Ken Moulder at Walkergate in Newcastle took on a very small dead church. He developed a new cell by planting a new congregation. The first service was the small cell of the old guard. The 11.00 am service was the new cell and is now the main service of what is no longer a small church but a middle-sized church with a small staff team. But it takes time, effort and training. <br><br>If your key leaders who could start 'cells' are always off to deanery or diocesan meetings or denominational meetings, you have a problem! In a small church it is usually just those people who have to go to such meetings - there is no one else to go. It is then a matter of priorities. <br><br>One of the difficulties a small church faces over growing is that the initiative to help often won't come from inside. In an urban area a number of the members of a small Church quite possibly will say, 'If I wanted our church to be a big one, I would be going somewhere else'. <br><br>Often the only hope is when the Vicar or Pastor has a turn around and a radically new awareness of the possibilities of growth. He becomes aware that Christ calls us not just to 'feed sheep' but to 'catch fish'. He sees that being a vicar and exercising leadership for growth is a very sophisticated and exciting task. He becomes enthusiastic about his small church growing. He realises that while principles may apply across the board, no two churches are alike. He has no intention of 'aping' the big church in the middle of town. But he sees the potential for change in his small church. Quite realistically he is not expecting it all to be different in the morning! But he begins to recognise the truth of the proposition that 'most clergy over estimate what they can achieve in one year and underestimate what they can achieve in five years.' <br><br>With such a 'renewed' vicar or pastor the small church has leadership for change. Otherwise it may have to wait for a change of incumbent. That is why strategy number three for small church growth is for there to be a new (or renewed) vicar or pastor. <br><br>Strategy number four for small church growth is to function 'properly' and to enable 'bridges' to be built. Let me explain.<br><br><br><b>Evangelism</b><br><br>Many small church people are not by nature 'evangelistic'. They are warm hearted and good at hospitality; but aggressive evangelism is not always their gift. It is not that they do not want to see men and women won to Jesus Christ. But they 'shiver' at the thought of becoming evangelistic. <br><br>'They balk', writes Hunter, 'because they equate evangelism with visiting strangers on their turf, verbalizing the Gospel and eliciting a response in one transaction, and then assimilating these responding strangers into their single-cell church.'<br><br>But one of the lessons that those studying church growth have discovered in recent years is that outreach to strangers is not the normal way for people to be converted and assimilated into the Church. <br><br>Indeed, what is being seen is a more biblical pattern of evangelism. Evangelism (or growth) is seen as a function not just of the individual but of the whole Church. As St Paul says:</p>

<blockquote><div>speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love' (RSV Eph. 4.15-16).</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>That has been my experience over the years. The quality of the care in the crèche, the condition of the toilets, the friendliness of sidesmen, the attractiveness of the flowers, the liveliness of the music, the effort put in by the vicar or pastor and other staff in preparing business meetings as well as the essential duties of the church in front line evangelism, preaching, teaching, pastoral care and appropriate social and political involvement, are all integral to the growth of the Church. And, of course, there needs to be a 'climate of love', prayer and expectancy for the Holy Spirit to work.<br><br>The goal, of course, is not to 'get decisions', but 'to make disciples'. Men and women have to be built up and helped to function in the local church, the body of Christ. Evangelism is, therefore, a 'total' process. But there should be many points of entry into the Christian fellowship and for commitment to Jesus Christ. <br><br>Growth obviously needs those with the gift of evangelism being freed to function. And perhaps more have that gift than realise it: the first qualification, many would say, is not the ability to speak but the ability to listen. You can then apply the gospel to 'real' needs. <br><br>Growth also needs 'new converts' being encouraged to evangelise. It is the experience of many that in the early phase of a new convert's life, communication 'bridges' with those 'outside' are still strong. In time, however, these old links weaken. But in a church where there is a continuous programme of evangelism, new converts are always replacing the old.<br><br>But does all this mean that the established members of the congregation, who do not feel 'called' to 'evangelise', are consigned to making the tea? No!<br><br>This is because more people are inside the 'orbit' of the Church than we imagine. For we are all in relationship with a number of people. Our Church decline is often due to our failure to use the 'bridges' that are quite open to each one of us. Indeed, it would be most unusual if there were not responsive people in our own existing networks of social relationships: they will be relatives, friends, neighbours and colleagues at work.<br><br>Research has shown that most new Church members come through personal invitation. A Gallup Poll of churchgoers showed that 58 per cent of those who now go to Church regularly, first began going when they were invited by someone they knew. Conversely, 63 per cent of those who do not go to Church say that none of their friends or acquaintances has ever invited them.<br><br>Winfield Arn conducted a survey of 4,000 converts. He wanted to find out how they got into contact with the Church. His findings were these: three quarters of these new Christians were invited to Church by relatives and friends; about one in ten were attracted by the clergyman; fewer just walked in; about 3 per cent came through the churches' programmes or because of a special need or through a Bible study group by itself. Less than two per cent came through being visited by Church members.<br><br>Of course, programmes, meeting needs and all the rest of the Church's life is vital once a person is in relationship with a church. But the initial invitation is so fundamental.<br><br>There is a Mennonite church in Japan. This has been for many years the fastest-growing congregation of its denomination in that country. It has one principle of church growth - 'postconversion training'.<br><br>One evening every week for three months a new convert receives this training. It is done on a one to one basis in the new converts home. The convert's family is invited to join in if they wish (this is all part of the 'social network' strategy). For a few minutes each evening the trainer and convert list names of relatives, friends, neighbours and colleagues at work. At the end of three months every contact of the new convert should have been identified. Those not in any church are then marked and the trainer asks: 'Which of these do you have influence with?' These are then made into a final list and are visited by both the convert and the trainer. The convert simply says what has been happening in his life and the trainer tries to explain something of the gospel. He then leaves a Bible portion or a booklet. The person is invited to Church or some special event. If interest is shown there is a further visit. The goal is for that person to come to a living faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br><br><b>Leadership</b><br><br>Now, essential for all this - in a larger or smaller church - is leadership for growth. Excluding non-biblical theologies and an absence of prayer, humanly speaking the number one reason why we are not seeing churches grow in the UK is that we are lacking leaders. At present there are too few people who can lead churches to growth and to become larger churches. Because of general church decline in Britain together with the parochial system and current expectations developed during ministerial training, too few people are placed in, or socialized for, leadership of larger churches. Leaders of such churches need to be visionary and entrepreneurial. Yet present clergy selection and training systems, certainly in the Church of England, seem calculated to fail. At best they seem structured to produce shepherds of sheep rather than fishers of men.<br><br>In organizational terms any body of people (secular or religious), to succeed, needs four things going for it. And may I say here, of course, God can do anything in his sovereignty. He works miracles from time to time. But we shouldn't plan on miracles but on God's regularities. And those four things are: an agreed agenda; competent leadership; enabling structures; and client sensitivity. If you fail on any one of those, humanly speaking, you are in for trouble.<br><br>Now the church in general in this country has not got an agreed agenda. For the church that agreed agenda has to include agreement on fundamental theological issues. Praise God, that evangelicals are getting back to such an agreed agenda. For that we have to thank especially the Proclamation Trust, and, not the least, our friends from Australia in terms of biblical literacy and the Christian Institute in terms of key social issues. But I am afraid I hear some evangelicals think that all you need is then to get biblical preachers in the pulpits of our land and then encourage the congregation to write letters in support of Baroness Young and "bingo". Now all that is absolutely necessary.<br><br>But where does the bible ever suggest that being a good teacher means automatically you will be a good leader. Yes, in the church the leader has to be biblically literate and has to have teaching gifts. Leadership is by and under the word. Yes, I read in 2 Timothy that there have to be those who are "qualified to teach others". But being "qualified to teach" according to 1 Timothy 3 is only one qualification for being an elder or leader in the church. There are a string of other qualifications. Being a bible teacher doesn't necessarily mean you are going to be a leader.<br><br>But I hear people saying, "I must go to this or that theological college because it will make me a good bible teacher." Great. That is necessary if you want to lead but not sufficient. That is only one facet of leadership in the church. <br><br>We interview for jobs at JPC. We now have 20 on the staff and there are ten with teaching roles. For those we look for people with teaching gifts but also with the qualities listed in 1 Tim 3 and also with that spirit of "power, of love and of self-discipline" mentioned in 2 Timothy 1. We want people at Jesmond, and only such people, who can, yes, feed the sheep, but also fight the wolf. We don't want any "hired hands" who can feed the sheep, but when the going gets tough, slink away.<br><br>So Christian churches need agreed agendas (sound biblical theology); but they also need competent leaders (and that means today, leaders who can fight the wolf). George Barna sums it up like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>The vast majority of those who go into full-time ministry do so because they feel they have a gift for teaching. Unfortunately, the dreams of these young ministers are dashed once they [leave theological college]; they soon discover that pastors must fill leadership roles for which they were not trained, and which they often do not feel capable of handling.</div></blockquote>

<p>And then they become ridiculous caricatures of leadership. Some become the drill sergeant type who loves to be in control and who rules through fear, guilt, pressure and position rather than service and faithfulness to God's word and his people. As someone has well said, "giving orders does not make a person a leader any more than flying in an aeroplane makes a person a bird." And there are vicars in the C of E like this.<br><br>Or they become the robot type - these carry out tasks by rote, stifle creativity and set survival as the standard of success. Conflicts are covered up and new ideas are shelved. But the Christian leader leads by faith. Sometime risks have to be taken but with the intelligence to evaluate the risks and faith in God for the outcome. Some archdeacons in the C of E are this sort of "robotic" leader.<br><br>Or there is the monarch type - and a number of C of E bishops are of this type. These are the sort of leaders who, as it has also well been put, "have been elevated to a position of leadership as a career reward for having played by the rules, not as a ministry calling. These individuals assume that others will follow by virtue of [their] status and reputation regardless of [their] abilities."<br><br>And you can be a mainstream evangelical, a good bible teacher, but your leadership can be of these sorts.<br><br>But leaders who can lead to growth are the sort of people who are able to discover God's vision for the church (their particular church or group); to motivate people to get involved; to lead the way in amassing resources to complete the required tasks; to mobilize teams of leaders and gifted specialists; to help them think creatively about innovative solutions; to push them without over-pushing them; and to encourage them to live by faith with all that that means.<br><br><br><b>Structures</b><br><br>But after an agreed agenda and competent leadership, you then need enabling structures. And here we have a major problem. Certainly the structures we have inherited in the mainline denominations are disabling for the most part - nor is that an exaggeration. I have written about that elsewhere in my book Church and State in the New Millennium - it is coming out in paperback on Dec 4. I haven't time to go into that now.<br><br>But let me make this point. If you go back to the survey figures of Peter Brierley, in terms of church structure or denomination the only structural growth (or denominational growth) is that of the Orthodox and the New [or House] Churches. The Orthodox can be discounted in some measure as they have such a small base. They grew from 12,300 to 25,200 over 10 years. But the New Churches who are now twice the size of the URCs, bigger than denominational Pentecostals, nearly as big as the Baptists and soon will be as big as the Methodists - they grew from 167,000 to 230,500 - an increase of 38 percent in 10 years.<br><br>What does that have to tell us about structures and denominations? It tells us that we ought to be looking at these groups to see what they are doing right.<br><br>There is often an openness to the gospel, but Christians are not getting the gospel out. The institutions that we have inherited - the old denominations are not responsive enough to the changing world. Nor is a change in the message needed - of course, not! But we need a radical change in our structures, both locally and in terms of the wider church. And some of the New Churches have lessons for us, especially the ones in America – the so called "New Apostolic Churches". For a start, our denominational (and independent Free Church) structures are geared too often to the over 55s who are quite different from the generations below. For example, the over 55s still have "brand loyalties" - they will still shop only at M&amp;S and keep to the same bank as they had as students. The younger generations - to use the phrases - the baby boom and the busters generations - have no such loyalties. They have no such loyalties, either, to denominations. This, of course, relates to my fourth essential for organizations - client sensitivity. The culture all around us is changing so fast that we simply cannot re-create the past. We have to be sensitive to our clients.<br><br>However, for my part I do not, structurally, want to loose all the good things from the past. I am committed to the Western Reformed Catholic tradition - that is the tradition of the bible as I understand it, the best of Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Cranmer, the leaders of the Evangelical Revival, Spurgeon, and Ryle. I am not willing to loose that gospel - the gospel those folk preached. But in structural terms I know something new is needed.<br><br>What do we do while we are thinking about these things? Answer:</p>

<blockquote><div>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction. 3 For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry' (2 Tim 4:2-5 NIV).</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="John Charles Ryle 1816-1900">(December 2000) John Charles Ryle 1816-1900</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2000</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>The year 2000 sees the centenary of the death of John Charles Ryle. In terms of the kingdom of God Ryle was one of the most significant men of the second half of the 19th century. 100 years after his death people are again turning to his writings to learn (or re-learn) the fundamental truths of biblical Christianity - the truths that the Church of England was founded upon and for which some of the founding fathers were martyred. Many of us have personally benefited from reading Ryle's works. <br><br>He died or (to use the words of the title of one of his famous tracts) he went "home at last", aged 85, on 10 June 1900. He was then buried beside his (third) wife (all three had pre-deceased him) at All Saints', Childwall, on the slope of a hill looking south across the Mersey into Cheshire. Childwall, at the time a rural parish, was where Ryle used to go to be quiet and have time off from the pressures of his busy life as the first Bishop of Liverpool. Liz Holgate, prior to coming onto our staff at Jesmond Parish Church, was a member of All Saints', Childwall and tells of an elderly member of the congregation who could reminisce about J.C.Ryle - her sister had worked for the bishop.<br><br><br><b>His Greatness</b><br><br>The Sunday following his death Richard Hobson, a close friend, a clergymen in his diocese and at whose church Ryle and his wife used to worship when free, was preaching at the "provisional" cathedral. Hobson spoke of Ryle's greatness:</p>

<blockquote><div>[he] was great through the abounding grace of God. He was great in stature; great in mental power; great in spirituality; great as a preacher and expositor of God's most holy Word; great in hospitality; great in winning souls to God; great as a writer of Gospel tracts; great as an author of works which will long live, great as a bishop of the Reformed Evangelical Protestant Church of England of which he was a noble defender, great as the first Bishop of Liverpool. I am bold to say that perhaps few men in the nineteenth century did so much for God, for truth, for righteousness, among the English speaking race and in the world as our late bishop.</div></blockquote>

<p>100 years later many believe that was a fair assessment. But what makes a "great man"? J.I.Packer says you need at least achievement and "universality". <br><br>In Ryle's case there was the achievement of establishing a brand new diocese (Liverpool had just been split off from Chester when Ryle went there). There was the achievement of his national evangelical leadership. Before going to Liverpool Ryle was a country parson in Suffolk ending up at Stradbroke Parish Church, where he went the year Jesmond Parish Church was founded (1861). While there he was considered the leader of the evangelicals in the Church of England. He lead through his preaching and teaching, travelling considerably. He also lead through his other great achievement - his writing. He was a brilliant writer. Unlike many Victorians (and particularly religious writers) he is still readable today. The style is uniquely his own and from a different day to ours. But what he says is crystal clear. <br><br>Then in addition to his achievement Ryle was great because of this quality of "universality". Packer says:</p>

<blockquote><div>Great men impress us as men not simply raised up for their own day, but as men who are there, raised up by God as we Christians would say, for the benefit and the blessing of generations other than their own.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Early years</b><br><br>Yes, Ryle was a Victorian. And the Victorians have often had a bad press - sometimes rightly and sometimes wrongly. There was the class system and the social structure which we find offensive today. Only rarely are you conscious of Ryle's "Victorianism". But that world and that culture were hugely significant for Ryle. The existence of social class was the context for one of the defining moments in Ryle's own life.<br><br>Ryle had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was educated at Eton and after Eton at Oxford University, where he excelled both academically and in terms of sport. He was a distinguished classicist; captained Oxford at cricket (in one university match taking 10 wickets); and also rowed in the university boat race. He then went back home to his family's estate in Macclesfield which, as the eldest son, he expected to inherit having made his way in law and politics. But then something happened. His father's bank crashed. His father became bankrupt losing everything overnight. Here are Ryle's own words:<br><br>My father was a wealthy man. He was a landed proprietor and a banker. I was the eldest son and looked forward to inheriting a large fortune. I was on the point of entering Parliament. I had all things before me until I was twenty-five. But it then pleased God to alter my prospects in life through my father's bankruptcy. We got up one summer's morning with all the world before us as usual and went to bed that evening completely and entirely ruined.<br><br>This had a profound effect on Ryle. Writing twenty five years later he wrote ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... with all the world before me [I] lost everything and saw the whole future of my life, turned upside down and thrown into confusion. If I hadn't been a Christian at that time, I do not know if I should not have committed suicide. As it was, everybody said how beautifully I behaved, how resigned I was, what an example of contentment I was. Never was there more a complete mistake. God alone knows how the iron entered into my soul; how my whole frame - body, mind and spirit - reeled and was shaken to the foundation under the blow of my father's ruin. I am quite certain it inflicted a wound on my body and mind, of which I feel the effects most heavily at this day and shall feel it if I live to be a hundred. To suppose that people do not feel things because they do not scream and yell and fill the air with their cries is simple nonsense.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The Turning point</b><br><br>But a more important turning point had occurred before that moment. It was in his last months at Oxford. He had been made to think about God and eternity during a period of illness. After he recovered he found himself in a church one Sunday - arriving late! He was just in time for the second bible reading from Paul's letter to the Ephesians. And the lesson reader, we are told, read clearly and distinctly with a pause between each phrase. This may seem artificial to us, but it had a profound effect on Ryle. The words "for by grace ... are ye saved ... through faith ... and that ... not of yourselves ... it is the gift of God" worked in Ryle's life. They went from his head to his heart. He now understood what the gospel of grace and salvation through faith in Christ alone really meant.<br><br>Ryle was a clear writer because he was a clear thinker. He knew his own mind. And for most of his life he saw the need to help others come to those same convictions. He never claimed they were his own convictions. Rather they were his convictions about the central core of the biblical message. These were his evangelical convictions. He summed them up under five headings: first, the absolute supremacy of the bible as the only rule of faith and practice; secondly, the fact and reality of human sin, such that we are all under God's judgment [not just people in the tabloids]; thirdly, the centrality of the work of Christ dying for sin on the cross, rising again and, ascended, praying now for us - and with the need for us to have childlike faith; fourthly, the need for the work of the Holy Spirit to bring new life to the believer and for the believer to be conscious of that work; and fifthly, the need, if God is at work in a person's life, for changes in "conduct, behaviour, tastes, ways, choices, and habits."<br><br>Ryle was at heart an evangelist. Throughout his life he preached, wrote and taught so that men and women would come to faith in Christ. But he was also concerned for changes in the church. He saw the church of his day loosing grip of the fundamentals as clearly set out in the Thirty-nine Articles and the theology of the 1662 Prayer Book. He wrote about the Pharisaical tendency of adding to the bible. He saw the Roman Catholic church doing that by adding all sorts of human traditions as necessary to salvation. He also wrote about the Sadducean tendency of wanting to subtract from that biblical tradition. This was being done by, what today we would call, "liberal" theologians.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Undoubtedly Ryle made mistakes. One of his tracts is entitled "The Fallibility of Ministers". He points out that the bible alone is infallible. "Even the Apostles themselves, when not writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, were at times liable to err." A great supporter of the Reformers, Ryle said that at times Luther, Calvin and Cranmer got things wrong. To remember this is not to reject most of their teaching. It is to test everything by the Bible. Ryle's biographies of the Reformers and the Puritans are still worth reading. My favourite of all Ryle's books is Christian Leaders of the 18th Century. If you have not read it, why not get it for Christmas? This will give you not only an insight into the lives of men like Whitefield and Wesley, but also a good indirect introduction, without tears, into Ryle's and, surely, biblical evangelical theology.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Religion, Education, City Academies and Newcastle upon Tyne">(January 2001) Religion, Education, City Academies and Newcastle upon Tyne</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Sunday Programme</b><br><br>On 17 December the BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme in the run-up to Christmas 2000 featured religious education. A concerned parent was being interviewed. She was an educated woman - an author and writer on the Financial Times and an agnostic, not a believing Christian; and she expressed worries that there is discrimination in our schools against Christianity. She said:</p>

<blockquote><div>My daughter has been in a state primary school for four years and in that time she has never been part of a religious assembly. She's never been involved in a nativity play. She's never learnt a hymn. And she's never sung a Christmas Carol. I'm shocked at how little my children know about Christmas, about Easter, about anything that is part of the Christian tradition. And I believe that is a vital part of the cultural inheritance of our country.</div></blockquote>

<p>No wonder a recent survey conducted by an advertising agency revealed that only 8 percent of children now associate Christmas with religion. "This woman," said the BBC, "levels part of the blame for this on our schools. She thinks that while it makes obvious sense to educate children about other religions, the teaching profession should never loose sight of the significance of Christianity to Britain":</p>

<blockquote><div>I think we are in danger of rearing a generation with no spiritual values. And I think that would be a great shame. I think for my children Christmas is in danger (unless I personally do something about it rather than any school) of being simply about presents and Father Christmas and about going to Woollies.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Misrepresentation</b><br><br>It is important that parents get the facts out. There is a crisis in education. Our children in both state and in some of the independent schools are being indoctrinated in values that are anti-Christian. Fundamentally, the evolution of these educational policies is based on a misrepresentation - namely that we are a "multi-faith" society. We are not. Christian parents need to insist on this with head teachers, youth leaders and Local Education Authorities (LEA's). In 1988 the Education Reform Act insisted that there must be "mainly Christian" religious education and "broadly and mainly Christian" acts of daily worship in our state schools. But the law is often being flouted on the basis that we are now a "multi-faith" society. But where is the misrepresentation? <br><br>In December 2000 the British Social Attitudes 17th Report was published by the National Centre for Social Research. Statistically rigorous and, therefore, generally reliable, it summarized the findings on religion in a chapter headed "Losing faith: is Britain alone?" On page 300 the questionnaire and detailed results were reproduced. According to the findings from the questionnaire, in Britain 51.9 percent of the population claim to be Christian; 3.1 percent claim to be Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist or an adherent of an "other non-Christian" faith; and 43.8 percent claim they have "no religion" (1.2 percent are refusals or don't knows).<br><br><br><b>"Multi-faithism"</b><br><br>In simple terms over half of British citizens say they are Christian. 44 percent say they are nothing (like the concerned parent the BBC featured). But only a mere 3 percent say they are of another faith (Muslims are 1.5 percent of these).<br><br>Of course, people of other faiths and none have rights as citizens of the United Kingdom; and, of course, they must have their freedoms within the law. But it is, surely, not right that members of the educational establishment (civil servants and local officials) should hold our children to spiritual ransom on the grounds that to teach them the facts of the Christian faith would be discriminating against children from other religious backgrounds; and so policies of "multi-faithism" should be introduced. To insist on "multi-faith" schooling is corrosive especially of Christianity but also of other beliefs and world views. It gives not a neutral philosophy but a positive philosophy that suggests that in principle all claims to truth are to be ignored in the interests of toleration. This, however, breeds not "toleration" but indifferentism and a disregard for questions of truth. <br><br>Under this philosophy, religion is not taught in terms of possible truth or error, but usually as an interesting set of myths and symbols. To teach the historic Christian faith in this way is to undermine it and to distort it. Christianity is a historic religion if it is anything! Either Christ died (as Muslims deny) or he didn't; he either rose from the grave (in a real resurrection leaving an empty tomb) or he didn't. The truth of those facts is absolutely central. To establish these truth claims is to go a long way to establishing the Christian faith. To ignore these truth claims as truth claims - the policy of many religious educationalists - is to change Christianity into Gnosticism - a sect that flourished in New Testament and post-New Testament times and against which the apostle John wrote and argued. It is to indoctrinate our children into heresy.<br><br><br><b>City Academies</b><br><br>So what are the options? We must all try to "blow the whistle" as and when we can - politely but firmly in the manner of the Financial Times' journalist. By default, many educationalists give in to unrepresentative parents and minorities on the basis of no information whatsoever about the real size of the other faith communities.<br><br>In addition, we need more overtly Christian schools - not just for religious education but also for sexual ethics, about which many parents are increasingly worried. We, therefore, need to explore, particularly in Newcastle, setting-up City Academies. The government has announced the possibility of creating City Academies in areas in need of urban regeneration. These would be non-fee paying, but independent schools, financed by the government. At least six are in the pipeline in areas such as Liverpool, Middlesborough and some of the London boroughs. More announcements are expected soon. The possibility is that some of them could have a Christian basis. They would be similar to existing City Technology Colleges. There are fifteen of these and the nearest of them to us is Emmanuel College in Gateshead. Emmanuel has a clear Christian basis. It has excellent examination results and its students are recognised as being confident, well adjusted, highly personable and well equipped for work and citizenship. The initial set-up cost for City Academies will be shared by sponsors and government. They will cost the local authorities nothing in terms of set-up; and the running cost, year by year, will be met by central government. The City Academies would be independent but would be expected to be a partner in the family of local schools, both to share with others their own good practice and to be prepared also to learn from the good practice of others.<br><br><br><b>A City Academy for Newcastle</b><br><br>Peter Vardy, a committed Christian business man, based in Sunderland, is a nationally renowned car retailer. He was the main sponsor in the creation of Emmanuel College back in 1990. He has told the government that he is prepared to sponsor six more of these academies provided they have an ethos similar to Emmanuel College. He would like them to be in the North East of England. <br><br>Newcastle is apparently very keen to regenerate the West End of the city to attract businesses. High quality schooling is essential to both these goals. So far the Newcastle education authority, which is responsible for some of the worst secondary schooling in the country, has turned down the idea of a City Academy. It would seem that the LEA is not prepared to put the interests of children (or the wishes of parents) first. But on Peter Vardy's part the door is not closed. The offer remains on the table. The possibility remains, therefore, for a quality school in the riverside area of the west of the City devoted to high standards of behaviour and educational attainment but also providing a sound basis in Christian belief and ethics. There is a continuing drift of much state education from its Christian moorings. Has not the time come for Christians to speak out and seek to persuade the City Council of their need to look at the matter again and with some urgency and to put children, not ideology, first?<br><br>A school for the Blakelaw and West Denton areas is being proposed. Hopefully it would be some improvement on the existing situation. It would involve a partnership between the LEA, Newcastle University and the (official) Church of England. But this is unlikely to deliver the sort of education really needed, however good the intention. Not least this is because it would be a Voluntary Controlled (rather than Voluntary Aided) school. This means the church's voice would be in the minority and could be theologically very liberal.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Surely the City, like Gateshead, needs a school that is unashamedly, but sanely, Christian; committed to excellence; open to every background (providing parents accept the philosophy of the school); and giving hope to many children who otherwise would have little hope. Such a school, a Christian City Academy, can and must be established in the West End of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Christian and Money">(February 2001) The Christian and Money</h2><ul><li>February 2001</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>(This article by the former principal of Moore College, Sydney, has been abbreviated by David Holloway and is published with permission of The Briefing)</i><br><br><br><b>The Bible</b><br><br>Money figures largely in our thoughts. We occupy a lot of time thinking about it, about how much we have got, how much we need, how much we earn, how much we spend. The New Testament also has a lot to say about money, and what it says is quite remarkable because it is the opposite to what we normally think about money.<br><br>Before we examine what it says we need to ask ourselves whether we are willing to accept God's thoughts on the subject of money when these are clearly announced in the pages of the Bible and particularly taught by Jesus himself. Does God the Creator know more about the management of money than we do, and are we willing to accept his words as the rule for our conduct in this subject to which we give so much of our attention? Christian obedience means complete obedience and not only in those things where we happen to agree with God. Christian faith means trusting God even when our own views seem to suggest the contrary.<br><br>The first thing to note in the Bible teaching about money is that affluence is unimportant. Jesus taught this very clearly when he said, "A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions" (Lk 12:15). From this it follows that the first virtue to be cultivated with regard to the handling of money is the virtue of contentment. Thus, Paul teaches clearly that having food and clothing, with these we should be content (1 Tim 6:8). His remarks are in the context of his condemnation of Christians who think that the Christian life, and particularly the Christian ministry, is a way of making money and becoming rich. Godliness with contentment - that is the apostle's recipe for living, and what wonderful peace it brings, complete release from the rat-race. We are to live within our circumstances, for our circumstances are God-given. God is sovereign. The silver and gold are his. He is able to multiply money if we need it as easily as he multiplied the loaves and fishes on the hillside in Galilee, or as he multiplies the grain by turning it into the ear of corn through his rain and his sunshine and the fertile soil of his creation. If we look after God's affairs, he will look after us.<br><br>The second point about money that the Bible underlines is an obvious one, namely that affluence is unreliable. We can lose it quickly, and we all lose it at all events at death or in old age when it is no use to us (as we are too weak to do anything with it). Jesus, therefore, warned his disciples not to be rich in this world but rather to be rich in the next, rich towards God. He told the story of the rich farmer whose fields had produced abundant harvests. Instead of thanking God he simply said, "What will I do? I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, 'Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry'." But God said to him, "Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?" And Jesus added, "So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God" (Lk 12:18-21).<br><br>Money tempts us very strongly to put our trust in it, but it is a very uncertain thing, and after all is completely under God's control. Thus, the apostle tells Timothy, "As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God who richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy" (1 Tim 6:17). They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal and generous, thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed.<br><br>Affluence is unreliable. It is a snare to rely on money for the future. Our trust must be in God, who is in charge of our future and who will supply our needs, because he cares for us.<br><br><br><b>Sharing, greed and fear</b><br><br>In considering the Christian use of money it is important to realise that we must act responsibly in the use of the money under our control. The first principle that we may mention is that we must be willing to share our money with those in real need whom God's providence brings within the orbit of our life. It is not as though we have to go without in order that others might have affluence, but rather that we might share our blessings with those who have need of our help.<br><br>There are two great obstacles to sharing. The first is greed. We want more and more for ourselves. Greed is self-centred, and can only be cured by God. We must call upon him in prayer to give us his Holy Spirit so that our attitudes to life may agree with his character. God himself is a giving God. He gives us everything to enjoy fully. He has given us his Son to be our saviour. When we love God we will be able to love our brother, so we will rise above the greedy and selfish use of our money. Greediness grows if encouraged. We may be surprised how greedy we have become without noticing it. Of course, gambling is essentially greed, and an individual or a community that indulges in gambling (and it doesn't matter how small the sum) will become more and more greedy, and therefore less and less inclined to help one another in times of need. It is sad that the Government is encouraging this vice of greed in order to obtain revenue. Moreover, the greedy person is not a happy person. He is never satisfied with his self-centredness.<br><br>The other obstacle to sharing our money is fear. We are frightened that we wi1l leave ourselves short if we give it away; not short perhaps in the present, because we can estimate that, but in the future with all its uncertainties. The answer to this sort of fear is faith in God's faithfulness in the future. It is he who has given us our present possessions and he has promised that, if we seek to do his will, he will give to us what we need when we need it. God is in control of every event in our world, including the business world, and the world of our own private life. He has promised us a wonderful heavenly inheritance, and Christians should live in the light of that promise. He has promised provision for the rest of life that is this side of heaven, and we should live in the light of this promise as well. So when you are tempted to hesitate in helping other people in their real need as you come across the need, remember God's promise to be faithful. He who has given us life will give us the means to sustain life and not only our life, but the life of our children too. Indeed, as St Paul says, the love of God is such that we have no grounds for fear. He wrote, "God who spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not freely with him give us every thing?" We have a great inheritance in the future. Christ has provided it through his death, and we have already begun to enjoy it through his Spirit. If we keep our thoughts on this inheritance, we won't clutch to ourselves what God has given us in this life, but will share it with generosity. Sharing is the first great principle in the use of our money.<br><br><br><b>Service</b><br><br>In considering the Christian's use of his money, another principle to be remembered is that no-one, whether Christian or non-Christian, should ever have as a primary aim the aim to make money. This is because such an aim, when it is the primary aim, is self-centred and we should never be self-centred in our actions towards others. The use of money, whether in business or in any other way, should be with the object of service. This is the principle exemplified by Jesus Christ, the Son of God "who is among you as one who serves". If we aim primarily at making money when we are in contact with other people, we aim at something selfish; we are looking to our own self interests rather than the interests of those with whom we are in contact, and this remains true whether we expand the concept of self into self and family, or into religious objectives in which we are interested.<br><br>Consequently, in our use of money, whether we are conducting a business or developing a property or investing in shares, our primary aim and motive must never be to make money but rather to see how we can serve other people with the money God has put in our control. This applies to all people but especially, of course, to Christians and the Christian church.<br><br>For example, if we have a block of land which we wish to develop, it must not be primarily to make money from it; but we must ask ourselves whether through the development we are serving the community. Similarly, if we are landlords, we must, in conducting our business with our tenants, not primarily aim to make money out of them but rather to serve them. If we are businessmen, our business must be conducted to confer benefit on our customers, and similarly directors of public companies must not be primarily interested in the size of the profit which they are able to announce in their annual report to the shareholders, but they must be primarily concerned with the people their company comes into contact with through its business. All this does not mean that we are not to make money. Of course we need to make a profit if we are going to maintain our home and family, and if we are going to have money to invest for the better development of community resources; but the primary aim and motivation of our actions when we are in relation to other people must not be to make money but rather to serve those other people.<br><br>The money under our control, or the property which we own, is simply that part of God's creation which we have the responsibility for using. And we must use it in accordance with the character of God, its creator.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Kansas, the Politics of Culture and the General Election">(March 2001) Kansas, the Politics of Culture and the General Election</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Joe Wright's prayer</b><br><br>In a published sermon Dr James Kennedy, the Pastor of the huge Coral Ridge Prebyterian Church, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, tells of another American pastor, Joe Wright, from the Central Christian Church, Wichita. Not so long ago Pastor Joe had been invited to "deliver the invocation" at the Kansas State Legislature. But he caused something of an uproar.<br><br>In fact no sooner had he ended his prayer than three Representatives on the State Legislature were on their feet at microphones and protesting. "He can't talk like that about us!" shouted Representative Delbert Gross, calling the invocation "divisive", "sanctimonious" and "overbearing". Representative David Haley called it "blasphemous and ignorant". Representative Sabrina Standifer agreed. <br><br>So what had Pastor Joe prayed? He had prayed as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask your forgiveness and to seek your direction and guidance.We know your word says, "Woe to those who call evil good," but that is exactly what we have done. We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and inverted our values.We confess that we have ridiculed the absolute truth of your word in the name of moral pluralism.We have worshipped other gods and called it "multi-culturalism".We have endorsed perversion and called it an "alternative lifestyle".We have exploited the poor and called it "a lottery".We have neglected the needy and called it "self-preservation".We have rewarded laziness and called it "welfare".In the name of "choice" we have killed our unborn.In the name of "right to life" we have killed abortionists.We have neglected to discipline our children and called it "building esteem".We have abused power and called it "political savvy".We've coveted our neighbours' possessions and called it "taxes".We've polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it "freedom of expression." We've ridiculed the time-honoured values of our forefathers and called it "enlightenment".Search us, O God, and know our hearts today. Try us, and show us [if there be] any wicked ways in us. Cleanse us from every sin, and set us free.Guide and bless these men and women who have been sent here by the people of Kansas and who have been ordained by you to govern this great State.Grant them your wisdom to rule, and may their decisions direct us to the centre of you will.I ask it in the name of your Son, the living Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.</div></blockquote>

<p>Many people in the United Kingdom would say, "Only in America!" But perhaps that is a reflection of our own spiritual inertia. We could not imagine someone praying like that here on a public occasion. But Jeremiah, the Old Testament prophet, would have prayed like that. And Pastor Joe did.<br><br><br><b>The Politics of Culture</b><br><br>Nor were these issues Joe Wright prayed about irrelevant to the Kansas State Legislature. They were and are highly relevant both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, they are moving to the centre of public life. <br><br>Many are now claiming that what is fundamental for our public life are no longer the old issues that used to divide the "left" and the "right" but what are called "cultural" issues. I have quoted elsewhere (Church and State in the New Millennium, p viii) a consultation paper from our own Lord Chancellor's Department. It draws attention to the argument ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... that recent trends in society indicate that politics is becoming more cultural or value based ... Party loyalties, it is said, have become weakened where traditional left/right supporters have become more volatile and are voting according to issue or value priorities.</div></blockquote>

<p>It then speaks of "a variety of issues including sex, homosexuality, education, religion, drugs and single parents" as key "post-material non-economic concerns" for public life.<br><br>And it is the same in the United States. Francis Fukuyama, the Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University, Washington DC, also admits that these moral and cultural issues are now centre stage. But he does not seem to see any great hope of "remoralization" through the current political agendas of the main parties. <br><br>He admits that the evidence has been well marshalled to prove that the decline of the traditional, two-parent married family is socially disastrous. But in the current situation, political proposals aimed to redress things, like reintroducing marriage tax allowances, are little more than "symbolic hand waving". <br><br>"This," says Fukuyama, "leaves many [ethical] conservatives hoping for a religious revival, or a cultural shift like the one that took place during the Victorian era." Many are merely complaining about "moral decline" in a society in which "the greatest moral passion turns out to be hostility to 'moralism' in areas related to sex and family life." However, he claims that "the cultural issues are the only ones still capable of stimulating voter passion." <br><br>Richard Neuhaus comments on Fukuyama as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>[he] is undoubtedly correct in recognizing that most [ethical] conservatives, thinking themselves to be hard-nosed realists, have not faced the reality that politics today is pre-eminently the politics of culture. Deploring moral decline is necessary, lest we get used to the way things are, but it is not enough. The winning side will be the side that more convincingly articulates a more promising future that both accommodates legitimate interests and appeals to a sense of moral possibility.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Shifting the public agenda</b><br><br>This is now, therefore, the time for Christians to be in the front line. We need to help shift the public agenda to these moral issues and work for new political commitments. For example, we need to challenge our candidates at the forthcoming General Election over their party's position on "pro-life" and family issues such as abortion, euthanasia, research on embryos, sexuality and marriage; on church and state issues - especially matters of religious freedom, and not least in respect of religious broadcasting where Christians are discriminated against; and on education and the importance of parental choice.<br><br>Christians will, rightly, be concerned about many other issues. But these are issues where if Christians do not take action, no one else will. <br><br>Of course, evangelism has a priority over political action and argument, as "faith" has a priority (theologically) over "works". Faith in Christ is the only way to begin, really, to live a new life. Unless there is a spiritual revival there is little long term hope for a moral revival in Britain. <br><br>But God out of his "common grace" has provided us with laws and governing institutions to restrain evil, to show us our need of a Saviour, and to guide us in right living. Our Christian duty is to pray and therefore, in so far as we can, work for laws and governing institutions that are more, rather than less, in accord with the God's word. So Paul writes to Timothy that he is to pray ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Saviour, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2.2-4).</div></blockquote>

                <p><b>Success, not failure</b><br><br>David Blunkett, the current Secretary of State for Education, is rightly concerned about poor standards in education. "We need," he says, "a dramatic increase in the number of successful schools in our cities." <br><br>Sadly there are too many failing schools in the Newcastle LEA. While the national average for 5 or more A-C's (the higher grades) at GCSE was in 2000 49%, in Newcastle it was 35%. Even Sheffield could average 41%. By contrast Emmanuel College Gateshead, a Christian City Technology College with two-thirds coming from "less advantaged areas", averaged 98%.<br><br>Emmanuel College recently had an OfSTED inspection. The report was published in March 2001. It makes remarkable reading, so glowing is the inspection team's account of the school. Interestingly, in answer to "what pleases parents most," they list the following (and in this order):<br><br>•	the Christian beliefs and values. <br>•	the way the college is led and managed. <br>•	teaching is good and children make good progress. <br>•	behaviour is good. <br>•	the college's high expectations. <br>•	children are helped to become mature and responsible.<br><br>But David Blunkett is aware that there is no simple solution.<br><br>"No single approach will solve all problems; but radical innovation in the creation of new schools is one option. City Academies will provide for this ... These academies will be publicly funded independent schools with private and voluntary sector sponsorship and management, tackling the problems of poor performance with greater freedom than currently available to maintained schools. Business, the churches, and the voluntary sector are all potential sponsors and partners for City Academies ... City Academies will also take account of the best lessons from the experience of City Technology Colleges and Charter Schools in the United States" (The prospectus for sponsors and other partners, 'City Academies - schools to make a difference').<br><br>In the light of this virtual invitation Paul Merton of Westgate Road Baptist Church, Clive Harding of Bethshan Pentecostal Church, Desmond Chong of the Chinese Church and I went to see the Newcastle Director of Education on 13 March 2001. The following is the formal summary of our position as presented to the Director in Newcastle and presented to the DfEE in London.<br><br><br><b>The general position, concerns and objectives of the sponsoring group</b><br><br>Representing churches of different and diverse denominations, we have formed ourselves into a non-denominational sponsoring group for a City Academy for Newcastle upon Tyne. <br><br>We believe that this will be a catalyst for growth and development for some of the most deprived members of our community. We have a particular concern for the inner West Riverside area of the city. We believe that a City Academy run to the standards and with the ethos we propose will bring renewed confidence to the area and in turn produce significant social and economic regeneration. <br><br>We are greatly encouraged to see that our concerns have now been articulated by the Prime Minister. At his recent Downing Street seminar with head teachers and other leading educationalists he expressed his desire to see a general improvement in secondary level education. Particularly he wishes to see, one, "greater diversity and choice" in education; two, a raising of standards of achievement among 11-14 year olds; three, vocational concerns and more flexibility in the national curriculum; and, four, greater managerial freedom with the employment of sponsors from the business world. We heartily concur with these "four points" which are endorsed by the Green Paper launched by David Blunkett. <br><br>We will see ourselves as a partner school in the family of schools of Newcastle upon Tyne ready to share what we are doing with others and equally desirous to learn from others. <br><br>The academy will offer a VIth Form with a realistic range of courses and so provide a pathway for those who want it and need it to higher education. <br><br><br><b>Sponsorship</b><br><br>We have secured the co-operation of Mr Peter Vardy, a North East businessman, who has already expressed his commitment to education through his sponsorship of one of the most successful City Technology Colleges in the country, Emmanuel College Gateshead. While we expect our Academy to be different to Emmanuel, our Academy will have a similar Christian philosophy and we anticipate similar high academic standards from disadvantaged children. Mr Vardy will be involved in direct financial terms. <br><br>Mr Nigel Robson, the chairman of the Newcastle Committee, Chamber of Trade and Commerce, is a business professional who strongly supports our proposals. He believes that our project will play a significant part in helping towards the revitalization of the North East. <br><br><br><b>Specialism</b><br><br>We propose that our specialism will be technology including ICT. We also envisage an imaginative language programme that could involve languages such as Cantonese and Latin as well as the modern European languages. We, of course, are concerned to see excellence in sport and also the creative arts, including music and film/radio/TV production skills. <br><br>We will, however, be concerned for all subjects, both in the arts and sciences. We will expect them all to be taught to the same high level. <br><br><br><b>Ethos</b><br><br>We are a Christian group with a mainstream Christian ethos. We represent some of the largest churches in the city from a range of denominations Anglican, Baptist and Pentecostal as well as the new and growing Chinese Church. But we are emphatically "non-denominational". We express our joint philosophy and what will be the philosophy of the academy as "Mere Christianity" - the title of a book by the famous writer and academic, C.S.Lewis. <br><br>We, however, are committed to a policy of "open" admissions. No tests will be applied to any parent who is willing to accept the ethos of the school. We, therefore, expect parents from other religious traditions and none to want to enrol their children. Such, we believe, will be the success and excellence of the school. <br><br>We will also hold a daily act of worship in accordance with the Education Reform Act 1988 and our religious education will, of course, involve the teaching of Christianity but also teaching about other world religions and non-religious philosophies. <br><br>We will be concerned to help children be clear on moral issues and we will expect pupils to finish their school careers being able clearly to distinguish right from wrong. <br><br>Our sex education will be premised on the view that two married parents committed together for life are in the best interests of the children while recognizing the need for the support of children from disrupted families and all the pressures that young people are under today. <br><br>Our ethos will seek to produce "good citizens". This will come through our training for public life. It will also come from our clear discipline but exercised in a secure and caring environment. <br><br>We see every human being as unique and of value in the sight of God from whatever background or environment. We will, therefore, seek to address the needs of every individual pupil. With those with potential or actual learning difficulties we will develop a strategy to raise their attainments. <br><br>We will seek to develop firm links with the business community in order to enhance the employment and life opportunities for our pupils.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Race, Culture and Religion">(May 2001) Race, Culture and Religion</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Race</b><br><br>At the end of April 2001 the issue of "race" was highlighted in the run-up to the General Election. <br><br>Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary was reported as claiming that chicken tikka massala was now "Britain's true national dish". The curry, he was saying, is not only the country's most popular food having displaced more traditional recipes such as roast beef. But it is also "the perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The massala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of a British people to have their meat served in gravy." These remarks, made at the Centre for the Open Society, were part of a Labour response to the suggestion by a Tory MP, John Townend, that mass immigration has undermined Anglo-Saxon society (John Townend has since apologized).<br><br>In part, for many in Britain sensitivity to the question of "race" is due to the history of racism in Europe over the last century and a half. It started with a French ethnologist and social thinker, Joseph-Arthur Gobineau (1816-1882) and his 1850s Essay on the Inequality of Human Races. Gobineau's theories are now discredited; but he claimed the superiority of the white race over all others and said the "Aryans" (i.e. the Germanic peoples) were the summit of civilization and this race must be kept pure and not be "mixed" with other races. Also emerging in the 1850s was the philosophy of the Englishman Charles Darwin. The Christian doctrine of creation had made all men and women equal before God. The Fatherhood of God indeed gave rise to the brotherhood of man. But deny God, as Darwin did in his macro-evolutionism, and you soon lose equality and brotherhood. In its place you have racism. The subtitle of his Origin of Species was "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life" (and "races" included human races). In a letter written to W.Graham in 1881 Darwin spoke about "natural selection having done and doing more for the progress of civilization than you seem inclined to admit." He went on:</p>

<blockquote><div>Remember what risk the nations of Europe ran, not so many centuries ago of being overwhelmed by the Turks, and how ridiculous such an idea now is! The more civilized so-called Caucasian races have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence. Looking to the world at no very distant date, what an endless number of the lower races will have been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world.</div></blockquote>

<p>In the 20th century the views of Gobineau and Darwin influenced Hitler. It is the horrors of Nazi Germany and Hitler's attack especially on the Jewish race together with memories of the Holocaust that rightly cause fears in Britain. In Mein Kampf Hitler summarized his racism as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Every manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and technical skill, which we see before our eyes today, is almost exclusively the product of the Aryan alone who founded a superior type of humanity ... he is the Prometheus of mankind, from whose shining brow the divine spark of genius has at all times flashed forth.</div></blockquote>

<p>These racist philosophies all reject God as the determinant of life and put nature "red in tooth and claw", and so biology, in his place. Reject God and your physical make-up is all you are left with. In the words of the atheist Nietzsche, who held that Darwin was "true but deadly", there was now "the lack of any cardinal distinction between man and animal". All this soon led to the worship of competition, power, and violence and the rejection of convention, ethics and faith. It justified nationalism, imperialism, militarism, dictatorship, the cult of the superman (or the Führer - the title Hitler gave himself) and the master race. In the light of Hitler it is not unreasonable for there to be an immediate reaction in Europe against a racism that denies the intrinsic equality of every individual whatever their genes or skin colour.<br><br><br><b>Culture</b><br><br>But to reject "right-wing" racism does not mean you must adopt an uncritical "left-wing" multi-culturalism. That is because, as has been said, "culture does not stem from people's genes or skin colour. Rather culture consists of society's institutionalised values, beliefs, and practices that are learned through human interaction, not biologically inherited"; and while some aspects of culture are good and to be enjoyed, some aspects of culture are bad and to be rejected. In the words of the Lausanne Covenant: "Because man is God's creature, some of his culture is rich in beauty and goodness. Because he is fallen, all of it is tainted with sin and some of it is demonic." <br><br>And there are evil aspects to cultures still in the world today. In some areas there are fewer than there were thanks to Christian missionaries. Because these missionaries saw a better way of living - living according to God's plan - often at great personal cost they told people about Jesus Christ and that better way. For example, James Chalmers (1841-1901), a Scottish missionary, pioneered evangelistic work in New Guinea. He helped transform a violent cannibalistic culture by preaching the gospel. He himself, in the end, was murdered by a small group of local people. But such is the post-modern anti-Christian version of multi-culturalism that in the week after Easter the BBC felt free to show a film of a descendant of Chalmers visiting Papua New Guinea (and his area of work) and "apologizing" for what he had done! <br><br>Of course, not all cultural activity is equal. A relevant example for today is clitoridectomy - an age-old cultural practice in parts of the world. It is popularly called "female circumcision". Minimally it involves the removal of a girl's clitoris. Frequently it involves much more genital mutilation so that she is incapable of ever experiencing sexual pleasure. A few immigrants to Britain still want this. In the same way as "racism" should be outlawed, so, surely, should clitoridectomy. A similar example was suttee - an age old cultural practice in India where a widow was burnt alive on her husband's funeral pyre. The British outlawed this in 1829 as being wrong. They were right to do so. <br><br>What about the ancient Aztecs of Mexico? They were a war-waging people who fought primarily to acquire prisoners needed for human sacrifices. All cultures contain what is wrong. This was certainly true of Britain in the 19th century. Why were Lord Shaftesbury's humanitarian reforms needed? Because there was much that was wrong in British public culture. There can be no-blanket "multi-culturalism". Yes, of course, cultural diversity is to be welcomed as adding social colour, but not if it is damaging or dangerous.<br><br><br><b>Religion</b><br><br>One of the confusions today is that race (or "ethnicity") is confused with religion. Religion, of course, is at the heart of most cultures. But in our own country today there are many Christians from non-British backgrounds and many British who are not Christian. And religion is now even being defined as "ethnicity". "Ethnic cleansing" is often the new term for religious repression. This is due to depictions of the former Yugoslavia where war between Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Muslims was regularly described as "ethnic". <br><br>This confusion means that arguing for the value of a multi-racial society is assumed to be arguing for a multi-faith society where questions of truth are excluded. Of course, that is not so. The Christian church is the most multi-racial of all societies, but it is a missionary society. It respects people of other faiths but it seeks to win them to Jesus Christ. The goal is not to have many Lords and many faiths, but one Lord and one faith (Ephesians 4.5). So, what in conclusion does the bible say about race, culture and religion? <br><br>First, heaven is going to be populated by "a great multitude that no-one can count, from every nation, tribe, people and language" (Rev 7.9). It is going to be multi-racial. Multi-racialism, in that sense, must be good.<br><br>Secondly, Paul when preaching in Athens affirmed the basic unity of the human race. There are no grounds for arguing, therefore, that there is an archetypal superior race. "From one man [God] made every nation of men" (Acts 17.26).<br><br>Thirdly, the bible teaches that there is "splendour" and "glory" in the different national cultures. Where it is good it should be celebrated. Revelation 21.24 speaks of the "splendour of the kings of the earth" and 21.26 speaks of "the glory and honour of the nations". In that sense there can be a right version of "multi-culturalism".<br><br>Fourthly, Jesus is the only way to God. Of course there must be rights for people of other faiths, but not the "multi-faithism" of today that eviscerates all truth claims. Paul concluded his address at Athens with these words (Acts 17.30-31):</p>

<blockquote><div>God ... now ... commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.</div></blockquote>

<p>Those who repent become part of God's new society - his church in which racial, national, social and sexual distinctions must be secondary, "for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3.28).<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Vision for the Nation - a Christian Manifesto">(June 2001) A Vision for the Nation - a Christian Manifesto</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>

<blockquote><div>Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people (Proverbs 14.34)</div></blockquote>

<p>The following is an initiative sponsored by Church Society and now assented to by 1000 church leaders<br><br><br><b>Introduction</b><br><br>We the above Christian ministers and church elders, who believe that God has made himself known to mankind, who hold the truth of the Ten Commandments and teach the Christian ethic of the Bible, are resolved in the power of the Holy Spirit that the Lord Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life.<br><br>We shall proclaim God's Word (the Bible) knowing it is able to bring people, whatever their past, into a right relationship with God through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and that it teaches the right way to live. In doing this we will encourage all people to be good citizens, to do all things to the glory of God, and to enjoy him for ever.<br><br>We state the following principles which we believe are of first importance to all people.<br><br><br><b>The manifesto</b><br><br>We affirm that, in his goodness, God has given to the peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland relative security, stability and prosperity. <br><br>We affirm that civil government is a means ordained by God for maintaining good order in communities. <br><br>We affirm that the prime duty of civil government is to uphold truth and virtue and to restrain wickedness and vice. <br><br>We affirm that civil leaders are called by God, the supreme Lord and King of the world, to honour him in all that they do so as to serve him and people not with pride but in humility. <br><br>We affirm that Christians are to pray for all people, including especially those in authority, and to demonstrate in their lives that God's way is the best way. <br><br>We affirm that the moral relativism and libertarian values which dominate public life have had disastrous consequences for our nation. The institution of marriage has been seriously undermined and deep damage has been done to family life. The abortion rate continues to rise, especially among young women and teenage girls. Since 1995, despite efforts to promote "safer sex", diagnoses of sexually transmitted diseases have risen dramatically. The rising levels of crime provide evidence of a lack of respect for people and their property. <br><br>We affirm that the institution of marriage is the God ordained basis for a well ordered society and that the only form of marriage that should be recognized in civil law is the union of one man with one woman voluntarily entered into for life to the exclusion of all others. <br><br>We affirm that heterosexual marriage is the most conducive to good and stable family life and that a recognition of this should be seen in both adoption law and the tax and benefit system. <br><br>We affirm that sex is a gift from God which is to be enjoyed only within lifelong heterosexual monogamous marriage and that the failure to teach chastity within marriage and abstinence by those not married is an affront to Almighty God and has encouraged the promotion of promiscuity. <br><br>We affirm that same sex sexual activity is always sinful and contrary to God's law and, therefore, call for the retention of the legislation that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality in schools. <br><br>We affirm that responsibility for the upbringing of children lies primarily with parents and that it is important for schools to respect and help them in this duty. <br><br>We affirm the need for and value of an education system which is based on and respects core Christian values and that the teaching of the Bible provides the best moral instruction for children. <br><br>We affirm the importance of daily corporate acts of Christian worship in all state schools, the vital place of teaching the Christian gospel and Christian ethics in the basic curriculum, and that local and national government should facilitate the provision of Christian schools whether church or parent controlled. <br><br>We affirm that human life from the moment of conception is a gift from God which has a dignity because it reflects God and, therefore, that the use of human embryos for experimentation and cloning and the deliberate killing of unborn children in abortion seriously undermines the claim that we live in a civilized society. <br><br>We affirm, as life is God-given, that proper care should be provided for the handicapped, elderly and terminally ill in a way which respects the dignity of the individual, and that euthanasia should not be legalized in any form. <br><br>We affirm that the preservation of the Lord's Day, the first day of the week, as a day of godly rest and worship is essential for society, that its character should be protected, and that proper and suitable safeguards should be given to employees. <br><br>We affirm that the depiction of violence, blasphemy and immorality on television and the internet, and in newspapers and magazines, is destructive and that proper restraints and clear moral guidelines are required. <br><br>We affirm, in this age of digital communication, that full opportunity should be given to Christians to hold broadcasting licences thus giving them freedom to provide interesting and wholesome alternatives. <br><br>We affirm that they use of drugs for recreational purposes is both dangerous and destructive and that appropriate sanctions should be enforced to restrict the supply and use of them. <br><br>We affirm that the state promotion of gambling through the National Lottery is wrong in principle and detrimental to society. <br><br>Being grateful for help already given, we affirm that every assistance should be made in tax and regulation to enable Christian charities to prosper in the vital work undertaken by them, be it at a local, national or international level. <br><br>We affirm that support should be given to the needy and persecuted in countries such as Burma, Indonesia and the Sudan. <br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>We list these principles to encourage informed debate. We call upon our political leaders and parties to include the concerns of these key issues in any future legislative programme. We urge voters to consider them carefully as they use their vote at an election. At the same time we encourage all Christians to make these issues a matter of prayer and to continue in prayer for our nation and its leaders.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A New Broadcasting Debate">(August 2001) A New Broadcasting Debate</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>There needs to be a new public debate about the electronic media in terms of values, beliefs and morals. Let me begin by outlining the story so far.<br><br><br><b>History</b><br><br>In 1984 the then Head of Religious Broadcasting at the BBC, Colin Morris, wrote about "a revolutionary take-over of society accomplished without a shot being fired". He went on to say that the local agent of the revolution "sits demurely in your sitting-room, staring at you glassy-eyed – your television set." The revolution continues in 2001. But it is (and has been) subtle. There are the "shockers" – like the recent Channel 4 production on paedophilia Brass Eye. However, it is not the outrageous or obviously biased radio or TV programmes that bring about cultural change. As David Winter, a later Head of Religious Programmes at BBC Radio put it:</p>

<blockquote><div>The main impact of television is not through single programmes, however controversial or newsworthy, but through the steady trickle of attitudes, views and opinions.</div></blockquote>

<p>It is the less overtly shocking programmes, like Channel 4's Big Brother, that are the subtle power houses of change. That the recent winner was homosexual did far more for the public acceptability of what the bible teaches is immoral behaviour than did Channel 4's Queer as Folk screened in 1999. The chief-executive of Channel 4 described the latter as "a significant programme"; but one paper at the time described it as "the most outrageous show to hit the small screen in years." The shockers are like an initial burst of heavy artillery. Then comes the slow slog of the infantry - the "drip, drip" of regular fare that accepts the changing of the moral goal posts. <br><br>And this has been going all the time that the believing Christian community has experienced positive exclusion and censorship. Back in 1987 one senior BBC drama producer said rather cynically that in broadcasting you can be committed to anything except Christianity. In 2001 things have now evolved to such a position that, for the first time ever, the Head of Religious programmes or rather, as it is now called, "Religion and Ethics" is an admitted agnostic!<br><br>Yet when many of these secularists have to work in Broadcasting House in central London, as they walk in they see a dedicatory inscription (in Latin). When it is translated it is found to be full of biblical and Christian allusions:</p>

<blockquote><div>This temple of the arts and muses is dedicated to Almighty God by the first Governors of Broadcasting in the year 1931, Sir John Reith being Director General. It is their prayer that good seed sown may bring forth a good harvest; that all things hostile to peace and purity may be banished from this house and that the people inclining their ear to whatsoever things are beautiful and honest and of good report may tread the path of wisdom and uprightness.</div></blockquote>

<p>The founding father of British broadcasting was John Reith – a Christian. On October 1922 he heard a sermon on Ezekiel's words: "Thus saith the Lord, 'I sought a man to stand in the gap'." That night he wrote in his diary, "I still believe there is some great work for me to do in the world." He then saw an advert for a "general manager" of a company involved in what was called "broadcasting". He applied and was appointed. Under Lord Reith the British Broadcasting Company had an avowed aim of bringing "the best of everything into the greatest possible number of homes." And with regard to the Christian faith, Reith said, "Christianity happens to be the stated and official religion of the country; it is recognized by the Crown. This is a fact which those who have criticized our right to broadcast the Christian religion would do well to bear in mind." <br><br>Twenty five years later in 1948 the then General Director of the BBC, Sir William Haley, underlined that philosophy in these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>There are many demands of impartiality laid on the Corporation, but this [about Christian values] is not one of them. We are citizens of a Christian country and the BBC – an institution set up by the State – bases its policy upon a positive attitude towards the Christian values. It seeks to safeguard those values and to foster acceptance of them. The whole preponderant weight of its programmes is directed towards this end.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Hugh Greene</b><br><br>But by 1965 "humanism" had taken over in the person of the new Director General, Sir Hugh Greene. He would only show partiality where "there are clashes for and against the basic moral values, truthfulness, justice, freedom, compassion and tolerance". This sounded so good and liberal. But it soon meant "freedom" from, not for, positive Christian values.<br><br>But who decided that a positive attitude towards full Christian values should be replaced by a reductionist form of ethics? Hugh Greene himself. Surely something is radically wrong when such power for restructuring the moral-cultural order is in the hands of unrepresentative single individuals or groups of individuals in the BBC or at the ITC.<br><br>However, there were other structural factors that precipitated moral change. On 22 September 1955 the monopoly of the BBC was broken with the inauguration of the first Independent Television channels. It was soon discovered that the commercial companies in those days were, as it was said, "a licence to print money". But the success of ITV meant that the BBC had to do something different to regain audiences. So the BBC tried "social realism", which meant an absence of social graces and a surfeit of bad language – something new in broadcasting. The second important structural factor in the sixties was the opening of a second BBC channel. The significance of BBC 2 was that all of a sudden you had to increase the pool of broadcasters by (potentially) 50%. This meant that many young people, often from Oxford and Cambridge, had to be taken on board in disproportionate numbers. Also, promotion came earlier and younger to some others already in the BBC. The net result was a great influx or promotion of creative people who had not learned the Reith ways. Add to that the fact that outside – in the moral-cultural sphere – it was a "low" in the church's life. This was the hey-day of the "new theology" of the book Honest to God (by Bishop John Robinson) and The Death of God theology. All was ripe for an explosion. The match that lit the touch paper was Hugh Greene.<br><br>It is not insignificant that Hugh Charlton Greene was an expert in the psychological manipulation of the media. He had masterminded the BBC's broadcasts to Nazi Germany during the war and had headed up the Psychological Warfare Department in Malaya during the emergency. But whether you want someone like that in charge when "winning back the viewers" is a priority, is questionable.<br><br>Nor was Greene just giving the public what it wanted. Greene was trying to be ahead of public opinion. He generated permissiveness. In Rome in 1965 he said this:<br><br>In its search for truth, indeed in whatever it undertakes, a broadcasting organization must recognize an obligation towards tolerance and towards the maximum liberty of expression … I believe that broadcasters have a duty not to be diverted by arguments in favour of what is, in fact, disguised censorship. I believe we have a duty to take account of the changes in society, to be ahead of public opinion rather than always to wait upon it … Outrage is impermissible. Shock is not always so. Provocation may be healthy and indeed socially imperative.<br><br><br><b>Channel 4</b><br><br>Then sometime later, in 1982, came the setting up of the ITV second channel, Channel 4. This heralded even more radical and aggressive changes. The (outgoing) chief executive, Michael Jackson, has written an "end of term" report for The Observer newspaper (29 July 2001). He said his leaving concentrated his mind on "some of the profound social changes that have occurred in British society and the role television has taken in these changes." His conclusions are ominous. "Only by looking back over how far broadcasting has come and the cultural contribution it has made can we begin to presume the potential of its future influence."<br><br>His understanding was that "twenty years ago television didn't honestly reflect society". Certain minorities, particularly the homosexual minority, were not, he argues, represented. The remit of Channel 4 was to change all that - and with a vengeance. He now claims that "in 2001 the 'minorities' of those times have been assimilated into the mainstream society." He continues:<br><br>for a moment this summer it was conceivable that a man who admitted to a past gay relationship could become leader of the Conservative Party. On Friday [27 July] a gay man won Big Brother. Obviously, these two events are not connected. But they are not unconnected. Over the past 18 years there has been a sea change in social values and the way individuals identify themselves within society. Channel 4, I believe, by way of its original remit has contributed to that change in society by taking a unique role in encouraging and provoking debate and diversity.<br><br>And Michael Jackson reminds us that Channel 4 has been in the forefront of the drugs debate - by which he means the legalisation, certainly, of cannabis. His exit also appears at a time that Channel 4 is in the forefront of the debate about paedophilia with its production Brass Eye. Already paedophilia is gaining acceptance in the United States in the media and in "learned societies". It is following the course of the acceptance of homosexuality. In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association (APA) depathologized homosexuality - that is to say, it ceased to be a problem condition. American practitioners had to treat it simply as an alternative form of sexual expression. We now know that the whirlwind was reaped in the form of HIV, AIDS and an escalation of sexually transmitted diseases. But along with the fact that cannabis contains four times the carcenogenic tar of tobacco and, more seriously, induces psychosis, these facts are ignored as "frontiers are pushed." Indeed in the US the APA is now depathologizing paedophilia except where the paedophile is "markedly distressed" at his activity. And here in 1997 the gay campaigner Peter Tatchell was vehemently denounced when he wrote to The Guardian (26 June 1997) in support of a book published by the Gay Men's Press entitled Dares to Speak. The book, he reported, "challenges the assumption that all sex involving children and adults is abusive. I think it is courageous." He concludes, "Several of my friends - gay and straight, male and female - had sex with adults from the ages of nine to 13. None feel they were abused. All say it was their conscious choice and gave them great joy. While it may be impossible to condone paedophilia, it is time society acknowledged the truth that not all sex involving children is unwanted, abusive and harmful." But has Peter Tatchell quietly retired from public debate? No! He was recently invited to be on one of the BBC's prestigious panel discussion programmes.<br><br><br><b>Current decadence</b><br><br>There is no evidence of any plot going on. What we are dealing with is, to use the now overused word, "institutional" decadence. What is happening is that under the banner of pluralism, automatically a value system of the "lowest common denominator" is being generated. To give public and totally value-free space to previously "tabooed" behaviours and issues, is to legitimize those behaviours and issues. This was certainly happening in the month of July [2001]. In EastEnders, the newspapers tell us, Steve Owen - the hardman - was shown having a lingering, incestuous kiss with his dying mother. And apparently EastEnders is going to report that Harry Slater is a paedophile who raped his own niece. We are back to the "social realism" of the sixties. The claim is that TV is fearlessly portraying issues that are usually obscured. But the social point of "taboos" is that behaviours that are socially damaging can only be safely discussed under controlled circumstances. They do not lend themselves to be scripted into soap operas. As Jenny McCartney said (Sunday Telegraph 29 July 2001):</p>

<blockquote><div>soaps now strive to pack more 'realism' into a single episode than most of us have the misfortune to experience in a lifetime. Mere affairs are passé: producers are constantly truffling around in the kitbag of incest, abuse and betrayal, searching for the next big taboo that will shock the nation and send their ratings soaring. There is one central difficulty: shock is rather like a drug, and, within a relatively short time, the public finds that a dose of material that it once found startling is no longer strong enough to produce a reaction. A lesbian kiss on Brookside, for example, caused a sensation a few years ago: then, in 1999, the programme was chastised for the graphic portrayal of an attempted rape. Today, the hot topic for debate has shifted to the darker ground of EastEnders' mother-son incest.</div></blockquote>

<p>With regard to the first series of Big Brother she pointed out that a kiss between two of the housemates was enough to provoke a furore. "The makers of the second series, however, actively pushed the participants to have sex live on camera, setting up a 'love-shack' for the use of any willing couple. Channel 4 relentlessly promoted the burgeoning romance between Paul, a car designer, and Helen, a giggly blonde Welsh hairdresser, along the theme of 'will they or won't they have sex?'" But the main ITV networks were one degree worse, she was suggesting: "Earlier in the week [the last week of July] ... Charlotte Hobrough was announced as the £1 million winner of Survivor. The details of her affair with a fellow contestant on the island (as her humiliated husband waited at home) had also been widely publicised."<br><br><br><b>The Christian response</b><br><br>In the early days of broadcasting there was a "Sunday Committee". It later became knows as the Central Religious Advisory Committee (CRAC). Under Reith's guidance a substantial amount of positive Christian programming developed. The pass was sold, however, in 1977 when CRAC established new guidelines that opened the door to a "multi-faith mishmash" of religious programming that has pleased nobody. <br><br>On a personal front as a curate in Leeds I helped produce religious progammes for the second of the BBC's new local radio stations, Radio Leeds. I also tried to encourage students to become involved in the electronic media - some did. It then, however, became obvious that it was no good trying to promote more competent Christian producers if they were only to be given the "dead hours" around mid-night for their programmes. So Christians needed to be involved in management. But at that time (the end of the seventies) no Christian group could apply for a radio or TV licence. This was manifestly unfair. However, it seemed sensible to try every door. So after I had been at Jesmond for seven years, in 1980 I convened a consortium - TeleVision North (TVN) - to bid for the NE TV franchise (Tyne-Tees). This could not be a Christian group, but it contained a significant number of committed Christians in the team. We actually were awarded the franchise, along with the other two applicants, so long as all the groups combined. We declined. The other two joined forces and became the parent company of Tyne-Tees. By this time, it was self-evident to me that unless you could have direct Christian ownership you would have no control. So it then seemed necessary to work for a change in the law. <br><br>The Peacock Report of July 1986 suggested there be deregulation but with subsidized Public Service Broadcasting still to provide services that otherwise would be edged out by market forces. It, surely, was only fair that Christian groups should now have, at last, full access to television channels and radio broadcasting frequencies - of course, properly limited by the (reasonable) laws of the land and the constraints of the market place. With the good help of the Labour MP, Donald Anderson, Christians were secured, in the mid-80's, access to cable channels. But they still had no access to terrestrial channels. In the late 80's, therefore, some of us were involved in a campaign entitled Christian Choice in Broadcasting. That resulted in the 1990 Broadcasting Act allowing Christians to have local (not national) radio licences, but still no terrestrial TV licences. We (a group called Sound FM) promptly applied in 1993 for a Christian station in the North East. But it was likely all along that the Radio Authority would only award one new Christian licence. And it was likely that that would be in London as the applicants there, Premier Radio, had a far greater reach of people (we had 2 million, they had 10 million). Over the rest of the 90's it then seemed right to take stock, bide time, and see how things developed. They have clearly developed in a very nasty way. The last indignity is that Christians have recently been denied access to digital broadcasting.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>At every point concerned Christians in the UK have been up against great odds. There has been opposition from the churches as well as the world. Theologically liberal church people have fought against the freeing of regulations since such freedom would see the end of their privileges which grew following the sixties. Positive "believing" broadcasting is much more "listenable" and "watchable". Who wants to see religious programmes where their producer's stance is, "I don't know if this is true and I'm not bothered whether you think it is true or not; that is not my brief. All I am to do is to reflect, present and meet religious interests" (to quote the words of the CRAC guidelines). They know that secular managers concerned with the bottom line would probably prefer "believing" programming. Such liberal "deprivileging" occurred in the US. <br><br>But this then led some evangelical Christians to oppose the granting of freedoms for Christians on the grounds that such freedoms would open the door for American style tele-evangelists. This was short sighted. Tele-evangelists come in all shapes and sizes. Some are (in my judgement) in error, others are not - or considerably less so. But it is like the printing press. The 16th century Reformation would never have occurred if there had not been a free press. The price of Luther's ability to publish his magnum opus The Bondage of the Will was Erasmus' ability to publish his Diatribe. In any case, at the end of July [2001] we saw with the start of the Alpha series on ITV a series of religious programmes that has the same underlying charismatic theology as many of those US tele-evangelists. The jury is out on Alpha. At the time of writing I have only seen the first programme. But if there are things I disagree with about this series, my complaint will not be that Alpha has been screened, but that my (and others') concerns are not also screened, or rather cannot be screened at our cost and as of right.<br><br>While on holiday recently I read a stimulating little book by Harry Blamires entitled The Post-Christian Mind. It is an analysis of how the media have deconstructed Christian beliefs and values in the second half of the 20th century. He concludes: "A vast campaign is needed to clean up the mess." But he has no practical suggestions. Christians, of course, must pray and work. Perhaps, the first step is for a new, large and well-funded UK Christian media monitoring group to be set up capable of immediate response to offensive, biased or inaccurate programming. Any ignoring of rational responses could then be followed by strategies for financial sanctions - through representations to, and the publicizing of, advertizers that surround (and so fund) such programmes. With regard to the BBC it may well be time that we have a national campaign to abolish the licence fee. That is, at least, something that needs to be discussed as so many are seeing little value for money, nor is this just in terms of "religion and ethics" - but that is another story.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Bible as the Word of God">(September 2001) The Bible as the Word of God</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2001</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Controversy</b><br><br>On 23 July 2001 The Times newspaper reported that "a senior Church of England clergyman has been banned from preaching in a town's church after he had said in a sermon that the Bible was 'not the word of God'." The clergyman was Canon Derek Stanesby and the town was Uppingham, Rutland.<br><br>Derek Stanesby claims that "the Bible helps to point to the word of God, but it is not the word of God." He sees the Bible as "a rich and profound account of man's search for, and growing understanding of God ... It is one thing to hold that the Bible is an important part of God's ongoing revelation, but entirely other to maintain that God speaks literally and uniquely through its words."<br><br>Maureen Palmer, an ordained woman, spoke in support of Derek Stanesby:</p>

<blockquote><div>A lot of what he said in his sermon is what many clergy and lay people think. To say the Bible was written by different people and is therefore not the word of the Lord is not that unusual.</div></blockquote>

<p>All this then generated a response from readers. One church dignitary argued that Canon Stanesby was "orthodox" and those who opposed him "should lose their licence"! Fortunately others replied explaining why it is right to say that the Bible is the Word of God. The debate then spilled over into the church press. There in the Church Times one correspondent, Howard Peskett, a former staff member at Jesmond Parish Church, helpfully said: </p>

<blockquote><div>the main reason why we trust and preach the Bible as the word of God is out of loyalty to our Lord himself, who placed his imprimatur on the Old Testament, and invested his apostles with his authority through the Holy Spirit.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Psalm 119</b><br><br>Then on Sunday 12 August 2001 I had to preach at Jesmond on Psalm 119 in our evening series of studies. I had never preached on the Psalm before. Few people I imagine do preach on it at one go because of its length. But it, too, reminded me forcefully of how important it is that we get our thinking right about "God's word". For that Psalm is all about hearing and understanding God's word and the importance of framing our lives by it. Here is a sample of its teaching:</p>

<blockquote><div>How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word" (v 9).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (v 11).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Your word, O Lord, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens" (v 89).</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path" (v 105).</div></blockquote>

<p>But right at the beginning of the Bible is the lesson that the great temptation is to doubt God's word and so not obey it. The first words of the Serpent to Eve in the Garden of Eden were: "Did God really say ...?" (Gen 3.1). And it was Luther who said:</p>

<blockquote><div>The word of God is seldom retained in its purity in any one place beyond the period of twenty or at best forty years. The people become accustomed to it, grow cold in their Christian love, and regard God's give of grace with indifference.</div></blockquote>

<p>There is, obviously, huge confusion over the Bible in many places.<br><br><br><b>The Facts</b><br><br>There is, however, no doubt that Jesus Christ held and taught that the Jewish Scriptures (what we now call the Old Testament) were God's word written and vital to spiritual life. In contrast to Eve (and Adam) in the Garden of Eden, Jesus would not question God's word. Rather he resisted the Devil by quoting from the Old Testament. He pointed out that "Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4.4). <br><br>Nor is there any doubt that the concept of God communicating his ideas in written form goes right back to the giving of the Ten Commandments. These were inscribed on stone tablets and then, it was said, Moses was commanded by God to "record the stages" of the Exodus and then he "wrote down" God's law (Num 33.2; Deut 31.9). After that the Book of the Law was very significant in Jewish history. Of this there is no doubt.<br><br>Nor is there any doubt that the apostles of Jesus, just like Jesus, also saw the Jewish scriptures as God's word written. And after Jesus had taught them, they saw that Jesus was the fulfilment of these Jewish scriptures and that these scriptures, in God's providence, were God's word for them and for all believers. Nor is there any doubt that the apostles then saw their own, and only their own, teaching and writings as inspired in just the same way as the Old Testament was inspired. So it was natural for the early Christians to join their New Testament to the Jewish Old Testament as the final form of God's word written. None of this is open to doubt. The issue and the only issue is this: are we going to be true followers of Jesus or not?<br><br><br><b>Misconceptions</b><br><br>Now there can be serious misconceptions. For when we are saying that "the Bible is God's word written" we are not denying it is the work of individual writers with different personalities and different ways and styles of communicating. Nor are we saying that every word was "dictated" by God in a mechanical way. Paul says in 2 Timothy 3.16:</p>

<blockquote><div>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.</div></blockquote>

<p>But that inspiration of the Holy Spirit (or "God-breathing") is not a matter of methods but results. That is to say, the text of the Bible that, from the human perspective, was generated in so many different ways results in, from the divine perspective, precisely what God wanted written. So in Acts 4.25, for example, we read this: "You [the Sovereign Lord] spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: 'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?'" That is a quotation from Psalm 2. But it is clearly believed that those words, although penned by "your servant, our father David", came about "by the Holy Spirit", and were what "you [the Sovereign Lord] spoke". Paul's personal experience of inspiration is described in 1 Corinthians 2:12-13:</p>

<blockquote><div>We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.</div></blockquote>

<p>Nor are we saying that when we interpret the Bible we must interpret it woodenly, ignoring the differences between history, poetry, wisdom or the more philosophical writings. Nor are we saying that every verse of every book is of equal significance. Verses that list genealogies are obviously different, for example, to verses like Psalm 110 verse 1 - "The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet'." This is the Old Testament verse most often quoted, or alluded to, in the New Testament. Nor are we saying you can ignore the fact that in the Bible you have "cumulative" revelation. Hebrews 1 verses 1-2 say this:</p>

<blockquote><div>In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Four aspects of God's saving work</b><br><br>Nor are we saying that God does not reveal himself through actions and in history. Indeed, his "words" are only one part of his self-revelation as a saving God. There are at least four aspects to his saving work. <br><br>First, there is his work of acting redemptively in human history. The Bible says this began at the time of the Patriarchs and the Exodus from Egypt, but climaxed in Jesus' ministry, death and resurrection. However there were "words" both before and after the events as through prophets and apostles God warned about, prepared people for, and explained what he was, and is, doing. <br><br>Secondly, there is God's work of inspiring writers to record, celebrate and apply these actions and words. That is what you have in the Bible.<br><br>Thirdly, there is God's work in bringing to people's attention the message of the Bible. That is now done through messengers who proclaim or preach the truth of God's word which is there definitively for us in the Bible.<br><br>And fourthly, there is God's work in giving understanding to individuals when they read or hear God's truth preached so that they can then trust Christ as Saviour and Lord. Paul prays for this in Ephesians 1.17-19:</p>

<blockquote><div>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Jesus Christ the centre</b><br><br>But what then are we saying? We are saying as Article VI of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England says:</p>

<blockquote><div>Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation." </div></blockquote>

<p>And it is a book on salvation because supremely it is a book about Jesus Christ and has to be interpreted with him as its centre. The Old Testament points forward to Christ, even if not all the writers were fully aware that they were doing so and even if sometimes the pointing is indirect. The New Testament, of course, is explicit and direct about Jesus Christ both in what it records and how it explains his person and work. So the Old Testament or the Jewish Scriptures are certainly relevant to Christians. Paul writes to the Romans:</p>

<blockquote><div>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope" (Rom 15.4).</div></blockquote>

<p>And he writes to the Corinthians, referring to the Exodus wanderings:</p>

<blockquote><div>These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfilment of the ages has come" (1 Cor 10.11).</div></blockquote>

<p>Nor is this just some quirk of Paul. It was Jesus who on his Resurrection day appeared to two groups of disciples and explained how the Jewish Scriptures had been fulfilled in him. We read in Luke 24.25-27:</p>

<blockquote><div>He said to them: 'How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?' And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</div></blockquote>

<p>And we read in Luke 24.44-47</p>

<blockquote><div>He said to them, 'This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.' Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, 'This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The authority of the Bible</b><br><br>We are also saying this: there is a huge importance to getting our thinking right on the Bible. And this importance has to do with the issue of obedience - Christian obedience or practical Christian living.<br><br>Discussions about the Bible in the abstract can sound rather academic. But that is only until you go into the real world. As I was writing all this in late August I had to break off to be involved in a BBC Radio Newcastle discussion following Northumberland's decision no longer only to place children for adoption with married couples and single people: they would now consider people living together in "alternative life-styles".<br><br>But how do you decide about "alternative life-styles" - which in that discussion over adoption means sexual life-styles? Is it right to place children for adoption with homosexual couples or with cohabiting couples? I argue not only that such "life-styles" are not in the best interests of the child, but also that the Bible is crystal clear that homosexual activity is wrong as is all sexual activity outside marriage. However, the Church of England's Children's Society under its chairman, Jim Thompson, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, has decided against the Bible and is now committed to using homosexual parents.<br><br>This highlights the problem. And it is most acute when there are different views coming from people who all claim to be "Christian". Nor is this anything new. It happened in New Testament times. Jim Packer reminds us of the situations in Galatia and Colosse:</p>

<blockquote><div>Imagine the perplexity of the Galatian Christians the day they first had read to them the blistering sentences in which Paul goes after some who 'are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ' (Gal 1.7). 'As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!' (Gal 5.12). Imagine, too, how the Colossian Christians must have gulped when they first heard the words of Paul (whom they had never met) cutting down the teacher who was delighting in 'false humility and the worship of angels' and who was puffed up 'with idle notions' (Col 2.18). In each case Paul was squelching respected men whose teachings on faith and duty had hitherto been treated as true. Whom should they follow? Paul? Or their local pundits?</div></blockquote>

<p>So what do you do, as an ordinary Christian, when you find people claiming the name "Christian" but saying things that are quite opposite? How do you decide what, or who, is right? Who is to be the final arbiter or authority? There are three alternatives open to you.<br><br><br><b>Three alternatives</b><br><br>First, there is having the church as the final authority. Some people treat the consensus of the church as decisive. So they make church tradition the authoritative guide for determining the will of God. These people make the Bible subordinate to the church. They carefully study the Bible but by the light of church teaching and, critically, make the Bible fit in with church teaching, even when it clearly doesn't. This, we would argue, has happened with the Roman Catholic church. For such people what the church says, God's says. The work of the Holy Spirit is, according to this view, to make you submissive in an absolute way to church authority.<br><br>Secondly, there is making your own personal views decisive. This is when people do not mind if they decide against either the church or the Bible. They simply take the Bible and church teaching as material to be considered as they make up their own minds. They then will reject what they don't like and accept what they do. They become the final arbiters. They are judges over the Bible and the church. This is Canon Stanesby's position. For such people what their own reason or imagination suggests in response to the Bible or the historic teaching of the church is decisive. The Holy Spirit's work, they claim, is to help you pick and choose from the Bible and the church's tradition.<br><br>Thirdly, there is making the Bible decisive and the final authority. This was the position of Jesus. This is the official position of the Church of England. It sees the importance of the church and church tradition as well as reason; but these have to be subordinated to the Bible. So Article XX of the Thirty-nine Articles says:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies and authority in Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain anything that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.</div></blockquote>

<p>Here the Holy Spirit's role is to make you humble so that you are willing to learn from the Bible. You will submit both church ideas, and your own, to the judgment of the Bible. So with regard to homosexual adoption, because the Bible makes it clear that homosexual activity is wrong, that is sufficient for you as a Christian. Social science, actually, then confirms that ruling of the Bible. For God's rules are not capricious but according to the grain of his created order. You discover that in the best interests of the child children should only be placed with married couples or single people who will endorse the marriage ethic. Yes, it may be politically incorrect to say that sex outside heterosexual marriage is wrong. But what matters is the Bible's teaching, not the views of decadent social workers, TV producers, educationalists or other opinion-formers, nor the views of other churchmen who contradict the Bible. <br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>All these considerations show why Canon Stanesby was wrong and why we need to heed Psalm 119. Let me conclude with some words of John Wesley:</p>

<blockquote><div>I am a creature of a day ... I want to know one thing, the way to heaven ... God himself has condescended to teach the way ... He has written it down in a book. O give me that book: at any price give me the book of God! I have it: here is knowledge enough for me ... I sit down alone: only God is here. In his presence I open, I read his book: for this end, to find the way to heaven.</div></blockquote>

                <p><b>The World Trade Centre, New York</b><br><br>The Word Trade Centre in New York was not just the most conspicuous symbol of US capitalism. It was also intended to be a symbol of human unity and human greatness. Its architect, Minoura Yamasaki, said it should be ... "... a living representation of Man's belief in the co-operation of men, and through this, his ability to find greatness." <br><br>The towers were amazing with 12,000 miles of electric cabling, with 68 miles of steel used in their construction, with 43,600 windows and they could be seen from at least 20 miles away. They had stood for 30 years and were thought to be indestructible. <br><br>But as we now know, on 11 September 2001, at 7.45 am (US time) American Airlines Flight AA11 took off from Boston bound for Los Angeles with tanks full of fuel and with 81 passengers and 11 crew. At 8.10 am United Airlines Flight UA175 also took off from Boston. It too was bound for LA and had 65 people on board. At 8.45 am Flight AA11 was flown by Muslim extremists into one tower of the World Trade Centre; and at 9.03 am flight UA175, which was similarly hijacked, was flown into the other tower after swerving to cause maximum impact. <br><br>The rest is history, with another American Airlines plane being flown into the Pentagon in Washington and another United Airlines flight crashing in open country near Pittsburgh. The exact number of fatalities at the World Trade Centre is not yet clear. But at the time of writing there are believed to be in excess of 6000.<br><br><br><b>Babel</b><br><br>Several thousand years earlier, at the dawn of civilization, there was another disaster. This was in Mesopotamia. We are not told how or what precisely happened but just that it did happen. It too was at a time of progress and invention. Indeed, new building technologies had been invented. There was a project underway to build the tallest ziggurat in the world (a ziggurat being a Mesopotamian temple-tower). The account of what happened is given us in Genesis 11.3-4:<br><br>They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth." <br><br>Here, of course, is the same desire for human unity and human greatness. But the biblical analysis is that such a desire becomes demonic unless men and women share God's vision of unity and greatness. His vision is the very opposite, in may ways, of the world's vision. Greatness, Jesus said, comes from service, and unity is only and ultimately to be found in him. Greatness and power that ignore the ethical demands of God's law, and unity that is based on a philosophy that ignores God's claims, create a "Babylon". Babylon is the biblical example of, and then the biblical symbol for, a God-rejecting civilization, or State, that invariably becomes cruel and tyrannous in spite of all its initial glitz and aspirations. Ultimately it disintegrates. Nor is that just a theological judgment. It is a historical fact - witness Rome in the early Christian centuries and Nazi Germany, Stalinist USSR and Maoist China more recently. <br><br>The Bible (Genesis 11.5-9) in very simple terms describes the issues with Babel which is, of course, embryonic Babylon.</p>

<blockquote><div>But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other." So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel - because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The Tower of Siloam</b><br><br>How should we react to the terrible horror that took place last month in New York? Surely the first thing to do in such a situation is to show compassion. There are now thousands who are mourning the loss of loved ones. We know that families have been devastated; businesses have been crippled; and many Americans who have never experienced an attack on their own soil before live in fear. So we should pray for those who suffer to realize that there is a "God of all comfort" and that he can "comfort us in all our troubles" (2 Cor 1.3-4). When Jesus was in the town called Nain, we are told his "heart went out" to a widow whose son had just died (Luke 7.13). We can do no less in respect of those bereaved as a result of the New York disaster.<br><br>But then questions inevitably arise - and they have been asked about everything from the intelligence services, to the design of the World Trade Centre, to immigration policies, to Islam in general and the Qur'an in particular, to the nature of the jihad, to the nature of Islamic Fundamentalism, to the ambitions of Osama bin Laden, to the decadence of the West, to the glory of the West, to the just war, to the nature of justice, and to the pivotal significance of Saudi Arabia and Israel at the present time. None of these questions can be ignored. But we surely should begin our analysis with Jesus' guidelines for thinking about disaster situations.<br><br>On one occasion Jesus was told about a terrible massacre. Some Galilean pilgrims were brutally killed under the orders of the Roman governor, Pilate, while in the very act of sacrificing, presumably in the Temple. But Jesus didn't want people to draw the wrong conclusions. And in his teaching he linked this tragedy concerning the Galileans with another one, the fatal collapse of the Tower of Siloam. At the time the tower was a landmark within the south-east section of the wall of Jerusalem. This is Luke's account of the events and Jesus' words (13.1-5):<br><br>Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them - do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish."<br><br><br><b>Jerry Falwell</b><br><br>This is of very great importance. In simple terms it warns us against simplistic judgments and saying that the individuals caught up in disasters are being punished because they are "worse sinners" than other people. Jesus emphatically says they are not. His implication is that all are sinners. So that included his audience and the brutal Pilate. Today it includes all those asking questions as well as all the people who died and their brutal Islamic killers. But Jesus also implies that while you cannot argue that all suffering is due to sin, sin may well lead to suffering. So he tells the people he is talking with to repent.<br><br>In the light of that, what are we to think about Jerry Falwell, the outspoken American Baptist pastor and former Moral Majority leader? Jerry Falwell appeared on TV a day after the terrorist attack had occurred. He decided not to criticize Islamic Fundamentalism but to major on faults that he saw at home in America. He was arguing that the root problem was the so called "liberal" agenda - for example, the exclusion of God from public education and the scandal of abortion: "when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are trying to make that an alternative lifestyle ... all of them who have tried to secularize America ... I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen'."<br><br>This was not the right thing to say on a day when most of America was still in a state of shock. "There is a time to be silent and a time to speak" (Eccles. 3.7). He was universally excoriated. Even his fellow TV evangelist, Pat Robertson, insisted that Falwell apologize (which he did). But was Falwell totally wrong? He perhaps should have said where he himself had gone wrong, rather than just speak about others. When disasters occur, the implication of Jesus teaching is that we should question how we ourselves have been living. Have we admitted our guilt and where we have gone wrong. For none of us can stand in judgment on others. <br><br>But that doesn't mean we cannot make judgments at all. Asserting the truth and being proud have no necessary connection. It is undoubtedly wrong to assert the truth proudly or arrogantly. But it is also undoubtedly wrong not to assert the truth when that is necessary. And the truth undoubtedly is that many Muslims world wide hate America and the West because of its perceived moral degeneracy. To say that is not to deny the hypocrisy of many Muslims. But the breakdown of the family, the permissive sexual culture and not least the homosexualization of the West is simply anathema to many Muslims and not just to extremists. In that respect it could be said that those who had worked for the demoralization of America in the last half of the twentieth century - the sort of people Falwell had in mind - had "helped this happen". And to say that is not to deny the proper use of force to bring to justice those who committed these crimes against humanity and to prevent further crimes against humanity. It is to admit sociological reality.<br><br><br><b>John Rodgers</b><br><br>The moral and spiritual condition of the world can no longer be ignored. Why was it that on Tuesday 25 September at the Party Conference of the Liberal Democrats the debate over relaxing the already lax censorship laws and giving encouragement to pornography was cancelled? If pornography is a good thing, why hold back because of the deaths of several thousand people? Is it because moral sanity is beginning to surface and people are realizing that there must be a limit to decadence? <br><br>That we need to view the current situation from a moral and spiritual perspective was brought home to me at the very moment the attacks were happening. I was sitting at my desk reading an e-mail from my good friend Bishop John Rodgers who preached at Jesmond last Autumn and who is one of the bishops working in AMiA (the American Mission in America). AMiA is a group of US Episcopalians who are resisting the theologically liberalizing drift in US Anglicanism with its disregard for the Bible and with its fixation on legitimizing homosexual sex and the ordaining of active homosexual clergy. The e-mail contained the report by a well-known US journalist about a homosexually abused Franciscan Friar who had recently committed suicide. He was a novice Friar and had been abused by one of the seniors of his order for almost a year "in the 'shiatsu' massage room of the friary at Long Island, the New York house of the Episcopal Society of St Francis." This resulted in severe depression and eventually suicide. According to his mother, </p>

<blockquote><div>James [the young man] never recovered from the sexual abuse he received at the hands of the brothers at the Society of St Francis on Long Island. Despite all the counselling he remained depressed because he never got the justice he deserved. The Episcopal Church just buried the whole thing hoping it would go away. Furthermore the Episcopal Church's stance on homosexuality makes it impossible to condemn the behaviour even though it killed my son who was not a homosexual." </div></blockquote>

<p>The account of this case is horrific and implicated bishops right to the top of the Episcopal Church. The mother's final comment was:</p>

<blockquote><div>I hope his death is a wake up call for right thinking Episcopalians everywhere that homosexual behaviour, in fact any kind of sexual behaviour outside of heterosexual marriage, can cost you your life.</div></blockquote>

<p>I had just read that sentence and was thinking, quite literally, "what will bring conviction and sense to the many in the church (in the UK as well as the US) who are in total defiance of God's laws?" when the phone rang. It was my daughter phoning from America. She wanted me to know what was going on. It was just after 2.00 pm (UK time) so just after the attacks had occured. I immediately switched on my TV and saw the unfolding tragedy. <br><br>That was certainly one of those coincidences that make you think. But will this be seen as "a wake up call" in any way? Some people seem to be saying it might be.<br><br><br><b>A New Era</b><br><br>Two commentators at opposite ends of the political spectrum think that we are facing the end of liberalism (or as it should be more corrrectly called "libertarianism"). On the one hand there is Christine Odone. She is the deputy editor of the New Statesman and writing in the Observer on Sunday 30 September she argued, referring to the attacks, that ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... with a flourish of their knives, bin Laden and his disciples killed off the optimistic mindset that intellectuals and many among the middle class have subscribed to for the past two centuries ... They [the middle class intellectuals] seem unable to accept or even understand the contempt with which their creed is viewed by these strange men. They seem incapable of recognising that all along there was another vision, another set of values, that were taking shape ... Human nature, alas, is not always satisfied by an increase in salary or access to the internet. There are many people out there who long for far grander rewards, and who yearn for an ideology that claims to have the ultimate authority. For these people, anything else is banal and they will not be short-changed by some prosaic plea that, surely, we are all doing okay aren't we? Now that their sweet-natured mantra (reason is all we need to guide us, happiness in this world is all we need to aspire to) has been torched by the Taliban, what will liberals do?</div></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand there is Paul Johnson who wrote the Saturday Essay in the Daily Mail on 15 September 2001. His piece was headed "Dawn of a New Age" and the sub-heading was "this week has signalled the death of liberalism. No longer will the West tolerate people and cultures that undermine its safety. We will see a new morality being born." And he asks: "Is the 21st century about to become the Age of Reaction, when the clock was put firmly back to severity, discipline and the implacable enforcement of the law?" He argues, "Yes!" and America will lead the way.<br><br>"Nor will the change of mood and direction be confined to combating terrorism. Just as, in the 20th century, liberal notions took over every aspect of our own society - from sex and the media to crime and punishment, from marriage and family life and the relations of parents to children to the replacement of traditional notions of duty by the pursuit of universal rights - so the reaction to the discredited values will spread gradually, but with growing speed, to every corner of our own permissive societies. It will affect such issues as divorce, abortion and illegitimacy, the nature of education, the conduct of universities, the upbringing of youth, the direction of scholarship and, not least, the future of religion and the fundamental dictates of morality ... Thus the French Revolutionary Terror of the 1790's shocked the world, led to a religious revival, and culminated in a recovery of values which produced the certitudes of the Victorian age.<br><br><br><b>Samuel Huntington</b><br><br>For a long time I have been persuaded by the thesis of Samuel Huntington in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. Henry Kissinger calls this "one of the most important books to have emerged since the end of the Cold War". Huntington's view is that world affairs in the nineteenth century were chiefly determined by the nation-state, and in the twentieth century by ideology (e.g. Marxism and National Socialism), but in the twenty-first century they will be dominated by religion - by the conflict of civilizations, with civilizations being defined by cultures and cultures defined by religion. The collapse of Communism, according to Huntington, does not therefore point to a simple world-wide embrace of democratic capitalism and Western values and vices. Rather, he sees an era of conflict that will be deep seated and endemic. If this is true, the West will be at a great disadvantage, with its Christian culture having disintegrated under an elitist imposition of a non-cohesive relativism and pluralism. "Peoples and countries with similar cultures are coming together," writes Huntington. "Peoples and countries with different cultures are coming apart." If this is true and religion is at the heart of culture, religion will increasingly be a central, perhaps the central, force that motivates and mobilizes people.<br><br>Whether Huntington is right or not, it is quite clear that millions around the world are being motivated by religion. As Christians we can understand such a motivation. Therefore the ultimate solution to the current world situation can never be force - force can and must be used to ensure justice and to protect States. But you can never bomb people into changing their minds and hearts. If the root problem with Islam is a wrong understanding of the nature of God and his will, evangelism is the only answer. What is needed is not the power of cruise missiles but the power of the gospel. But in seeking to win Muslims to Christ we must show them much respect at the same time as we must, in all honesty, profoundly disagree with them. <br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>We must be tolerant both of people of other faiths and of secularists. But we must understand that toleration is not indifference. Toleration implies disagreement. You can only tolerate those you disagree with, but you grant them freedom to hold their views. If you believe they are profoundly wrong, out of simple human concern, let alone Christian love, you will try to help them come to a right belief. But there can be no enforcing of belief. We must pray and, as we can, speak and then trust God. With people of other faiths we need to learn from Paul at Athens: "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious ... [But] what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you" (Acts 17.22-23). With Western secularists it is often conceptually much harder. Perhaps, following 11 September 2001, things will become easier.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Autumn Christian Institute Lecture">(November 2001) Autumn Christian Institute Lecture</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>November 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Sixteen years ago, on 25 October 1985 this obituary was recorded in The Times newspaper. It was the obituary on Raymond Johnston. It read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Mr Raymond Johnston, the director of CARE Trust (formerly the Nationwide Festival of Light), died after a short illness on October 17. He was 58. Following the formation of the Nationwide Festival of Light, he became its first director in 1974. The NFOL was essentially a Christian grass roots movement of protest against certain changes in sexual and social morality that began in the 1960s. As director, he gave intellectual and political weight to a movement that had quiet but considerable influence. Much of his time was spent in research, writing, briefings, and coordination of campaigns. His submissions and responses to Home Office or DHSS committees inquiring into matters of moral and ethical concern were always models of careful argument and clarity. In the last year of his life he had been campaigning for the protection of the human embryo in the light of the Warnock Report. As a strong Evangelical Anglican he was convinced that a strong family structure was essential for a healthy society. His 1978 London Lectures in Contemporary Christianity 'Who Needs the Family?' spelt this out and show how all his thinking was deeply rooted in a biblical Christian faith. Raymond Johnston was born on April 4, 1927. After Solihull School, The Queen's College, Oxford (where he read modern languages), and studying theology at the London Bible College, he taught modern languages in schools in Kent and Sheffield. From 1964 to 1974 he was a lecturer in the Department of Education at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. While at Newcastle, he began his involvement in the central affairs of the Church of England. A churchwarden of Jesmond parish church, he was elected from the diocese of Newcastle to the Church Assembly (now the General Synod) from 1965 to 1970. After leaving Newcastle in 1974 to become director of the Nationwide Festival of Light, he was returned to the House of Laity of the General Synod as a member for Oxford from 1980 to 1985 … His speeches in Synod debates were always respected for their honesty and candidness. He is survived by his wife, Peggy, and their two daughters. </div></blockquote>

<p>I actually wrote that obituary, having known Raymond personally since 1972. That was when I was interviewed for the post of vicar of Jesmond. At the time he was one of the two churchwardens at JPC (Jesmond Parish Church). Humanly speaking, he was one of the reasons why I am here tonight in Newcastle and giving this lecture!<br><br>This evening I simply want to say, by way of introduction, something briefly about Raymond the man. Then I went to spend most of my time on Raymond's beliefs and concerns.<br><br>At the memorial service for Raymond Johnston – we at Jesmond, by the way, knew him and referred to him by his initials, "O R J" – at his memorial service Jim Packer (Dr J.I.Packer) who was a life-long, or more precisely since-student-days friend, described Raymond Johnston as "one of God's Barnabas's". Dr Packer was referring to Acts 11.23-24 and Barnabas' visit to Antioch where we read:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>… he [Barnabas] was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith.</div></blockquote>

<p>And Raymond was constantly "encouraging" people "to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts". He was "a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith."<br><br>But Raymond was not stuffy. He had a great sense of humour. In his book Caring and Campaigning he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>A Christian who has no sense of humour should pray for one! And those who rejoice in such a gift should pray that the Lord will help them to use it to good advantage.</div></blockquote>

<p>Raymond was a man of wide sympathies and interests. He was a lover of the arts. In that respect he was a genuine Christian humanist in the tradition of C.S.Lewis who he greatly respected. He loved music. He was on the board of the Northern Symphonia and was instrumental he getting Christopher Seaman as the conductor after the departure of Rudolph Schwartz. He loved good painting, good architecture and good broadcasting. That inevitably made him oppose all that was bad and demeaning in the arts. Indeed, he not only campaigned against pornography. He also opposed some of the monstrosities – for example, tower blocks – that came to desecrate our cities in the 60s and 70s. He helped in my early days at Jesmond with our opposition to the more Philistine aspects of the construction of the Central Motorway East. <br><br>And Raymond was concerned for the whole person. He was not just someone who saw people as "spiritual" and so merely targets for evangelism. No! He was a great "scouter". Yes, he used his scouting as an opportunity for Christian witness and teaching but not in any exploitative way. It is probably due to Raymond Johnston that scouts [and guides and all the other groups] have continued to this day as effective groups at JPC. Nor must we forget his loyal support of Newcastle United Football Club. There was Raymond on most Saturdays (if there was a home game) exercising his lungs in support of the "Toon", in the days, of course, of "Super-Mac" – Malcolm Macdonald rather than of Kevin Keagan or of Alan Shearer. My memories of Raymond's exploits as a fan include an occasion in the early seventies when soccer was beginning to turn "nasty" in terms of "terrace behaviour". I switched on the early evening TV news to get the final score of, I think, Newcastle at home to Nottingham Forrest. What should I see but headline news relating to that very match for there had been a pitch invasion - something quite unknown in those days. Inevitably there was condemnation of this hooligan behaviour. But who should be filmed in the fore-front of the spectators running along the pitch but ORJ – Raymond Johnston. It was hilarious, seeing the middle-aged future director of the Nationwide Festival of Light, the champion of discipline in schools, as large as life running with all the yobs! The truth, of course, was, as I found out when I teased him in church the next day, that fighting had broken out in his stand; so people like himself sitting or standing near the front were forced onto the pitch by the physical force of the crowd pressure from behind.<br><br>In the same way as he "theologised" (and fairly) his love of humour, he "sociologised" (equally fairly) his loyalty to Newcastle United:<br><br>It is worth remarking [he wrote] how the need for local allegiances, which is denied by the dreary monochrome of so much of our standardized existence in modern bureaucratic industrial society, is today expressed in the colourful world of sport, and particularly of supporters' clubs. To be a football "fan", for example, may in one sense be part of discovering one's local identity… We all need to know where we belong in space and time.<br><br>So much for Raymond the man. I now want to turn to his beliefs and concerns. And I want to draw attention to three aspects of these that, I believe, are still vital for today. So I have three headings or propositions. <b><i>First</i>, RAYMOND JOHNSTON WAS ROOTED IN THE BIBLE AND THE 16TH CENTURY REFORMERS</b>; <b><i>secondly</i>, RAYMOND JOHNSTON FOCUSED ON CULTURAL DISINTEGRATION</b>; and, <b><i>thirdly</i>, RAYMOND JOHNSTON CALLED FOR CHRISTIAN THINKING AND ACTION.</b><br><br><br><b><i>First</i>, RAYMOND JOHNSTON WAS ROOTED IN THE BIBLE AND THE 16TH CENTURY REFORMERS</b><br><br>Raymond Johnston came to faith through the ministry of Dick True and the other leaders at the Solihull Crusader Class. It was there that he received his basic Christian nurture. That gave Raymond his understanding of the supreme authority of the Bible. Raymond was, indeed, a Biblical Christian. He wanted to know what Jesus and the Apostles taught, not what the latest speculations of some eccentric religious guru might be.<br><br>But Raymond did not just accept the authority of the Bible and leave open how it should be interpreted. No! He believed in "the perspicuity of the Scripture". You don't need the Church or independent human reason to unlock the Bible. Yes, they can help. But the basic content of the Bible is clear enough. This was a fundamental tenet of the Reformation and Raymond followed that Reformed understanding. Here is how Martin Luther expresses it:<br><br>I certainly grant that many passages in the Scripture are obscure and hard to elucidate, but that is due, not to the exalted nature of their subject, but to our own linguistic and grammatical ignorance; and it does not in any way prevent our knowing all the contents of Scripture.<br><br>And Luther goes on:</p>

<blockquote><div>The perspicuity of Scripture is twofold … The first is external, and relates to the ministry of the Word; the second concerns the knowledge of the heart. If you speak of internal perspicuity, the truth is that nobody who has not the Spirit of God sees a jot of what is in the Scriptures. All men have their hearts darkened, so that, even when they can discuss and quote all that is in Scripture, they do not understand or really know any of it … the Spirit is needed for the understanding of all Scripture and every part of Scripture. If on the other hand you speak of external perspicuity, the position is that nothing whatsoever is left obscure or ambiguous, but all that is in the Scripture is through the Word brought forth into the clearest light and proclaimed to the whole word.</div></blockquote>

<p>Now, I have given you that extended quotation because it comes from the first book that Raymond Johnston was responsible for – a translation of Luther's The Bondage of the Will, which he jointly translated with Jim Packer and for which together with Jim Packer he wrote the very helpful introduction. This claimed that The Bondage of the Will is "the greatest piece of writing that came from Luther's pen." The book makes Raymond's own theology so clear as it makes so clear what was at the heart of the Reformation – namely the sovereignty and grace of God on the one hand and the sinfulness of men and women on the other hand. That sinfulness had so "bound the human will" that human beings were helpless in doing anything to save themselves. Unless God stepped in to empower them, they were without hope. But the gospel is that God has stepped in in Christ on the cross and through the Holy Spirit who opens blind eyes and generates faith. This issue of the "bondage of the will" Luther claimed was "the hinge on which all turns." <br><br>But how did this Reformed thinking come out in Raymond's own basic theology? He gives us a good summary of the issues, not long before he died, in his little book Nationhood: towards a Christian Perspective:<br><br>Every Protestant Confession asserts the sovereign control of God in providence over every event in time, in accordance with the teaching of the Old Testament prophets, of our Lord himself (eg Matthew 10.29 – "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father") and of the New Testament epistles (eg Ephesians 1.11 – "In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will"). The Christian is meant to live with confidence in the hand of God, who sustains and governs all things, rather than as a prey to the message of meaninglessness so prevalent today, or to any version of the juggernaut evolutionary theory. God sustains and rules.<br><br>Sustaining is more than maintaining – it is rather an active grip which holds everything together (Col 1.17 – "He [Jesus Christ] is before all things, and in him all things hold together"), an energizing upholding (Heb 1.3 – "The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word") without which all things would disintegrate into unimagined chaos and darkness … [It is] God's active rule or government. Nations exist by and under his providential sustaining power … but they also emerge, develop and fall according to his sovereign purpose.<br><br>Neither in the case of individuals nor in the case of nations does providence rule out responsibility. Men and communities are held accountable for their rebellion against the law written in their own hearts, idolatry, violence and other forms of wickedness. [Yes] evil is woven into the divine plan and can mysteriously be turned to good, as supremely in the death of Jesus, boldly announced by the apostles as bringing both deadly guilt and a glorious salvation (Acts 2.23; 3.15; 4.28).<br><br>Raymond Johnston believed that the 16th century Reformers needed to be rediscovered. After all they themselves were only rediscovering apostolic Christianity. And Raymond Johnston not only believed, he acted. Jim Packer tells us how:<br><br>Raymond went to the IVF General Conference at Swanick [when he and Raymond were students together at Oxford in the late 40s] and came back raving about the speaker he heard there named Lloyd Jones. Also he discovered for himself the writings of Bishop J C Ryle and through Ryle the seventeenth century Puritan writers. Then he introduced me to them – that's something for which I can never thank him enough. Incidentally it was Raymond who first thought of holding an annual Puritan Studies Conference in London and who in 1949 took me to meet Dr Lloyd Jones whom I didn't know at that time, so that we might enlist his help. That too, seems to me in retrospect, to have been a momentous action on Raymond's part.<br><br>Now it was because Raymond was a "Reformation man" that he saw no dichotomy between his Christian faith and social concern. The doctrine of the Sovereignty of God means that God is concerned for the whole of life, not just life on Sundays in church but Monday to Saturday out in the world as well. He believed that God was creator as well as redeemer; and he believed this created world couldn't be neglected even though our attitude towards it must always be in the light of heaven and eternity. He believed that God had created man in his own image, and that although that image was distorted by sin, it hadn't been destroyed. He, therefore, believed in the sanctity of human life. Believing also that "the archetypal transgression was murder" as evidenced in the sin of Cain, he naturally campaigned against attacks on human life. And the great attack since 1967 he saw coming through abortion, that huge blot on the moral landscape. <br><br>Let me give you Raymond's reasoning on this subject in some detail as it is still something to be fought and campaigned against. I quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>The question that is raised is: is it, or is it not, murder? It is true that the Bible never mentions deliberate induced abortion, so there is no explicit ruling on the matter. Nevertheless, by the end of the first century, one of the Christian ethical distinctives was already that Christians did not practise abortion. The Didache, an early manual of moral teaching and guide to conduct, was probably written before some of the latest epistles in the New Testament: it is against abortion. A prohibition against abortion was among the … canons of the Council of Elvira (c AD 306).By the end of the second century, the influence of Christianity had brought Roman law to forbid abortion, long before the conversion of Constantine and the Christianizing of the Roman Empire. Long before that, under the Emperor Severus, Roman law forbade abortion. This was the influence of Christianity over a hundred and fifty years. And the medical profession has never wavered over the last two thousand years – until our own lifetime … In Britain, for centuries a pregnant woman convicted of a capital offence could not be hanged – because she was bearing another life …The key question [then] is this: is the unborn child (for me as a Christian and equally as a member of the human race) entitled to my brotherly, neighbourly protection? Is it entitled to the same protection I would seek to give to a person I saw being attacked in the street? Is the unborn child my neighbour – or not?</div></blockquote>

<p>Raymond Johnston offers five considerations to help us answer that question.<br><br>First, ignorance points only one way. If our answer is "I do not know", or if I hold that there must be a point between conception and childbirth when the child becomes worthy of my protection but that I do not know when that point is – in either of these cases of ignorance, it must follow that we have to protect the child from the moment of conception onwards, because you could not accept ignorance as a morally valid defence in any comparable case.<br><br>Consider the case of a man lying in the street, having been run over or knocked down. You would not say, "I wonder if he is dead or not? I do not know. So I'll leave him, I won't try to save his life, I won't even call the ambulance." On the contrary, you would say that because you did not know, you would go straight to that man's aid and help him as much as you could … [similarly] I begin my protection of that child from the moment of conception, simply because I do not know, and because otherwise I could be making a terrible mistake.<br><br>Secondly, human life is genetically complete at conception.<br><br>Admittedly, at the beginning you did not look much like a human being, though we now know that after a few weeks in the womb, you did. In any case, the fact that a person does not look like a human being is not an argument for not protecting him. If you are a doctor called to a major disaster, you do not discuss whether somebody looks enough like a human being before being treated. You just give the treatment …<br><br>Thirdly, no criterion of "full humanity" will justify induced abortion. There is no point at which you can say that you are fully human …<br><br>Fourthly, human life is a continuum in which birth is only one event. What is natural birth today could have been induced childbirth yesterday … Indeed, the baby born by natural birth today could have been delivered by caesarean section a month ago…<br><br>Fifthly, the teaching of Scripture. When we look to the Bible for guidance on this subject we find that the biblical writers are conscious of God's hand upon them long before birth. Think of the birth stories that go back long before conception: how many individuals – such as Samuel, Samson, Jacob and Esau and Jeremiah – were either called by God, or were spoken of in advance, long before the moment of their natural birth. This does not make the case unanswerable, but it is an important factor …<br><br>But what does, in my opinion, conclusively resolve the issue is the use of the Greek word brephos in Luke 1.41. It means "the child". "The child leaped in her womb" – it is the same word as is used for a child after birth. And, more than leaping in her womb, the child apparently was filled with the Holy Spirit. Elizabeth spoke of the pregnant Mary as the "mother of my Lord".<br><br>This brings us therefore to the Christian affirmation of the incarnation, which leaves us no room for escape at all. If you are an orthodox, well-taught Christian who is asked, "When did God become man?" you will respond with the Apostles' Creed: "conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary". That is when he became man [at conception].<br><br>But if that is true, then manhood [or human existence] begins at conception. And if the proper man – that is, Jesus – began his earthly existence as a human being at conception, then so do all human beings. It is inescapable.<br><br>Raymond's desperate concern over abortion was ultimately from his understanding that God has created men and women in his own image.<br><br>But Raymond's Reformed instincts also meant that he was not only concerned with the individual. He was also concerned with those social groups that God had ordained either at creation or as part of his providential ordering of the world – in particular the State and the Family with married parents.<br><br>And Raymond's Reformed instincts meant that he was concerned for the preaching and teaching of the law as well as the gospel. He knew that without the law there was no gospel. If people did not know they were guilty before God, why would they want a Saviour - except as an add-on to make life more comfortable? He believed that the Reformers had got it right when they spoke about the law's "threefold function":<br><br>Firstly, it restrained sin and preserved order; secondly, it brought home to a man that he was personally responsible for his conduct, and above all, to God, and thus created conviction of sin, and, thirdly, it guided the Christian in his conduct.<br><br>And the law was supremely summed up in the Ten Commandments:<br><br>The Decalogue (the ten commandments) represents the permanent and universal decrees of the Sovereign Creator for mankind<br><br>And Raymond knew that God had written the law in two places, not only on tablets of stone, but also as Paul says in Romans in the human heart. And God's moral law is not an "alien intrusion but there is a fundamental correspondence between God's moral law and our human being" (to quote John Stott). In simpler terms, God's law is "the maker's instructions". So when we obey it, we are working with the grain of the created order. Because that is so, there is a general awareness of a basic moral law or "natural law". Therefore, in moral campaigns you can have alliances with people who may not as yet be believers, but who are aware of God's moral law, given by God's common grace (not his saving grace) and given through general revelation (not special revelation – in the Bible).<br><br>So Raymond Johnston was rooted in the bible and the 16th century reformers<br><br><br><b><i>Secondly</i>, RAYMOND JOHNSTON FOCUSED ON CULTURAL DISINTEGRATION</b> <br><br>In his thinking on the wider issues of the state and society, Raymond was absolutely convinced that what you believe does have social consequences.<br><br>A moral vision is needed to inspire a people to give them coherence and identity and purpose … Some – in particular, many of the Eastern religions – cherish the distant possibility of merging with the Infinite. In the West, we have looked for centuries at the picture of a man dying on a cross, giving himself for his fellow men … These visions which shape moral beliefs are very different in different societies. But because they determine what we think about the purpose of life, they have tremendous inspirational power.<br><br>And of relevance for this time particularly, Autumn 2001, Raymond has some observations on Islam. In his book Who Needs the Family he is writing about Fatherhood. He then says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>There is … a religious "skew" latent in Judaism itself and fully developed in Islam. This is the blazing, oppressive, dynamic, ultra-masculine character of Allah – the one true God to the Muslim. Springing from a Near Eastern and Jewish environment, but rejecting the deity of Christ and the Trinitarian nature of God, the Prophet proclaimed a God characterized by a crushing sense of "otherness". In contemplating this God we are overwhelmed by a consciousness of undifferentiated power which swallows up the truly personal, relational aspect known to Christians when they speak of God as Father. The spread of this Unitarian ethical monotheism is an impressive cultural achievement. But the ninety-nine attributes and names of Allah do not include love, and the impenetrable unity of the nature of the divine Being demands only submission – a fatalistic acceptance of all events, as man bows before the incomprehensible. This dominant theocratic creed can be seen as hyper-masculinity projected into the image of God – a new idolatry once more. And it is not surprising therefore to find that in countries where Islam's teaching has deeply influenced the laws and conventions, the status of woman is very low. Professor Anderson indeed has spoken of the "degradation of Muslim womanhood." Nor are we surprised to discover in Islam's teaching the doctrine of the Jihad or holy war – another manifestation of religiously sanctioned ultra-aggressiveness …</div></blockquote>

<p>Raymond Johnston was fully aware that the Christian needed not just to be concerned with "politics" when he or she focused on the wider world. He knew that the Public Square was bigger than Parliament Square. He saw the vital need to come to terms with the whole issue of "culture". But what is culture? He offered this as a definition:</p>

<blockquote><div>[Culture is] a persisting pattern of thinking, feeling, believing and evaluating, socially acquired by learning as distinct from biologically inherited, through which the cumulative heritage and value systems of a society are transmitted, and by virtue of which both individual meanings and social institutions cohere and continue.</div></blockquote>

<p>Obviously, then, a culture can be according to God's Word, against God's word, neutral or mixed. And obviously cultures can be in various states of moral health. Raymond's contention was that we in the West are now living in a "collapsing culture". He argued that there "has been the decline of shared moral and spiritual convictions". So he asked the question: "What is our Christian duty in this situation?"<br><br>Now Raymond was very aware of the dangers of the so-called "social gospel":</p>

<blockquote><div>At the very deepest level Christian testimony in any age is always the same. Take 1 John 1. Christian testimony asserts the facts that God is Light and that no man can say he is not a sinner; that the eternal Word of Life was with the Father from all eternity yet has become incarnate; that through the blood of Jesus Christ men and women can now be cleansed from sin, since God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and that when he forgives us we begin to enjoy fellowship with him, with his Son and with each other, and we experience great joy. These things are part of the unalterable Good News and we find them all in that one seminal chapter.</div></blockquote>

<p>But he went on to make the following points:</p>

<blockquote><div>Yet if this is all we "see" in Holy Scripture and in church history, we fall somewhat short of the whole counsel of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>The Bible has a lot to teach about social and cultural life. And faithfulness to the Bible in these matters does change societies and cultures:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is not simply that there are converts and heaven rejoices with the church as she grows [he wrote]. When the gospel prospers something else is given to a nation besides individual believers. The whole quality of social life is changed as more and more people apply the Word of God to their own life in the community. In this respect many of us are glad to point out to our doubting friends that seventeenth century England was in many ways a better society after the Reformers and the Puritans, eighteenth century England a healthier place thanks to Whitfield and Wesley, nineteenth century England ennobled by the work of Spurgeon and the others.</div></blockquote>

<p>But his desperate concern was over what he saw as cultural collapse. And the culture he saw collapsing was our own Western culture with its threefold roots in …</p>

<blockquote><div>… [first] the questioning of the Greeks; [secondly] the organization and sense of law of the Romans, and thirdly (and most important) the Judaeo-Christian religious and moral contribution. This last influence has been the deepest formative principle in the development of Western European culture. It was this that brought us the dignity of woman, the sacredness of the family, the intellectual base for the rise of modern science, our hospitals, our schools, our universities and – if we are to believe even some of the non-Christian economists – our great economic take-off after the Reformation.</div></blockquote>

<p>And what is a primary course of this collapse? Raymond was clear in his own mind:</p>

<blockquote><div>The most radical fault dates back a century – it is the lack of the fire and the vision of the gospel. Christianity in Britain has experienced a disastrous decline in the preaching and teaching of the Word of God. The church is weak, and the prevalent religious liberalism prevents her from preaching and expounding God's law. Without the law there is no understanding of the urgency and the glory of the New Testament gospel ..</div></blockquote>

<p>Nor is this claim that our culture is collapsing just some subjective judgment on the part of super-sensitive people:</p>

<blockquote><div>This disintegration [says Raymond Johnston] can be evaluated by the Christian in a number of ways. Take Leviticus 18, which is part of the Mosaic legislation. It is a frightening study to go through that chapter and ask "How is this word of God judging our culture today?" Those things prohibited to the Israelites as abominations, things which were not even to be named or considered amongst them are all back with us … The chapter goes on to mention homosexuality, behaviour which is now openly propagated in magazines, and approved or at least tolerated by an increasing group of men in a number of churches … Leviticus goes on to forbid sexual intercourse between humans and animals – things which can now be seen on the cinema screen in New York and Denmark and can be found in magazines available in this country. These are the enormities that are with us, every one of them forbidden in that one chapter … They pollute the whole community and the very region where they are prevalent – "the land is defiled" (v 25) </div></blockquote>

<p>… Any man of God with his Bible open will view with the utmost seriousness the eighteenth and nineteenth chapters of Genesis, which record the destruction of Sodom. He will also note that the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans condemns the sin of sodomy in a particular terrifying way. We are not speaking here of tendencies or temptations … What Scripture condemns is the deliberate satisfaction of homosexual desire in forbidden behaviour – sodomy … Homosexual indulgence is something which God condemns as the ultimate sign of decadence and degradation in any culture. <br><br>So how are we to respond.<br><br><br><b><i>Thirdly</i>, RAYMOND JOHNSTON CALLED FOR THINKING AND ACTION.</b><br><br>Raymond Johnston went back to the sack of Rome as having something to teach us today:</p>

<blockquote><div>I have always been very moved by these words which I read in a church history book: "on the 24th August in the Year of the City 1164, and in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ 410, the Goths under Alaric entered and sacked Rome. 'My voice sticks in my throat,' says Jerome, 'and sobs choke me as I dictate. The city which took the whole world captive is itself taken.' Jerome uttered the sensations of all, both Christian and heathen. There has been no such shock to Europe since." So wrote Charles Williams in The Descent of the Dove. (We do well to remember that the last sentence was written in 1939 before we opened the doors of Belsen, Dachau and Buchenwald). The sack of Rome sent a tremor throughout Christianity; Jerome's words show a Christian feeling deeply the collapse of a culture.</div></blockquote>

<p>So the first response of a Christian is to show compassion at such at time<br><br>As a culture collapses people get hurt. If my love for my neighbour means anything to me at all, the fact that my neighbour and my neighbour's children are now open to subtle forms of media-controlled, psychologically-dominated poison must surely make me feel sorrow and compassion for them.<br><br>Nor was Raymond Johnston concerned just to quote texts and be prophetic. He was also concerned to argue and use anthropology and sociology to confirm God's truth.<br><br>Take for example the issues of sex and marriage. Raymond was concerned to make public the findings of what had happened in the 1920s in Soviet Russia when the Leninists attempted to abolish family ties completely and when, [I quote] …</p>

<blockquote><div>… marriage became civil registration only, and that in a most undignified and hole-in-corner way. Divorce became possible by simple declaration. Incest, bigamy and adultery ceased to be criminal offences. Abortion on request was made possible without the necessity even to declare a reason, and a little later the labour laws made it obligatory for people to accept any post imposed on them, wherever that job might be. No modification was conceded even in the case of a husband posted away from his wife, or a wife sent to employment away from her husband. As a result of these policies family ties were weaker by 1930. But other effects were also noticed. By 1935 it was clear that the nation had been enfeebled and that it could not call upon such strong and widespread popular allegiance in the case of a possible war. The specific results of the anti-family policy were serious. Free divorce and abortion had pushed down the birth rate. In 1934 in the hospitals of Moscow there were 53,000 births and 154,000 abortions. Juvenile delinquency, violence in schools, vandalism, sadistic behaviour by quite young children – all these things had spread … [So] from 1935 onwards the process was put in reverse … Marriage became desirable and children were taught from their earliest years that it was a serious matter, a commitment for life. One article records an interesting sign: in 1936 wedding rings re-appeared in the shops of Moscow</div></blockquote>

<p>He also wanted to make public the findings of the anthropologist, J.D.Unwin. Unwin wrote a massive book in 1934 entitled Sex and Culture:<br><br>Unwin [Raymond tells us] describes his investigation as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>When I started these researches I sought to establish nothing, and had no idea of what the result would be. With care-free open-mindedness I decided to test, by a reference to human records, a somewhat startling conjecture that had been made by the analytical psychologists. This suggestion was that if the social regulations forbid direct satisfaction of the sexual impulses the emotional conflict is expressed in another way, and that what we call "civilization" has always been built up by compulsory sacrifices in the gratification of innate desires.Unwin selected only societies for which sufficient evidence could be found (a) of sexual regulation and (b) of what he calls "cultural energy". This latter he defined as a process perceived as tending towards questioning, exploring and conquering. His studies covered eighty primitive societies and sixteen civilized societies and his two general conclusions were as follows:The cultural condition of any society in any geographical environment is conditioned by its past and present methods of regulating the relations between the sexes. No society can display productive social energy unless a new generation inherits a social system under which sexual opportunity is reduced to a minimum. The Western Christian norm received [says Raymond Johnston] startling support from this research. The greatest energy, Unwin comments, has been displayed only by those societies which have reduced their sexual opportunity to a minimum by the adoption of absolute monogamy.… [Unwin] concluded that the evidence pointed towards a choice: either cultural energy and achievement, or sexual licence. It is impossible for any society to enjoy both for more than one generation. Aldous Huxley examined Unwin's evidence in his book Ends and Means (1965), as did Dr David Mace, and both found his evidence compelling. The way in which Unwin's work has been almost completely ignored by both scholars and popular writers sometimes seems positively sinister.</div></blockquote>

<p>So concludes Raymond Johnston.<br><br>Now, in responding to the problems relating to cultural and social life he knew that he had to fight not only opponents in the world, but also opponents in the church who were wrongly "pietistic".<br><br>But Raymond Johnston was adamant. Jesus prayed not that his disciples would be taken out of the world but that they would be protected from the evil one (John 17.15). So we must avoid what he called "Christian insulation":<br><br>The desire to be a hermit or to enter the monastery [he said] is not one which belongs solely to the Roman tradition.<br><br>Indeed, Raymond's biblical heroes were Joseph and Daniel – men who remained faithful while at the heart of public life.<br><br>We need, therefore, to revive the concept of "Christian citizenship" which, he claimed, "has almost died over the last hundred years."<br><br>It was there in Victorian England, particularly towards the beginning of the century. Yet in the second half of the nineteenth century it gradually died. It must be revived. Here is an urgent teaching ministry for today, if ever there was one. We can approach this on the lowest level possible first, that of sheer opportunity. We live in a democracy, which means that every man's and woman's voice counts. We have a vote locally and a vote nationally. We can write letters which have a chance of being printed, we can make ourselves heard in all sorts of ways … Are we not under a clear obligation to participate and to use our voice for the standards which we know God has revealed?<br><br>His argument was simple. If "God is concerned with guiding nations", so must we be. If God has made us stewards of the created order, we must exercise that stewardship. If God has revealed to his people the truth about social righteousness, they must pass that revelation on. If they are to be salt and light in the world, so be it. And he wrote this:<br><br>We are commanded by the Apostle Paul to pray for good government (1 Timothy 1.2-4). How could we conceive that God would ask all his people to pray for something, and then respond by saying that of course the answer can only come through the ungodly!<br><br>No! Christian people are to think and then be active.<br><br>First, they are to "use the Word of God to identify evil". <br><br>Secondly, they are "to try to understand the times and channels by which evil is spread":<br><br>So we ask ourselves "How is Satan active? How is he getting this grip on our culture, splintering, fragmenting and poisoning it?" … The press, books and magazines, film and theatre, radio and TV – the media – are paramount. Then at a deeper level we need to study the attacks upon institutions – the family, school and the legal system … All these have been deeply penetrated by Satanic forces in the last two or three decades.<br><br>Thirdly, they are "never [to] reject alliances":<br><br>Where there are other Christians – even where there are non-Christians – who on a specific issue will denounce a manifest evil and determine to fight it, there we have a platform on which others may make common cause with us. As unashamed Christians we make no apology for our reasons in what we are doing. We tell the others, any audience we address or any group we organize, that we are in this fight because we are the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ. We confess that the law of God, our loving Father, forbids these things; we know that they will only bring cruelty, suffering and chaos. We make no bones about our allegiance, for we are men under authority. Yet at the same time we can say to others, "If you will join with us to fight this we welcome you."<br><br>Fourthly, as we have seen, they are to "get to grips with the intellectual debate."<br><br>Fifthly, they are to realize that there is a spiritual battle going on. So there must be prayer.<br><br>And, sixthly, they are "to strengthen the things that remain":<br><br>It is possible that our culture may collapse as did the culture of Rome. We know that the church of Jesus Christ will still persist, because we have his promise that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it (Matt 16.18) … But meanwhile it is our responsibility to arrest [the] decay wherever we can, to fight the pollution that is at present being publicly disseminated into the families of our land, and particularly to our children … Not everyone can do everything and some people can do nothing but pray (which may well turn out to be the most important ministry of all!). But many, many more could be doing far more than they are doing. <br><br>The root cause of the moral decline and cultural disintegration of Britain is undoubtedly to be found in the failure of the professing churches to testify to the goodness and severity of God, to the awesome Creator whose holiness convicts us but whose grace provides a wonderful pardon and restoration at the cost of the blood of the Divine Son. Failure to preach and to live by this gospel deprives a society of the preservative "salt" which the church is commanded to become. <br><br>Yet there is a mute rebuke to many of those who have remained faithful to the apostolic faith of the New Testament. It lies in our Lord's best known parable. The orthodox were so concerned with their religious tasks that they passed by on the other side, while the heretic was the man who saw the wounded traveller and had compassion, went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him.<br><br>Two things angered Raymond Johnston, first, the false teaching of heretics and, secondly, the passivity of the faithful.<br><br>So following Raymond Johnston, in God's strength, let us seek to be faithful and then to be active and not passive.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Multiculturalism, Islam and Christianity">(December 2001) Multiculturalism, Islam and Christianity</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2001</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>Islam</li><li>Muslim</li><li>Multculturalism</li><li>liberal</li><li>pluralist</li><li>ethnic minorities</li><li>religions</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Multiculturalism</b><br><br>Manzoor Moghal, the Chairman of the Federation of Muslim Organisations in Leicester, opposes "campaigners for multiculturalism". These campaigners not only encourage "the ethnic minority communities not to value Britishness"; but also they teach "the indigenous population to feel guilty about their own culture". And he goes on:</p>

<blockquote><div>Similarly, there is a reluctance among dogmatic multiculturalists to mark traditional festivals such as Christmas, for fear of giving offence. Such behaviour is particularly nonsensical when it is remembered that only 6 percent of the British population comes from ethnic minorities" (Daily Mail, 31 October 2001).</div></blockquote>

<p>In the Sunday Times on 14 October 2001, Melanie Phillips, who is Jewish, in a similar vein wrote about the "liberal imperialists" who force their western liberalism on others. "Yet these very same people hate and despise western culture as racist and colonialist and want to replace it altogether by a multicultural free-for-all ... Is it," she asks, "any wonder that Muslims despise the West as much as they fear it?" Her solution is simple:</p>

<blockquote><div>The West ... must vigorously defend and reassert liberal values on its home ground. That means, first and foremost, a reassertion of Christianity and an end to the craven apologetics and moral cultural relativism of the Church of England.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The Facts</b><br><br>Manzoor Moghal is right about his statistics. But he could have added that if we are hardly multicultural, we are certainly not multifaith. The percentage of those of other faiths is only 3 percent of the population. The latest reliable figures we have for religious belief come from this time last year and the latest British Social Attitudes Report. In answer to the question, "Do you regard yourself as belonging to any particular religion?" 51.9 percent claimed to be Christian; 3.1 percent claimed to belong to a non-Christian religion (with 1.5 percent claiming to be Muslim); 43.8 percent answered "no religion", with 1.2 percent Refusals/Don't knows. 1.5 percent of the population being Muslim means there are clearly less than a million Muslims. That is a far cry from the 2 million Muslims you regularly hear talked about on Radio or TV. Of course, people from other religions and none must have proper rights, freedoms and protections. But public policies and public arrangements must be based on fact, not myth.<br><br>And Melanie Phillips is quite right. The Church of England, certainly in terms of its leadership, is marked by "craven apologetics and moral and cultural relativism."<br><br>On the 27 November 2001 on the BBC Thought for the Day, the Bishop of Southwark was extolling the virtues of religious festivals such as "Diwali, Ramadhan, Guru Nanak's birthday, Christmas and Hanukkah ... We ought to know that the great festivals of every faith bring goodness to the whole community ... The great faiths ... can be part of the key to a world put right." Prince Charles, who should he ever be king, would be the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, wrote in the Daily Telegraph on 15 November 2001 as follows: "We share as Muslims and Christians a powerful core of spiritual belief - in one divine God, in the transience of our earthly life, in our accountability for our actions, and in the assurance of life to come ... The point is not that either side has a monopoly of the truth, or can lay claim more exclusively to a picture which is more true."<br><br>Such views seem to put the Bishop and the Prince on a collision course with the doctrine of the Church of England. That can be found in the Thirty-nine Articles. Those articles were drawn up in the 16th century, but are still normative for Anglicans in 2001. Article XVIII says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.</div></blockquote>

<p>No other article is so strong in its condemnation. No other article says that some one is "to be had accursed" for their views (these are words from Galatians 1.8-9). Nor is the primary focus of this article on the "Laws" or "Sects" themselves (i.e. other faiths). Nor is this a condemnation of tolerance, where tolerance is permitting what you think is wrong or false. No! This is a strong condemnation not of doctrinal tolerance, but of doctrinal indifferentism. It is a strong condemnation of those who say "any religion is good enough so long as you live a good life." It is a strong condemnation of those who equate the religions when Acts 4.12 says unambiguously of Jesus Christ: "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."<br><br>What is frightening is that it is becoming more and more difficult to say that anything is wrong or false in matters of religion, or that Christ offers a better way. On 10 October 2001 the wife of a vicar in the Blackburn diocese led prayers in St John's Church, Whittle-le-Woods and prayed for Muslims to be converted. A parent objected. So a spokesperson for the Blackburn diocese then told the BBC: "There will be strenuous efforts to make sure that this does not cause any more divisions in the community." The parent said, "In the current climate to voice sentiments like this, particularly in front of children who are as young as five, is entirely unacceptable."<br><br><br><b>Differences</b><br><br>But there are huge differences between the religions. There certainly are between Islam and Christianity. The first missionary to the Muslims in pre-Reformation times was Raymond Lull (1315). Contrary to Prince Charles' implication, he argued that Islam is so diverse in its doctrine of God. It denies the Trinity which is the belief that God has revealed himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit; and it denies the Incarnation of God in Jesus Christ. It claims that Jesus was just a prophet. You couldn't have more significant differences.<br><br>At the time of the Reformation, Melanchthon says in an introduction to a Latin Koran, that he thinks Mohammed "was inspired by Satan, because he does not explain what sin is and sheweth not the reason of human misery." Indeed, the Koran denies the cardinal fact that Jesus Christ died on the Cross. So Anselm's question is relevant for every Muslim: "Have you considered how great is the weight of sin?" The Crucifixion (which is a fact of history) opens our eyes to the terrible reality of man's estrangement from God in a way that Mohammed seems never to have seen.<br><br>With regard to ethics and public life, Jesus taught that there is a legitimate role for "Caesar" or the State which is different from the Church's role. Islam, however, is different in that it is a religion that is politically more theocratic. So the details of its Shariah Law cover the whole of life; and it has a different emphasis with regard to the use of force. The Koran can say (Sura 2.216): "Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you."<br><br>The Church of England Newspaper on 23 November 2001 reported Billy Graham's son and heir apparent, Franklin Graham, as saying rather bluntly: "It wasn't Methodists flying into those buildings [on 11 September]. It wasn't Lutherans. It was an attack on this country by people of the Islamic faith." That same edition had a headline, "Indonesian jihad declared" and said:</p>

<blockquote><div>An Islamic jihad has been declared against Christians in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, according to Christian sources in the region ... homes, churches, and schools are being destroyed. 'Sweeping operations' are being conducted against Christians attempting to travel from one place to another ... The lakeside village of Tentena which now has a population of 30,000 having taken in about 20,000 Christian refugees is completely isolated by jihad gangs who attack anyone who travels out of the area.</div></blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many moderate Muslims who are desperately anxious to distance their religion from such murderous activities. But dry theology cannot ignore how, on average, a religion is lived out. Millions have fled the Islamic world. It is reported that three-quarters of the world's refugees in the last decade have been from Muslim countries. Yes, many Muslims put many professing Christians to shame by the self discipline of their religious practice. But the Bible says you are not accepted by God because of what you do. You are accepted because of who you believe in - namely Jesus Christ, the risen Saviour, who invites you to trust him for free forgiveness. <br><br>We must never forget that "religion" of any sort can be demonic - that includes forms of the Christian religion. There has been much that is terrible in Christian history. Indeed it was "good" religious people (the Pharisees and the Sadducees) who killed Jesus. No one will be saved by their religion. All religions fall short. The Bible says, "It is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, - not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2.8-9).<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Intolerance and Tolerance">(January 2002) Intolerance and Tolerance</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2002</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Premier Christian Radio</b><br><br>The Spectator for 24 November 2001 contained an article by Dr Colin Nicholl, a lecturer in the Faculty of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. He was reporting on Premier, the London Christian Radio station, and its being given a 'Yellow Card' by the Radio Authority. "This means," he said, "that if the station does not mend its ways it could lose its licence." <br><br>He then researched the problem, looking at the Radio Authority's Quarterly Complaints Bulletin. It appeared that Premier had complaints far in excess of any other of the many stations; and all the complaints came from one source, the Mysticism and Occultism Federation whose website Nicholl then 'visited'. It showed, he claimed, that the federation has "five 'part-time unpaid volunteers' who monitor the media, particularly the Christian media, such as Premier Radio, looking for 'unfair' and 'offensive' comments which are exclusivistic or 'intolerant' of other 'spiritualities', such as Satanism, occultism, New Age, magic, astrology and divination."<br><br>So what were some of their complaints? They included one against an evangelical minister, Dr Michael Youssef. He had suggested that mainline churches were bowing to political correctness and accommodating to secular culture instead of trusting in Jesus alone, "the true redeemer, the true saviour, the only one who can make them whole." Jesus Christ, he said, was the only hope for our society. Also Dr Youssef expressed his conviction that it was "crazy" to claim that one can be a "practising homosexual" and a "good Christian" at the same time, in view of Paul's teaching in Romans 1. <br><br>How, then, did the Radio Authority react? They judged that these remarks "denigrated the beliefs of other people" and thus contravened the Programme Code. Nicholl, therefore, asked: "Is it now the case that only those Christians who interpret the Bible as permitting homosexual practice can air their views on radio?" He could have added that the 1998 Lambeth Conference of bishops of the world-wide Anglican communion would now also be 'Yellow Carded' on this basis!<br><br>Another complaint was against Chuck Swindoll. I know for a fact that many Christians have profited from Chuck's ministry over the years. For a government authority to outlaw such a man is, indeed, sinister. Nicholl writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>Another well-known evangelical preacher, Dr Charles Swindoll, warned Christians of the dangers of 'dabbling in the occult' and advised them to destroy any occult materials in their possession. In advocating this, Dr Swindoll was merely reiterating the counsel of Acts 19.19. However, in a rather fascinating PC judgment, the Radio Authority asserted that 'divination' was a part of some religious belief systems, and that Swindoll's homily was tantamount to denigration of others' beliefs. This ruling raises a number of questions: since Satanists worship Satan, is it similarly offensive to portray Satan in negative terms? Since the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks considered themselves to be obeying Allah, is it now denigration of others' beliefs to denounce them and their British counterparts as 'evil' and 'deceived' and to pronounce that theirs is a 'religion of terrorism'?</div></blockquote>

<p>The Spectator article finished with another question:</p>

<blockquote><div>One parting thought: in the light of this rather pathetic state of affairs, in which the broadcasting legislation is being interpreted in such a remarkably draconian way, what will be made of Part 5 of the government's anti-terrorism laws, which outlaws with the threat of up to seven years' imprisonment 'insulting words or behaviour likely to stir up hatred against a group of people because of their religious belief'?</div></blockquote>

<p>The anti-terror legislation and the facts<br><br>The answer to that question is this: fortunately, when these new proposed laws reached the House of Lords, Part 5 received a mauling. The Lords did not think much of this serious erosion of fundamental liberties and so they rejected the clauses on incitement to religious hatred. This forced David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, to agree to drop the proposals. So early on Friday morning, 14 December 2001, the anti-terror legislation became law without this new offence.<br><br>Undoubtedly there were good intentions on the part of those who wanted an offence for religious hatred. Since 11 September and the Muslim terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, there have been reports of attacks against individual Muslims in Britain (and against some Christians). Quite rightly, it was said, such behaviour should be outlawed. But the existing law, if applied, can be used against such behaviour. The Attorney-General in the House of Lords spoke of graffiti on a wall reading: "Avenge USA - Kill a Muslim Now!" That is wicked. But it already could be dealt with under current law, if there was a will. The main achievement of an incitement law would be to endanger the freedom of speech - one of our fundamental freedoms - and that includes freedom of speech for believing Christians. As citizens people of every faith should be treated equally before the law. But how should we view the relationships between the various religions as such in Britain? First, we need to establish the facts.<br><br>One of the most careful demographic surveys is British Social Attitudes. The latest British Social Attitudes - the 18th report (the 2001/2002 edition) has literally just been published. It reveals that contrary to what is commonly assumed, people are becoming more, not less, religious. To the question "Do you regard yourself as belonging to any particular religion?" in the previous 17th report (the 2000/2001 edition which I quoted in the Coloured Supplement for December 2001), 43.8 percent said they had "no religion", with 51.9 percent claiming to be Christian (mostly with a definite denominational or "grouping" affiliation) and with 3.1 percent claiming to be of other faiths. However, now, in this 18th report 39.5 percent said they had "no religion" - a 4.3 percent drop - while 55.2 percent claim to be Christian - an increase of 3.3 percent - and with 4.7 percent of other faiths - an increase of 1.6 percent.<br><br>Translated into actual population sizes these latest figures would give 23 million people in Britain with no religion (this excludes Northern Ireland); 32 million who claim to be Christian; and 2.7 million who claim to be of another faith. Interestingly, in terms of wider issues of national culture, only 11.6 percent were brought up with "no religion", while 82.9 percent were brought up as Christian, with 4.5 percent brought up in another faith. Translated into actual population sizes those figures give you 6.7 million brought up with "no faith"; 48 million brought up as Christian; and 2.6 million brought up with another faith.<br><br>Of further interest are the numbers of Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Muslims. 29.8 percent of the population now claim to be Anglican - that is a significant increase of 2.7 percent over the previous year. 9.2 percent claim to be Roman Catholic - an increase of 0.3 percent over the previous year; and 2 percent claim to be Muslim - an increase of 0.5 percent over the previous year. Translated into actual population sizes that gives you 17.3 million Anglicans; 5.3 million Roman Catholics; and 1.2 million Muslims.<br><br><br><b>The myth of religious pluralism</b><br><br>What do these figures tell us about Britain? They tell us that the majority of our citizens do not consider themselves to be irreligious. That means that we cannot allow secular atheistic or irreligious broadcasters, educationalists or politicians to speak for the majority. Nor can we allow such people to say that we are now a religiously pluralistic society. We are not!<br><br>The religious community makes up 60 percent of the population. Of that religious community 92 percent are Christian with 8 percent being of other faiths. Of that 8 percent, 1.7 percent are Hindu; 1.3 percent are Jewish; 3.4 percent are Muslim; 0.7 percent are Sikh; 0.2 percent are Buddhist; and 0.7 percent are of other non Christian faiths. To talk about "pluralism" without qualification is grossly misleading and positively dangerous. What we have in Britain is a "subordinate" religious pluralism. The dominant religious culture, as the figures show, is "Christian". This, of course, does not mean "bible believing" or "committed". However 10.5 percent of the total population in Britain seem to be going to a Christian church weekly now. A further 2 percent go at least once in two weeks; a further 5.7 percent go at least once a month; and a further 9.4 percent go twice a year or more. Nor do these attendances include special occasions like weddings, funerals and baptisms. That means that nearly 28 percent of the population are regular (in some way) church goers.<br><br>But is there a Christian view of how these (unequal) faith communities should live together? Does the desire for social peace mean we should still be looking for some form of legislation to outlaw religious hatred? Should there be an outlawing of any religious intolerance?<br><br>The Bible certainly gives us guidance about "religious hatred". But it suggests that we must be careful to make distinctions. We are, for example, to hate what is evil (Romans 12.9). The example of Jesus makes it clear that in this "day of grace" - between his two comings - we are to hate all sin. But at the same time we are to love the sinner. Jesus "hated" false religion and religious practices. Nor did his love mean keeping quiet or being politically correct. Jesus called the Pharisees "hypocrites", "blind guides", "blind fools", "like whitewashed tombs", "You snakes! You brood of vipers" (Matthew 23.15,16,17,27,33). And in Revelation we are told that Jesus also hates "the practices of Nicolaitans [an early sect]" (Revelation 2.6). But Jesus loved sinners, as is so clear from the Gospel accounts. One of the Pharisees' criticisms of Jesus was that, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them" (Luke 15.2).<br><br>Such hatred or intolerance of what is wrong comes from the fact that the truth matters. It is the truth that sets you free, Jesus taught (John 8.32). So there can be no genuine liberalism without the truth. And the first truth, concerning which there is to be no negotiation according to the Bible, is that there is only one true God (Exodus 20.3) and only one true way to that true God: that is through Jesus Christ (Acts 4.12).<br><br><br><b>The only true God</b><br><br>The Old Testament is God's preparation of his people so that conceptually and morally they would be ready for his supreme revelation in Christ. True, God only "spoke in fragmentary and varied fashion through the prophets [i.e. the Old Testament]" (Hebrews 1.1 [NEB])". But those "fragments" and that varied teaching is vital for our understanding of God. And the first lesson in understanding is there in the first commandment: "You shall have no other gods before me." So important was this lesson that there were, in Old Testament times, "holy wars" against pagan nations. By the time of Jesus, however, such "holy wars" are not to be the way to extend God's kingdom. On one occasion some Samaritans refused to welcome Jesus. When his "disciples James and John saw this, they asked, 'Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?' But Jesus turned and rebuked them" (Luke 9.54-55). Then later in the Garden of Gethsemane, at the time of the actual arrest of Jesus, Matthew tells us:</p>

<blockquote><div>With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 'Put your sword back in its place,' Jesus said to him, 'for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?'" (Matt 26.51-54).</div></blockquote>

<p>God's way of salvation is now not by the sword. We see that so clearly. But in that "fragmentary" Old Testament revelation terrible wars were necessary to establish this elementary and fundamental truth, namely that there is only one God - the God revealed in the Bible. People must not be ensnared by false gods (Deut 7.16). It is similar with adultery. In Old Testament times it merited the death penalty. Jesus, however, opposed the continued use of stoning for adultery. But while he did not condemn the woman "caught in the act" to be stoned, he still upheld the commandment, for he said to her: "Go now and leave your life of sin" (John 8.11). That capital sanction was to teach that reserving sex for marriage is also a fundamental truth.<br><br>Jesus saw that one of the devil's supreme temptations is to make people ignore the Old Testament command to "worship the Lord your God, and serve him only" (Matthew 4.10). He saw the importance not of inclusivity but of exclusivity when it comes to the worship of God. It is for this reason that individual Christians and Christian churches have to be intolerant of fundamental doctrinal error - especially the doctrinal error of "multifaithism". <br><br>And the New Testament church was clearly exclusive. It was concerned to exclude both false teaching and immoral behaviour. But a distinction was made between the Church and the world. So in 1 Corinthians 5 after Paul has adamantly written that there must be the disciplining of a person inside the church, he goes on to say this in verses 9-11:</p>

<blockquote><div>I have written to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people - not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler.

<p>Paul is saying that Christian believers are to be intolerant and hate error in the church; but with respect to people outside they are to be "tolerant". <br><br>Toleration is, of course, not indifferentism. You can only tolerate what you believe to be wrong or evil. Toleration is the determination not to take direct or forceful action to prevent the existence of what you believe to be wrong or evil. It is like the Parable of the Weeds where the wheat and the weeds "both grow together until the harvest" (Matthew 13.30). The servants were told, in effect, to tolerate the weeds. Therefore, as God is tolerant in this day of grace, so must we be. Therefore Christians are to "associate with ... people of this world who are ... idolaters" - and people of other faiths would be classed as "idolaters". So exclusivity is only for the church. However, this toleration does not mean you do not try to convert the "people of the world". Nor does it mean you should support, let alone promote idolatry (or other faiths). No! The Christian is to go into all the world to preach the good news to persuade people against idolatry.<br><br><br><b>The state and toleration</b><br><br>But what should the state do? How should the state relate to religious beliefs and religious beliefs the majority may believe erroneous?<br><br>The state is certainly entitled to use force - that is its essential distinctive. But the state is not the Church. Its duty is to keep order. Jesus said:</p>

<blockquote><div>Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's" (Matthew 22.21)</div></blockquote>

<p>This was, and is, so basic. Paul fills out the meaning of those words in Romans 13, where "Caesar" (or the state) is shown to be able to use force as "God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer" (verse 4). Paul has explained in the previous chapter that it is not up to the individual to "take revenge". He or she is to "leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord" (Romans 12. 19). That wrath - or judgment - will be fully revealed on the judgment day. But in the meantime for the good of society and to restrain the worst effects of fallen human beings, God delegates some of his judicial functions to the state and to governments (with a just war being an extension of those judicial functions).<br><br>But does this mean the state can use force for anything? No! It cannot enforce belief. As with the abolition of slavery it took centuries for this to be fully understood by Christians. It was some of the Puritans who saw this more than most. The disgraceful 1662 Act of Uniformity sought to enforce belief and forms of worship. It resulted in many good men, like Richard Baxter of Kidderminster, being forced out of their churches and ending up in gaol. So the stage was set for the Toleration Act of 1689 that followed the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688. John Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration, published in 1689, was also significant. In that letter he argued that belief cannot be forced by the power of the state. However, he never suggested that all beliefs could be treated as equal. Nor did he suggest that the state should be tolerant of immorality, rather the reverse. <br><br>The great western and Christian tradition of toleration was forged as a result of the Reformation and, yes, mistakes made on all sides. And that tradition has been clear until recently, certainly in the Church. It says that individual believers must be intolerant of fundamental doctrinal error - their commitment to the truth requires that. But individual believers in their relationships with non-believers must be "tolerant" - they will not seek to "force" them to make professions of faith. They realize that men and women have not only to "confess with their mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', but believe in their heart that God raised him from the dead" (Romans 10.9). And you cannot force the heart. The ideal government, then, is not one that enforces belief but one where civil order is maintained, so "that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness" (1 Timothy 2.3).<br><br>But the ideal government cannot be neutral. While it will allow freedom for religion, it inevitably will have some value system. Currently in the world, the main options are Christian, Muslim or Secular humanist. Both Islam and Secular humanism do not make the distinction between Caesar and God. Islam ideally would seek to abolish Caesar; secular humanism ideally would seek to abolish God. Both strategies are disastrous. Jesus' teaching is so essential for public health.<br><br>The Christian value system that has informed and shaped the evolution of Western democracies ensures a level of toleration because of the separation of Church and State. However, that toleration is not infinite. John Locke was clear that the magistrate must ban a religious group if it "should have a mind to sacrifice infants, or lustfully pollute themselves in promiscuous uncleanness, or practise any other such heinous enormities." Furthermore, democratic governments where there are a majority of Christian citizens should want their laws to reflect God's standards. Nor is there anything "intolerant" in the state privileging one religion, as is currently the case in Britain with the establishment of the (Protestant) Christian faith. Some choice has to be made.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Rich Man and Lazarus">(February 2002) The Rich Man and Lazarus</h2><ul><li>February 2002</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>

The Victorian first Bishop of Liverpool is always challenging on the subject of money. His own wealthy father was bankrupted when Ryle was in his twenties - David Holloway.]</i> <br></p>

<blockquote><div>19 "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 "The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' 25 "But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' 27 "He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' 29 "Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' 30 "'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' 31 "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead'" (NIV).</div></blockquote>

<p>The parable we have just read in one respect is unique in the Bible. It is the only passage of Scripture which describes the feelings of the unconverted after death. For this reason, as well as for many others, the parable deserves special attention. <br><br>We learn, first, from this parable that a person's condition in the world is no test of their state in the sight of God. <br><br>The Lord Jesus describes for us two men of whom one was very rich and the other very poor. The one "lived in luxury every day". The other was a mere "beggar" who had nothing that he could call his own. And yet of these two the poor man had grace and the rich had none. The poor man lived by faith and walked in the steps of Abraham. The rich man was a thoughtless, selfish worldly man, dead in transgressions and sins.<br><br>Let us never give way to the common idea that men and women are to be valued according to their income, and that those who have most money are those who ought to be most highly honoured. There is no authority for this notion in the Bible. The general teaching of Scripture is flatly opposed to it. "Not many wise; not many influential; not many of noble birth" are called (1 Cor 1.26). "Let not the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows me" (Jer 9.24). Wealth is no mark of God's favour. Poverty is no mark of God's displeasure. Those who God justifies and glorifies are seldom the rich of this world. If we would measure men and women as God measures them, we must value them according to their grace.<br><br>We learn, secondly, from this parable that death is the common end to which all classes of mankind must come. <br><br>The trials of the "beggar" and the luxurious living of the "rich man" alike ceased in the end. There came a time when both of them died. "All go to the same place" (Eccles 3.20).<br><br>Death is a great fact that all acknowledge but very few seem to realize. Most eat and drink and talk and plan as if they were going to live on earth for ever. True Christians must be on their guard against this spirit. "He that would live well," said a great divine, "should often think of his last day and make it his company-keeper." Against murmuring and discontent and envy when you are poor - against pride and self-sufficiency and arrogance when you are wealthy - there are few better antidotes than to remember death. "The beggar died" and his bodily needs were at an end. "The rich man died" and his high-life stopped for ever.<br><br>We learn, thirdly, from this parable that the souls of believers are specially cared for by God in the hour of death. <br><br>The Lord Jesus tells us that when the beggar died "the angels carried him to Abraham's side." There is something very comforting in this statement. We know little or nothing of the condition and feelings of the dead. When our own last hour comes and we lie down to die, we shall be like those who journey into an unknown country. But it may satisfy us to know that all who fall asleep in Jesus are in good keeping. They are not houseless, homeless wanderers between the hour of death and the day of resurrection. They are at rest in the midst of friends with all who have faith, like Abraham. They lack nothing. And, best of all, St Paul tells us they are "with Christ" (Phil 1.23).<br><br>We learn, fourthly, from this parable the reality and eternity of hell. <br><br>The Lord Jesus tells us plainly that after death the rich man was "in hell – in agony in this fire." He gives us a fearful picture of his longing for a drop of water "to cool his tongue" and of "the chasm" between him and Abraham, which could not be crossed. There are few more awful passages perhaps in the whole Bible than this. And the one from whose lips it came, it must be remembered, was one who delighted in mercy!<br><br>The certainty and endlessness of the future punishment of the wicked are truths which we must hold fast and never let go. From the day when Satan said to Eve, "You will not surely die," there have always been those who have denied them. Let us not be deceived. There is a hell for the impenitent as well as a heaven for believers. There is a wrath to come for all who "do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus" (2 Thess 1.8). From that wrath let us flee in good time to the great hiding-place, Jesus Christ the Lord. If people find themselves "in agony" at the end, it will not be because there was no way to escape.<br><br>We learn, fifthly, from this parable that the unconverted find out the value of a soul after death, when it is too late. <br><br>We read that the rich man desired Lazarus to be sent to his five brothers who were still alive, "so that they will not also come to this place of torment." While he lived he had never done anything for their spiritual good. They had probably been companions in worldliness and, like him, had neglected their souls entirely. When he is dead he finds out too late the folly of which they had all been guilty, and desires that, if possible, they might be called to repent.<br><br>The change that will come over the minds of unconverted men and women after death is one of the most fearful aspects of their future state. They will see and know and understand a hundred things to which they were obstinately blind while they were alive. They will discover that, like Esau, they have bartered away eternal happiness for a mere mess of potage. There is no doubt or unbelief after death. It is a wise saying of an old divine that "hell is nothing more than truth known too late."<br><br>We learn, lastly, from this parable that the greatest miracles would have no effect on human hearts, if people will not believe God's word. <br><br>The rich man thought that "if someone from the dead goes to my brothers they will repent." He argued that the sight of one who came from another world must surely make them aware, though the old familiar words of Moses and the Prophets had been heard to no effect. The reply of Abraham is solemn and instructive - "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."<br><br>The principle laid down in these words is of deep importance. The Scriptures contain all that we need to know in order to be saved; and a messenger from the world beyond the grave could add nothing to them. It is not more evidence that is wanted in order to make people repent, but a commitment to make use of what they already know. The dead could tell us nothing more than the Bible contains, if they rose from their graves to instruct us. After the first novelty of their testimony was worn away, we would care no more for their words than the words of any other. This terrible waiting for something that we do not have and neglect of what we do have, is the ruin of thousands of souls. Faith, simple faith in the Scriptures which we already possess, is the first thing necessary for salvation. The man who has the Bible and can read it, and yet waits for more evidence before he becomes a decided Christian, is deceiving himself. Unless he wakes from his delusion, he will die in his sins.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Are the Gospels True?">(March 2002) Are the Gospels True?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2002</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>[Easter comes at the end of the month. There are bound to be some Radio or TV producers, journalists or liberal theologians who say you cannot trust the New Testament records about the resurrection of Jesus. The following is a chapter (abbreviated) from a book I wrote in 1983, Where did Jesus Go? - the truth and meaning of the Resurrection.The last section on John and Luke's Gospels I have included again from four years ago. It may be of help. DRJH]</i><br><br><br><b>A common fallacy</b><br><br>Over the last 200 years the Bible has come in for an unprecedented amount of criticism. It is remarkable how well it has stood the test. Emil Brunner tells an interesting story to prove the point: "Two hundred years ago, scoffing Voltaire, probably the most famous man of his time, prophesied that all would soon be over with the Bible. The house in which this boast was made is to-day one of the offices of a great Bible society. Voltaire's name is almost forgotten; the Bible has had, in the meantime, an incredible career of triumph throughout the world."<br><br>Perhaps one of the greatest causes for distrusting the New Testament records is a common fallacy; and the Bible more than any other book has been subject to this. It is the fallacy that says that if you have explained the origins of something and seen that these are very different to the final product, you have explained away the final product.<br><br>It is amazing how powerfully destructive a knowledge of origins can be. But, of course, to know the origin of something is irrelevant often as far as its present value, truth or effectiveness is concerned. A man may be born in a log cabin. But if he ends up in the White House as President of the United States of America, he is the President no matter what his origins. Modern astronomy may have evolved from astrological guesswork in ancient Babylon. But if men can travel to the moon and back today, it is clearly more than guesswork now. So it is with the Bible.<br><br>The four Gospels may well be the result of godly men in the mid-first century AD collecting earlier written sources as "Source Criticism" has suggested. Or the Gospels may have resulted in part from regularly told short stories from the life of Jesus as "Form-Criticism" has suggested. And most probably the Gospel writers put their material together, from whatever source, to emphasise a particular truth about God's revelation of himself in Jesus Christ, as "Redaction-Criticism" has suggested. But by itself all this tells us nothing about whether what we have got as the final product is true or false, accurate or inaccurate. Something in the Gospel narrative may be said by the scholars to come "from 'Q' (a collection of Jesus' teachings) or from 'M' (Matthew's special source)" or to come "in the 'Form of a miracle-story'". But by itself that tells us nothing as to whether what comes like that is true or false. The mere fact that the report of a miracle may be given in a stylised way tells us little. The question "Was there a miracle there in the first place?" is a different question from "How has the report of the alleged miracle come down to us?"<br><br><br><b>Tradition</b><br><br>The gospel of the resurrection of Jesus Christ was originally passed on by word of mouth. The Resurrection happened (or something happened). The Apostles then spoke about it and "preached" it and they spoke about Jesus. Maybe some of them had taken down notes earlier of specific teachings of Jesus; but there is no record of these in the Acts of the Apostles. All we hear about is "preaching". All we can be certain of is an oral tradition. But such an oral tradition would have been nothing new.<br><br>In the Old Testament there must have been an "Oral Tradition". It is not unreasonable to think of the stories of the patriarchs and the judges as being handed down by word of mouth and repeated at the various sanctuaries; these would have been associated with the various Old Testament heroes. It has been suggested that Abraham may have been associated with Shechem and Hebron, Isaac with Beersheba, Jacob with Bethel and Shechem and Gideon with Ophrah. In addition stories would have been handed down within the various tribes and clans. But of course often the "tradition", or the "handing down", would have related to large spans of time.<br><br>Take the sojourn in Egypt and the Exodus; or take the settlement in Canaan, or the period of the Monarchy or the period when successively the Assyrians, the Babylonians and the Persians were the superpowers. These were centuries long. The oral tradition in those days covered hundreds of years. Nor is there anything odd about this. You get it in other ancient cultures. And from what we know of some of these there is evidence of a very tight oral tradition. In the period of the passing on of material by word of mouth, before it is eventually written down, it is handed on in relatively careful ways. You can think for example of the Homeric poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey; here the verse form acts as a control. This can be paralleled at various stages of European literature.<br><br>Inevitably in the transmission of Old Testament material before it was written down there would have been stylisation. That is to say the way you tell one story is influenced by the way you tell a different story. Details may get lost. But there is no evidence that you can invent "ad lib".<br><br>But - and it is a very big but - the New Testament is totally different to all of this. As has been well pointed out "the period of the New Testament covers fewer decades than the Old Testament covers centuries."<br><br>Eventually, after the initial preaching, the New Testament Gospels or the sources behind them came to be written down. What had been repeated orally, by word of mouth, was now in a manuscript, a hand-written document, and to that extent fixed. <br><br>But prior to that "fixing" had the "tradition" been radically modified? That is the big question. Had the oral tradition grown? Of course oral tradition can grow.<br><br>But the check on the growth of any tradition is the fact of other people being around who know differently. They can let it be known that certain things are fiction. This means that the presence at large of "eyewitnesses" of any alleged event that has now become a "tradition" is of first rate importance.<br><br>This is highly relevant for our evaluation of the New Testament. Even at the end of the first century AD a few eyewitnesses of the ministry of Jesus and of the events surrounding his death and resurrection were still alive. There were many more who had known and spoken with eyewitnesses. They heard their reports of what they had seen and heard. "Some people seem to imagine that, after the initial telling of the story (of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus) every eyewitness immediately and for ever withdrew from the whole affair. The fact is that right up to the beginning of the stage of writing and well on into it, there were in the church surviving eyewitnesses whose oversight of the tradition must have been sufficient to ensure substantial accuracy in its transmission."<br><br><br><b>Memory span</b><br><br>It is clear that there were written accounts of the gospel events earlier than the four Gospels as we have them (Luke 1.1). And we have Paul's statement on the resurrection appearances in the first epistle to the Corinthians. This was made ten or fifteen years earlier than the usual dating of Mark's Gospel. There were thus accounts of the Resurrection nearer to the events than the Gospels themselves. But leaving all that aside and just thinking about the finished product of Mark's Gospel, we need to remember that even this was published only thirty-five years or so after the Resurrection.<br><br>C.H.Dodd, the New Testament scholar, once said that in his younger days he felt this gap of thirty-five years to be a "very serious matter". Later in life he came to see that such a period was not so long after all. In a Radio broadcast in 1949 he said that he and his contemporaries had a very vivid memory of the events of the summer of 1914 just prior to the outbreak of the first World War. He went on: "When Mark was writing there must have been many people who were in their prime under Pontius Pilate, and they must have remembered the stirring and tragic events of that time at least as vividly as we remember 1914. If anyone had tried to put over an entirely imaginary or fictitious account of them, there would have been middle-aged or elderly people who would have said (as you or I might say) 'You are wasting your breath: I remember it as if it were yesterday!'"<br><br>As I write this on my typewriter, I hear over the Radio that today is the thirtieth anniversary of the death of the King George VI. On that day there was a new Queen of the United Kingdom. I can remember quite vividly standing in my school hall and being told by the headmaster of the King's death. I can remember many events from that period; it was when I was at the top end of the Junior School. I could not necessarily give you an accurate chronological sequence of all the events; but I could recount a lot of them as isolated events. Most important of all if someone came along and said that something major had happened at the school when it hadn't, or he totally misrepresented what had happened, I would be able to say he was speaking nonsense. [As I write this Coloured Supplement at my computer all that is still true at the fiftieth anniversary of the death of King George VI.]<br><br>And, of course, where there is a great deal of teaching by word of mouth memory becomes more important. It appears that the Jewish Rabbis employed memorising techniques in their transmission of teaching. Clearly Jesus was different to the other religious teachers of his day; we cannot assume that he copied their teaching techniques anymore than he copied their teaching. But in a culture where memory was important, a cavalier approach to the passing on of facts and information is not to be expected. In fact in such a culture memory is often developed to a high degree; and people have better memories than many of us have in our instant "electronic recall" world! This apparently is true in parts of India where the training of the verbal memory is regarded as being very important.<br><br><br><b>Prophets and private revelations</b><br><br>But what about the influence of "Christian prophets" in developing and creating tradition. Some might say: "People will ignore memory when a 'prophet' is around and be afraid to contradict when a man says, 'I, the Lord speak to you.' Perhaps Christian prophets made up edifying stories." The evidence for this is non existent. In any case prophets are always "the odd man out". As far as the majority is concerned they find them an embarrassment. That prophets should have been responsible for the creation of fictions about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus is unthinkable. "The role of prophets in the formation of the tradition," says F.F.Bruce, "has been greatly exaggerated. We have simply no concrete evidence to indicate that prophets in church meetings uttered words in the name of the exalted Lord which were preserved in the tradition as sayings of Jesus 'in the days of his flesh.' From the few details of prophetic utterances that have been recorded in the New Testament, they seem to have been pedestrian in character, relating to ad hoc situations."<br><br>To assume that prophets were responsible for words and deeds ascribed to Jesus in the four Gospels is hardly worth refuting. To assume that prophets could have given rise to the Resurrection is, of course, even more ridiculous.<br><br>Another check on the development of fictitious ideas and stories was the fact that the gospel was not private. This is very significant. It was the Gnostic sects that believed in "secret" revelations; it is not surprising that bizarre and obviously fictional stories about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus emerged from them. But the Church under the Apostles believed that the gospel belonged to the church as a whole. There was something corporate about it. It was an "open secret".<br><br>So there was a concern for the "unity" of the tradition. People wanted to check up on the facts. Paul himself wanted to consult with the Christians in Jerusalem. In one sense he was totally independent of Jerusalem and doing a quite separate work in his Gentile mission. But he decided early on to go up to Jerusalem to check things out. He decided to put before the leaders there "the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, lest somehow I should be running or had run in vain" (Gal. 2.2). Paul clearly believed that he had received his commission and his gospel directly from the exalted Christ. He had not received it from the Jerusalem leaders (Gal. 1.1). But he "checked it out" with them.<br><br>There is no evidence for individual Christians in the early Apostolic Church having "private" visions and on that basis generating "stories".<br><br><br><b>John's Gospel</b><br><br>The Gospels are four different accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They are quite unique in the history of literature; they are not biographies in the modern sense. A disproportionate amount of them is given over to the last week of Jesus' life. John says of what he has written in his Gospel, especially the "signs" - and the greatest sign is the Resurrection - that he has been selective. He has only written a fraction of what he could (John 21.25). He says: "These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name" (John 20.31). John clearly had a theological purpose. But he is not for the moment suggesting he is fabricating "signs". He says he makes his theological points by selection from actual incidents and events - that is what he thought he was doing; there is not the slightest hint he was making his theological points by the creation of imagined incidents and events. But can we trust John?<br><br>John's Gospel has had a recent "rehabilitation". For many years it was said that John's Gospel was written late. It was said that the writer, whoever he was (and according to this view he certainly had nothing to do with the Apostle John of the twelve), just took Matthew, Mark and Luke and rewrote them! He rewrote the facts even! This was the reason, it was said, why John seems so different from the other three synoptic gospels (synoptic means literally "seeing together"). But the argument went on like this: if John could freely rewrite the other existing Gospels, why shouldn't those other three have done just the same thing with their sources? Why not indeed?<br><br>Then C.H.Dodd gave the Sarum Lectures for 1954-55. These were published as Historical Tradition in the Fourth Gospel. He proved overwhelmingly that John was not dependent on the other Gospels for his sources. He did not rewrite them therefore. He couldn't have done. Rather, Dodd showed, in John's Gospel we have an independent tradition of material from Southern Palestine. We can't dismiss what John says about the Resurrection.<br><br>So now when C.H.Dodd comes to look at the narratives in John about the Resurrection and in particular Peter and John's visit to the tomb, he sees evidence of eyewitnesses rather than fabrication. He sees this in the account of the two Apostles' visit to the tomb. When they got there, they "saw the linen cloths lying, and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself" (John 20.6-7).<br><br>The body of Jesus had been wrapped in long strips of cloth and spices had been put in between. The "napkin" was a separate piece of linen wrapped over the head and under the chin to keep the jaw in place. What John's Gospel says is that when John saw these "cloths" he believed. He believed, that is to say, not when he saw the empty tomb, but when he saw the "napkin" still separate from the rest of the linen wrappings that had been round the trunk and legs; it seemed as though the body had passed through the linen cloths. This was no resuscitation. It was a resurrection! The body had not revived, it had disappeared. "The story," says Dodd, "is told with dramatic realism of which this writer is master. It looks something as near first-hand evidence as we could hope to get. Perhaps it is, and if so, it becomes the sheet anchor of belief in a 'bodily resurrection'."<br><br>Again it was Dorothy Sayers who was quite convinced of the "eyewitness" nature of John's Gospel. Looking at the Gospel as a novelist herself and so from the viewpoint of someone used to "creating" or "fabricating stories", she says this: "It must be remembered that, of the four Evangelists, St John's is the only one that claims to be the direct report of an eyewitness. And to anyone accustomed to the imaginative handling of documents, the internal evidence bears out the claim."<br><br><br><b>Luke's Gospel</b><br><br>But John is not the only Gospel writer who tells us what he is aiming to do as he selects his material. Luke also tells us of his aims. "In as much as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been accomplished among us, just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account" (Luke 1.1-3).<br><br>Despite attempts to discredit Luke over the years, it is quite remarkable how he has withstood the test. Indeed what is noticeable is how modern experts who approach the New Testament from the view point of secular ancient history find Luke convincing. Those used to evaluating ancient documents and sources from the classical world of Greece and Rome say Luke is a good historian. A.N.Sherwin-White, a Roman Historian, is amazed at the scepticism of some New Testament critics. Having examined the New Testament, especially Luke and Acts, from the view point of Roman law and culture he finds it remarkably reliable.<br><br>One of the reasons why Luke has been "attacked" is because he has an interest in the miraculous. This is undeniable.<br><br>"Sober criticism," writes G.B.Caird, "cannot get behind the gospel record to a plain, commonplace tale, devoid of the miraculous and the supernatural. The early Christians believed that, in Christ, God had been at work in new and astonishing ways and they had the evidence of their own eyes to support their faith. Luke cannot justly be accused of exaggerating the miraculous element in his narrative. He omits Mark's most difficult miracle, the story of the barren fig tree. It is true that he also goes one step beyond Mark in recording a cure performed at a distance by word of command, but his story, the healing of the centurion's servant, was taken from Q, his most trustworthy source. He has sometimes been taken to task for emphasising the physical nature of the Resurrection since it is in his Gospel alone that the risen Jesus eats and drinks with his disciples. But here too he is simply reproducing with fidelity the sources on which he was relying. For in Acts 10.37-43 he puts into the mouth of Peter an almost credal utterance which is clearly derived from an Aramaic source and which presents the same picture of the Resurrection as we find in the Gospel."<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The origins of the Gospels may be complicated, but that doesn't entitle us to dismiss their evidence. There were surviving eyewitnesses and other factors to prevent gross exaggeration in reporting or pious additions. There is every reason for saying we are dealing, in the Gospels, with accurate records.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Intelligent Design and the New Thought Police">(April 2002) Intelligent Design and the New Thought Police</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2002</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Guardian and Prime Minister's Questions</b><br><br>On Saturday 9 March the Guardian newspaper, quite to my surprise, featured on page 3 a huge picture of our church notice board with the words "Jesmond Parish Church" in yellow on black, and with me in front of it. The page had the banner headline: "Top school's creationists preach value of biblical story over evolution;" and the whole of the page was given over to the issue. The school was Emmanuel College, Gateshead. The caption under the picture was, "the Revd David Holloway, traditionalist and a founding member of the fundamentalist Christian Institute, along with Emmanuel's former head John Burn." The article was attacking, it would seem, me, John Burn (our Lay Reader), the Christian Institute and by association, Reform. It clearly didn't like creationism. I was being identified, presumably, as a creationist.<br><br>On Wednesday 13 March - the following Wednesday - in Prime Minister's Questions, a Lib Dem MP, Dr Jenny Tonge, asked Tony Blair,</p>

<blockquote><div>Is the Prime Minister happy to allow the teaching of creationism alongside Darwin's theory of evolution in state schools?</div></blockquote>

<p>And the Prime Minister replied:</p>

<blockquote><div>I am very happy. Secondly, I know that the hon. Lady is referring to a school in the north-east, and I think that certain reports about what it has been teaching are somewhat exaggerated. It would be very unfortunate if concerns about that issue were seen to remove the very strong incentive to ensure that we get as diverse a school system as we properly can. In the end, a more diverse school system will deliver better results for our children. If she looks at the school's results, I think she will find that they are very good.</div></blockquote>

<p>Later that afternoon I was asked to take part in a debate with Jenny Tonge on the BBC Today programme the following morning. I agreed, only to find in the event that Richard Dawkins, the confessed atheist and zealot for macro-evolutionism from Oxford, had been substituted and it was to be two straight interviews with Dawkins having the last word. However, I was able to spell out in summary form what I believe about "creation" in reply to questions from James Naughtie who assumed creationists all wanted to "date" creation. I began by saying, "I totally disagree with that" and then went on to say:</p>

<blockquote><div>The bible speaks with brilliant simplicity in Genesis 1-3. In the same way as there's simplicity when I say the 'sun rose this morning'. To say the 'sun rose' is not scientific from a Copernican point of view, but it communicates a real happening. So what Genesis teaches, and mainstream Christians believe, is that God caused the world, the world didn't cause God. Mind gave rise to matter; not matter to mind. But Darwin and secular humanists teach not just micro-evolution, which we all believe in, namely the survival of the fittest which is common sense, but macro-evolution where matter does give rise to mind and where an impersonal world gives rise to a personal God.</div></blockquote>

<p>I explained that creationism covers a wide range of views and underlined that what I and others oppose is not fact but philosophy: "I don't know how many people read Darwin. Darwin did not just believe what we consider to be science which is perfectly legitimate, but Darwin evolved a philosophy of the universe. Darwin believed, for example, through macro-evolution that the higher races would eliminate the lower races."<br><br>However, it was pointed out to me that in a lecture given at the College last year the vice-Principal said, "As Christian teachers it's essential we're able to counter the anti-creationist position". I responded by giving the "anti-creationist position". I quoted an American Position Statement for biology in schools that says: "The diversity of life on earth is the outcome of evolution - an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable and natural process of temporal descent." And I added, "That is philosophy. That is not science."<br><br>Then it seemed right to mention the National Curriculum that requires the teaching of what it calls Scientific Enquiry. "I don't know how many people realize this but 'Pupils should be taught how scientific controversies can arise from different ways of interpreting empirical evidence (for example, Darwin's theory of evolution)'."<br><br>So Emmanuel was simply keeping to the Law. "As I understand it from the headmaster, and I've discussed it with him, he believes that it's right that every position should be taught." I pointed out that the school is successful. So parents want their children to go there. "This school got 96 percent - 5 GCSE's A-C's [in 2001] whereas the national average is 50 percent and in Newcastle it is 36 percent." And I concluded by saying:</p>

<blockquote><div>I happen to disbelieve in macro-evolutionism, not because I'm a flat-earther. It's just I think it's wrong. And so do many serious scientists - palaeontologists and others - who do not agree with the current position on evolution as is propounded by a number of atheistic philosophers.</div></blockquote>

<p>Since that Guardian article and that interview, the subject of "creationism" and what should be taught in our schools has regularly been in the news. <br><br><br><b>Fundamentalism, Evolution and Creation </b><br><br>Let me spell out a little more fully my own views. These can be found, in detail, in chapter 7 of my book, Church and State in the New Millennium which is entitled 'Fundamentalism, Evolution and Creation'. I argue that there are philosophical, theological and factual issues and all have to be addressed.<br><br>Among other things with regard to philosophy, I argue that ever since Wittgenstein it is wise to see "some scientific theories as models with built-in inferring techniques which help you to make deductions, rather than as 'descriptions' of reality." This was the view of Professor Stephen Toulmin, the philosopher of science. In an important long essay 'Contemporary Scientific Mythology' Toulmin wrote about evolution. He pursued the idea that while some scientific theories can be empirically helpful, they are not always the straightforward descriptions of reality they seem to be at first sight. Ordinary words and concepts can have their meanings subtly changed. This then disorientates the unwary. <br><br>He made the observation that "as the subject matter of physics provides the imagery of despair, so that of biology provides the imagery of hope." He was referring to the Second Law of Thermodynamics that obliges us to think of the universe as running down, while the popular understanding of evolution is that the universe is getting better and better. It is, therefore, difficult to see how both of these pictures, if they are real predictions, can be true at the same time. Toulmin's suggestion is that such theories are one half science and one half 'metaphysics'. Metaphysics are background beliefs or assumptions about ultimate things. So Toulmin's view is that "the Running-Down Universe [and] Evolution with a capital E ... are two examples which ... are not so much scientific discoveries as scientific myths." I then wrote: "This is not, in itself, to argue that the scientific theories on which these views are based must be immediately rejected as 'scientific' theories. They may be the best we can do to make sense of the data at the moment. They may be good theories. But we have to ask questions about precisely what they are saying. Are they descriptions or are they models?"<br><br>Then with regard to theology and the biblical material I argue that the elemental Christian view of origins is expressed neatly and profoundly in Hebrews 11.3: "By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible." This is known as creatio ex nihilo - creation out of nothing - as opposed to the idea that there was an ever-existent 'material' universe out of which God formed the world. There was, Hebrews teaches, no eternal dualism of God and matter. God was responsible for creating the material universe. There was, therefore, a 'beginning', and history is to be thought of as linear, not cyclical. And I quoted the following on Genesis 1.1:</p>

<blockquote><div>Natural scientists and philosophers have attempted to explain nature or the world; but not one of their theories or suggestions has remained firm or unshaken; each has been overthrown by its successor ... Those for whom the concept of 'God' is meaningless are unwilling to admit that a rational being was in control at the inception of the Universe ... Take the 'materialists' - those who say matter is all there is, matter is ultimate, or put more technically, atoms, molecules etc. (invisible entities) coalescing make up the visible world. It is because they don't know how to say, 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth' (Gen 1.1). An atheistic philosophy of the world has misled them; and it appears then that nothing governs or rules the universe, but all is given up to mere chance. To guard us from such an error the writer of the creation narrative in Genesis, with his very first words, flashes into our minds the name of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>That was not someone arguing against Darwin in the nineteenth century. It was from the pen of Basil of Cappadocia in the fourth century. We are in great danger of thinking that the issues of science and religion belong exclusively to modern times. Christians down the centuries have realized that the language of Genesis must be respected for what it is. The records of Genesis 1-3 are clearly not like the records of the Acts of the Apostles. Writing in the 16th century, Calvin said in his commentary on Genesis: "Moses wrote in the popular style, which, without instruction, all ordinary persons endowed with common sense are able to understand." And more recently in 1950 Pope Pius XII spoke of the early chapters of Genesis in Humani Generis:</p>

<blockquote><div>Although it is not right to judge them by the modern standards, such as would be applied to the great classical authors, or to the learned of our own day, they do nevertheless come under the heading of history ... These chapters have a naive, symbolical way of talking, well suited to the understanding of a primitive people.</div></blockquote>

<p>With regard to empirical or factual issues, I deal with a range of problems. However, I conclude as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Chapters 1-3 of Genesis still raise certain questions. But after nearly 150 years of detailed argument and analysis, many thoughtful people at the beginning of the 21st century are coming to the conclusion that Darwin does not provide the answers. Is it not wrong, therefore, to give the ideology of evolution a privileged place in our education today? As a 'myth' or 'model' it may have value if it secures results. But it should not then be taught, with all the secular prejudices we are now so used to, as reflecting what really happened in history. T.H.Huxley invented the word 'agnostic' with regard to belief in God. Surely agnosticism with regard to the theory of evolution is what is now called for in our schools. This is not an unreasonable demand for Christians to make in respect of twenty-first-century education.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The new Thought Police</b><br><br>The issues at stake are huge. First, there is the matter of intellectual freedom. We have new, self-appointed, Thought Police. They are wanting to stop schools like Emmanuel teaching young people about Intelligent Design (a more informative term than "creationism"). But Intelligent Design, for a Christian, is clearly demanded by the Bible and the whole weight of Christian tradition. Intelligent Design, of course, leaves open for discussion the proper way to exegete the Genesis narratives. It also leaves open for discussion the age of the universe and what are the best scientific "myths" or models for accounting for biological and geological data. That is why there are a range of creationist views, not just one. Nor is there only one view at Emmanuel College. But all are united in saying "No!" to atheistic doctrinaire macro-evolutionism which is the standard fare in many schools. Many of the new Thought Police are wanting to impose this view virtually by law. They are lobbying the Government, the Chief Inspector of Schools and the Quality and Curriculum Authority. This is quite sinister. Nor is this exaggerating. On 27 March on the BBC Today programme it was reported that "Thirty six scientists and philosophers have sent a letter to the government, the Chief Scientific Officer and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority expressing alarm that creationism theory is being taught in schools". They want to prevent this. <br><br>One of these new Thought Police, interviewed on the programme, was a Professor of Biology at University College London. He supports the ban and, typically, caricatures "creationists" as being people like those who teach "the sun goes round the earth". That is quite unacceptable. The former Bishop of Birmingham, Hugh Montefiore, himself a distinguished academic as well as a churchman, not so long ago reviewed Philip E. Johnson's Darwin on Trial for the Church Times. This was in the form of a C.S.Lewis' Screwtape Letter with Screwtape (the senior devil) saying:</p>

<blockquote><div>Fortunately, we have been so successful that anyone who tries to debunk neo-Darwinism is generally regarded by society as a crank. You must keep on preventing those scientists who are adherents of the Enemy from criticising evolution through natural selection. You must try to spread abroad the idea that the only alternative to Darwinism is the belief that the world was created by the Enemy in six days. Don't try to persuade people that Darwinism is true – we know it isn't – but that there is no alternative explanation that is credible today.</div></blockquote>

<p>Either the Professor knows of the significant work that is going on in the United States by Intelligent Design theorists - and this should be referred to by any responsible biology teacher in the classroom, whether they agree with it or disagree. There is the work, for example, of Michael Behe, William A. Dembski and, the philosopher, Stephen Meyer (and not all Intelligent Design theorists are Christian). If he knows of this work, the Professor seemed only to identify "creationism" with one set of views which is quite unacceptable. Or the Professor doesn't know of this work. Should he then be holding a chair at UCL? Other Darwinian Thought Police include Nicholas Humphrey, the psychologist, who in an Amnesty Lecture in Oxford said: "Children have a right not to have their minds addled by nonsense. And we as a society have a duty to protect them from it. So we should no more allow parents to teach their children to believe in the literal truth of the Bible ... than we should allow parents to knock their children's teeth out or lock them in a dungeon."<br><br>With regard to the "young earth" issue I myself have no competence to judge on dating. I have been impressed, however, by the work of Steve Austin, the geologist, following the relatively recent eruption of Mount St Helen's in the US on 18 May 1980 and his attempt to reintroduce catastrophe theory. The volcano's eruption and the succeeding years have provided a real-time laboratory for testing theories of geological formation. What he has discovered is that canyons and rock layers, far from taking millions of years to develop, can form in a few years if natural volcanic forces are great enough. This also has major implications for coal theory. Even the most committed Darwinist ought to discuss this in the science class. <br><br>But I take a more cautious approach to the reading of Genesis than some "young earth" theorists. With two accounts of creation in Genesis presented consecutively, it does not seem a straightforward historical narrative. And it seems figurative and symbolic in places, for example, the "tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" - the Tree of Life reappears in the Book of Revelation. This, of course, does not mean that Genesis is not referring to what happened in the past. It simply means we have to be sensitive to the way the language refers to what happened. Jesus, we must remember, used figurative language to summarize centuries of history in the Parable of the Tenants in Matthew 21.33-41. And, of course, Revelation refers to "what must soon take place" (Rev. 1.1) but then uses symbolism throughout.<br><br>There is another account of Creation - namely in Job. That certainly uses figurative language. The first question of God to Job is very important: "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand" (Job 38.4). And the answer expected is "No!". The point of Job's vision is that the creator God is too immense and awesome for Job fully to fathom. It is obvious he cannot grasp the greatness of creation, including the beginning of creation (so he should not be too surprised that he doesn't fully understand the mystery of suffering - the issue in the Book of Job). The conclusion comes in the words of Job addressed to God in 42.2: "I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted. You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know." I am sure that is the right attitude for all of us in response to Genesis in particular, and as we think about all these issues in general. As St Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, "Now I know in part; then (referring to Christ's Second Coming and the future in Heaven) I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (v 12). Then we shall all be able to know about the origins of the universe.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>But in the meantime we must realise that there is an atheistic philosophy parading as "science" among proponents of doctrinaire neo-Darwinism. And this is claiming exclusive rights to the science timetable. "This starts with the definition of science itself," writes Nancey Pearcey. "Science is typically defined as objective investigation (discovering and testing facts) - the means for making faster aeroplanes and better medicines. But there's another definition held implicitly in the scientific establishment, and it is tantamount to the philosophy of materialism or naturalism. This is the idea that science may legitimately employ only natural causes in explaining everything we observe. The way this definition of science operates is to outlaw any questioning of naturalistic evolution. Darwinists don't ask whether life evolved from a sea of chemicals; they only ask how it evolved. They don't ask whether complex life forms evolved from simpler forms; they only ask how it happened. The presupposition is that natural forces alone must (and therefore can) account for the development of all life on earth; the only task left is to work out the details."<br><br>The Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin is typical of this approach. While admitting huge disagreements among evolutionists, he says: "we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism ... we are [then] forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations ... materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door." As Paul Nelson comments, "Design is ruled out not because it has been shown to be false but because science itself has been defined as applied materialistic philosophy." <br><br>We cannot allow this in the interests of true science. The Intelligent Design biochemist, Michael Behe, has challenged the old Darwinian orthodoxy over cells when he introduced the concept of irreducible complexity. He argues that Darwinian natural selection and random mutation can account for cumulative complexity (something like a city) but not irreducible complexity (something like a mousetrap) where "design" is a better model. And a cell is more like a mousetrap. You can remove people and services from a city until it is a tiny village - all without losing the sense of community, the city's "function". But remove any one of the components of a mousetrap and it cannot "function". Yet the new Thought Police want to prevent even discussion of such ideas in the science lesson. A neutral observer, surely, would judge that all this defensiveness and hysteria indicate an inherent vulnerability in Darwinism.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Facts and Figures">(May 2002) Facts and Figures</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2002</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>"Last Sunday"</b><br><br>Recently Mark Noll, of Wheaton College, USA, was surveying what had happened to world Christianity during the 20th century. He began by noting that the famous missionary conference held in Edinburgh in 1910 had fourteen hundred delegates but only eighteen were from outside Europe or North America. The conference was planning the evangelization of the world. The slogan from the end of the 19th century was: "The Evangelization of the World in this Generation". And people were assuming there would be a simple extension of Western Christianity. "What actually happened," said Noll, "was dramatically different. The surprises as well as the magnitude of developments in the twentieth-century history of Christianity can be illustrated by considering a series of comparisons for present realities of this past week:<br><br>•	Last Sunday it is probable that more believers attended church in China than in all of so-called Christian Europe. <br>•	Last Sunday more Anglicans attended church in each of Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda than did Anglicans in Britain and Episcopalians in the United States combined - and the number of Anglicans at church in Nigeria was several times the number in these other African countries. <br>•	Last Sunday more Presbyterians were at church in Ghana than in Scotland, and more were at church in the United Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa than in the United States. <br>•	Last Sunday more members of the Assemblies of God in Brazil were in church than the combined total of the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ in the United States. <br>•	Last Sunday more people attended the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul (Pastor Paul Yonggi Cho) than attended all of the churches of significant American denominations like the Christian Reformed Church, the Evangelical Free Church, or the Presbyterian Church in America. <br>•	Last Sunday Roman Catholics in the United States probably worshipped in more languages than at any previous time in American history. <br>•	Last Sunday the churches with the largest attendance in England and France had mostly black congregations."<br><br><br><b>World Christian Encyclopaedia</b><br><br>Detailed facts and figures as to what happened in the 20th century can be gleaned from the Oxford University Press's new edition of the (huge) World Christian Encyclopaedia (WCE). There you learn that the total number of people classified as Christian grew enormously from 1900 - 2000. In 1900 there were 558 millions while there were 2000 million (33.0% of the world's population) in the year 2000 - with massive growth in the Third World, especially Africa. However, since 1900 there have also been massive defections from Christianity "in Western Europe due to secularism, in Russia and later Eastern Europe due to Communism, and in the Americas due to materialism" <br><br>According to the Encyclopaedia, the number of Christians ... </p>

<blockquote><div>... had increased rapidly during the 'Great Century' from 1815-1914 at a rate of 1.2% per decade, then after 1914 reverted to a catastrophic decline of 0.4% per decade which by 1980 had worsened to 1.0% per decade. Despite this, the absolute number of Christians increases at 25 million a year. Christianity has in fact surged ahead in the world's less-developed countries from 83 millions in 1900 to 1,120 millions by the year 2000. During the 20th century, in fact, Christianity had become the most extensive and universal religion in history. There are today Christians and organized Christian churches in every inhabited country on earth ... In Africa, Christians have mushroomed from 9.9 million in 1900 (0.6% of the world's population then) to 360 million in 2000 (8.9%).The present net increase on that continent is 8.4 million new Christians a year (23,000 a day), of which 1.5 million are net new converts (converts minus defections or apostasies). Sizeable net conversions are also taking place in Asia (2.4 million a year)</div></blockquote>

<p>Sadly, however, losses from Christianity in the Western world over the last 60 years have slightly outweighed these gains. In Europe and North America ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... net defections from Christianity - converts to other religions or to irreligion - are now running at 1,820,500 former Christians a year. This loss is much higher if one considers only church members: 2,224,800 a year (6,000 a day). It is even higher if one is speaking of only church attenders: every year, some 2,765,100 church attenders in Europe and North America cease to be practising Christians within the 12-month period, an average loss of 7,600 every day.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Urban Christianity</b><br><br>Jesus moved from a largely rural and small town setting to that of urban Jerusalem. His disciples then took the gospel for the most part to urban centres. Paul's mission strategy was to target urban centres from which the gospel could spread to surrounding areas. This was especially true for cities such as Antioch, Corinth, Ephesus and Phillipi. <br><br>Throughout the history of Christianity cities have played a key role. The Reformation, for example, was based in mainland Europe on cities such as Wittenberg, Zurich and Geneva and in Britain on Oxford and Cambridge. And when 19th century London developed as the first "world-class city" there were major developments in mission and evangelism resulting, humanly, in phenomenal church growth worldwide. <br><br>From 1400-1700 all the world's five largest cities were non-Christian and even anti-Christian and hostile to Christian missions. By 1800, however, two of the world's five largest cities had become centres of Christian outreach - London and Paris. Then began the century historians have called the "Great Century" when the gospel was preached literally across the world. By 1900 all the five largest cities had become "strongholds of Christian life, discipleship, urban evangelism, urban missions, foreign missions and global missions: in order of size, London, New York, Paris, Berlin and Chicago."<br><br>But by the year 2000 two of the five largest cities were non-Christian. And it is estimated that by 2025 four of the top five will be hostile to the Christian faith, and by 2050, if things progress as at present, four of the top five (Karachi, Bombay, Dhaka and Calcutta) will be non-Christian and even anti-Christian giants of around 40 million each. "The plain facts are that Christians are decreasing as a proportion of all urban dwellers. In this vital area of urbanized life, as expressed in the world's cities, discipling the world's cities as measured by the presence of Christians (the number of baptized or affiliated church members of all confessions) has been declining markedly throughout the twenthieth century. In the year 1800 31% of all urban dwellers in the world were Christians. In 1900 this had risen spectacularly to 69%. Then the tide suddenly turned. Today that proportion has dropped once more to under 40%."<br><br><br><b>The Future</b><br><br>Urbanologists are predicting that the deepening and spreading of information and knowledge will more and more be the world's dominant activity. So the success of cities, it is said, will depend on their ability to pass on their knowledge base from one generation to another; to promote innovation while guiding scarce resources to strategic priorities; and to be people-oriented: old industrial cities have been product-oriented.</p>

<blockquote><div>The existence of a large and dominant middle-class, together with local autonomy, is the critical attribute of progressive cities. In the future, therefore, high priority will likely be given to creating the amenity-rich environments that attract the middle class. Such environments are needed in order to develop, retain and recruit talent required by knowledge-intensive activities. Thus, it is likely that the great industrial cities of the past and present, such as Manchester and Birmingham [and Newcastle] ... will shift to become more people-oriented, and their success will then depend on how attractive their environments are in relation to other cities also competing for knowledge workers. And the critical attribute of success will be leadership, especially the ability to envision the future of world cities and to formulate strategies for their design and development. As for Christian patterns of urban ministry, they will have to be based on and related directly to all of these secular realities" (WCE).</div></blockquote>

<p>Certainly if we judge from other parts of the world, the growth of larger churches where biblical information and knowledge is on offer and the gospel preached will be a key strategy for winning the cities of Britain and Ireland back to Christ. From every perspective, not least that of eternity, such churches are essential "amenities". Perhaps the time has come for a new mission to the cities of Britain and Ireland, with this strategy in mind.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="To Win or Not to Win - a Sermon for the Start of the World Cup">(June 2002) To Win or Not to Win - a Sermon for the Start of the World Cup</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2002</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>

The following is a transcript of the sermon at the Invitation Service at Jesmond Parish Church on 26 May.)</i><br><br><br>Question: when was the fastest goal in the World Cup? Answer: 1962 when Czechoslovakia took only 15 seconds to score against Mexico. Question: when was the earliest sending off in the World Cup? Answer: 1986 when Sergio Batista of Uruguay was sent off after only 56 seconds. If they had been with us tonight, some of the New Testament apostles would have been interested in that useless information.<br><br>That is why I make no apology for talking about sport tonight. As you read the bible some, especially St Paul, seem to be great sport's enthusiasts. On recent Sunday mornings we have been looking at Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. In chapter 9 verses 24-27 he talks in one go about athletics, boxing and fitness training. And in Philippians he talks about chariot racing - the ancient equivalent of motor racing. Well, tonight I want us to focus on a sporting reference in Hebrews and in particular chapter 12 verses 1-3:</p>

<blockquote><div>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</div></blockquote>

<p>And <b><i>first</i></b>, I want to talk about <b>THE COMPETITION</b>, <b><i>secondly</i></b>, about <b>HOW TO WIN</b>, and, <b><i>thirdly</i></b>, about <b>HOW NOT TO WIN</b>.<br><br><br>So, <b><i>first</i>, THE COMPETITION. </b><br><br>The writer to the Hebrews says that life is like a competition - an athletic competition or race. And that is true for each one of us. In verse 1 the writer says there is "the race marked out for us". That means God has a plan for your life and a way for you to go. Many deny that. They say, "I believe that this life is just meaningless." Many believed that when the New Testament was being written. It was the philosopher, the late Bertrand Russell, who said in his autobiography:</p>

<blockquote><div>There is darkness without and when I die there will be darkness within.</div></blockquote>

<p>But the bible says that life is going somewhere. History had a beginning and it will have an end. There was a creation and one day there will be a new heavens and a new earth when Christ returns. In the previous chapter, chapter 11 of Hebrews, we read:</p>

<blockquote><div>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible" (Heb 11:3).</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>Chapter 11 is all about faith, reasonable faith not irrational superstition, faith which is the secret of knowing God, faith that is concerned with the future and with the unseen spiritual world. So you are going somewhere. And there are only two destinies. It is not like when you go on holiday. You go to Newcastle airport and look up at the information board and you see scores of exotic places listed. Life is not like that, says the bible. For on life's information board there are only two destinations, and only two routes you can take. This is how Jesus puts it in his Sermon on the Mount:</p>

<blockquote><div>Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it" (Mat 7:13-14).</div></blockquote>

<p>There is a B class road and a motorway, Jesus is saying. The motorway looks attractive initially, but it leads to destruction. It is the B class road alone that leads to life. And you have a choice. There are people reading this who know that they have to make that choice. Jesus says, "choose the B class road." But you say "that is discrimination - it is to say that one road is right and the other is wrong." Absolutely. The modern world is bewitched by the idea that in and of itself nothing is wrong and nothing is false. And all are winners. But common-sense tells you that life is not like that. <br><br>Africa's finest footballer is Elhadji Diouf. He was raised by his grandmother in a house made of straw but is now a super-star in a French first division team. He has helped Senegal get into the final rounds of the World Cup. But he was only a small boy in 1990. That was the year Senegal missed playing in the World Cup. Why? Because their officials forgot to send in the entry form. Can you imagine it? Yes! Life is like that. There are hard realities. You can miss trains, planes and the World Cup. There is a fundamental discrimination in the competition of life. But that discrimination has nothing to do with the things we rightly abhor - discrimination because of race, colour or wealth. No! It is all to do with whether you are going God's way or going your own way. Nor is that unreasonable. In a long distance race, like the Great North Run, you can start off but then refuse to go south over the Tyne Bridge because you want to run north of the river to Tynemouth. You are free to do so, but you will not get to the finishing line. That is the way life is. And that is the way eternity is. There is a right road and a wrong road. You can live as God wants you to or you can go your own way. But there are consequences. The end of going God's way is heaven. The end of going your way is hell. The bible says:</p>

<blockquote><div>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death" (Prov 14:12).</div></blockquote>

<p>Most people in their heart of hearts know that to be true. And millions have said that quite openly and confidently. Hebrews 12.1 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses.</div></blockquote>

<p>These are people who have proved throughout history that God is real and God is good. So there is a competition.<br><br><br><b><i>Secondly</i>, HOW TO WIN?</b><br><br>Look at verses 2 and 3:</p>

<blockquote><div>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him.</div></blockquote>

<p>Note these words carefully. The writer doesn't say, fix your eyes on Mohammed, or the Buddha, or a New Age Guru, or secular thinkers like Marx, Darwin or Freud. Today it is fashionable to say that every religion or philosophy leads to God in the end. But Hebrews says "No!". The people to whom our writer was writing, like people today, thought that it was very narrow to say that Jesus is the only way. After all that was a bit hard on their old Jewish friends. So they wanted Jesus and Judaism. But Hebrews says in earlier chapters, "No!" Jesus is greater than Moses, greater than the greatest High Priest, greater than any angel, for Jesus is the divine Son - as Christians remind themselves on this Trinity Sunday. <br><br>Of course there is an attraction in saying that all roads lead to God. It means you can live and let live. But if others are going to get messed up by what they believe and then do, how cruel to stand by and just watch. Sadly non involvement is also fashionable today. A woman we know was beaten up on the Metro recently and people just watched. They didn't want to get involved. The writer to the Hebrews wants to get involved for the good of his friends. So he says, Jesus is the only way. It is Jesus Christ alone who is ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... the same yesterday and today and forever" (Heb 13:8).</div></blockquote>

<p>Notice, however, his precise words here in chapter 12 verse 2:</p>

<blockquote><div>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus.</div></blockquote>

<p>He includes himself - "Let us". So a Christian doesn't stand in judgment on the world when he or she says that Christ is the only way. It is, as one great Indian Christian once said, like one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread. But we have to "fix our eyes on Jesus" or, verse 3, you have to "consider him". That is what many do not do. They never consider the reality of Jesus. It was G K Chesterton who famously said that the trouble with many people is not that Christianity has been tried and found wanting; it has not been tried. Many are totally ignorant today of even the simple facts of the bible. When you fix your eyes on Jesus, you see the evidence of his life - a remarkable life. No other religious leader compares with Jesus. Hebrews 5:8-9 says that Jesus Christ ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... learned obedience from what he suffered 9 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</div></blockquote>

<p>There was a perfection in Jesus that has been seen in no other human being. Then there was his death - the source of that eternal salvation. Of course, others have been crucified - a most terrible form of execution. But Christ's death was unique. It dealt with sin. The writer to the Hebrews saw this as the high purpose of Christ's life. Hebrews 1 verse 3 says that Jesus Christ is "the Son ... the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word." Jesus Christ, the second person of the divine Trinity, is the one through whom this whole universe of space and time holds together. So referring to that Christ - not some figment of a liberal theologian's imagination who turns out to be a glorified social worker - no! but referring to that divine and almighty Christ, he then says:</p>

<blockquote><div>... after he had provided purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</div></blockquote>

<p>No other religious leader provides "purification for sins". In this, his atoning death, is Christ's supreme uniqueness. And no other religious leader, after death, rose from the dead, left a tomb empty, ascended to heaven and is at "the right hand of the Majesty in heaven" - reigning and ruling. So you must fix your eyes on Jesus and consider him. He alone is the answer to what is wrong with the world. <br><br>You ask, "what is wrong with the world?" People come up with different answers. Some say it is a shortage of money. In one form that was Marx' view. But some of the greatest evils have been committed by the richest of men. Some say the problem is all to do with your up-bringing, or the frustrations you have over sex, nutrition and power. That was Freud's view. Others say it is because the world has not evolved enough - that is the view of the social Darwinians. Yes, the world is getting better and better, from one perspective. My notes for this sermon prove that. I have used a computer to write them and a printer to print them - legibly. Computers are wonderful. But at the same time, the world is getting worse and worse. My computer also proves that. On Monday afternoon I discovered I had caught the computer virus W32.Klez.H@mm. It corrupted so many of my files. They could only be quarantined. They were unrepairable. It was quickest to reinstall my operating system and then reinstall everything else. But that wasted a huge amount of precious time. Just imagine someone sitting in the back streets of Jakarta, or Johannesburg (or Jesmond) employing a huge amount of mental ability trying to create computer viruses just to make life a misery for thousands - endangering not only businesses but hospitals and other key institutions. That is evidence of what the bible says is the real cause of what is wrong with the world. It is sin or going my way and not God's. And it is like a disease. The bible says it is like ingrained dirt. And God cannot tolerate that.<br><br>This year's World Cup is being held in Korea and Japan. Japan is in the monsoon season, "when the Land of the Rising Sun becomes the land of the Rising Sewer" - as one journalist put it. You can be pretty sure there will be a lot of mud around. It will be like that glorious World Cup Final Day in 1966 - when England won! Bobby Moore was the England captain at the time. Sadly he died young from cancer. But before he died, he was interviewed and the interviewer said: "Bobby, what was it like to receive the Jules Rimez trophy - the World Cup - from Her Majesty the Queen, in front of that huge home crowd at Wembley Stadium?" And Bobby Moore said: "well, frankly it was terrifying." He said,</p>

<blockquote><div>as I was going up the steps to the balcony at Wembley I saw that the Queen was wearing some beautiful white gloves. I then looked at my hands and realized that they were covered in Wembley mud, and I thought 'How can I shake hands with her like this? – I'll make her gloves dirty.</div></blockquote>

<p>And you can still see it on the footage of the replay of that match. There is Bobby Moore as he goes up the steps desperately trying to wipe his hands against his shorts to get them clean. Now, if he was worried that his muddy hands would spoil the white gloves of Her Majesty the Queen, how much more concerned should we worry about approaching God himself. The bible says not that we have muddy hands but muddy hearts. The problem is not on the outside but on the inside. Jesus says:</p>

<blockquote><div>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean'" (Mark 7:21-23).</div></blockquote>

<p>So how can we approach a God who, so to speak, is "white" and clean in his holiness? That's the problem. How can spiritually unclean people approach a clean and holy God. The bible says that is the problem and it can't be dealt with by a superficial solution. It's not a superficial problem. I can't just go and get baptized and think that'll deal with it. I can't just take communion and think that'll deal with it. I can't just come to church on a Sunday and think that'll deal with it. For the problem lies deep within. We have unclean hearts. Christ alone can deal with it. You say, "How?" Well, look at verse 2. It says that Jesus is ...</p>

<blockquote><div>the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God." </div></blockquote>

<p>Sin needs to be cleansed and forgiven, and you need to be changed so that you have the strength to be living a new life. That is why you need Jesus Christ as the "author and perfecter of our faith". On the cross he took your sin, in your place, and bore the penalty you deserve. It is like Mick McArthy, the Ireland manager, who was abused by Roy Keane, coming back home in Roy Keane's place. That is something like what Christ has done on the cross for you. And you need faith to accept his forgiveness and new life and power to overcome your selfish instincts. But the good news is that Christ is the "author and perfecter of our faith". By his Holy Spirit he will give you that faith, forgiveness and new life - if you ask him.<br><br>So that is how we win in the competition or race of life.</p>

<blockquote><div>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b><i>Thirdly</i></b>, and very briefly, <b>HOW NOT TO WIN</b><br><br>It is to do the opposite of all that - to fix your eyes on everything but Jesus, or on everything else and Jesus in the second place. And it is not to do three things our writer tells us to do in verse 1:</p>

<blockquote><div>let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.</div></blockquote>

<p>The English World Cup team can't play in suits. They need much lighter gear. There is nothing wrong in a suit, but it is not for playing football in. There may be things in your life that are quite OK but they prevent you from coming to faith in Christ. These are things that hinder - your career, your house, your hobbies, even your sport - you realize that these will have to take second place, and you want them to come first.<br><br>Then, secondly, there can be something in your life that is not OK that prevents you from coming to faith in Christ. This is the "sin that so easily entangles". It may be an immoral relationship which you know you will have to give up. It maybe your selfishness which you quite enjoy. It maybe something else.<br><br>And then, thirdly, you do not "persevere" or you "grow weary and lose heart" (verse 3). You need to keep going to the final whistle or the tape. And you can do that in Christ's strength. But you have to ask him for it for that strength<br><br>I must <b>conclude</b>. I will do so with three questions and then we'll pray.<br><br>First, are you someone who needs tonight to make that choice of roads? You've been thinking long enough and you know that God is calling you to ignore the crowd on the motorway that leads to destruction and choose that really more attractive B class road that leads to life. Why not say, "Yes!" to God tonight; and by faith as you pray receive the forgiveness and new life that Jesus Christ offers.<br><br>But may be you are someone for whom this is all very new, and you want to know more and start to "fix your eyes on Jesus ... and to consider him". So why not join the Christianity Explored course at JPC? Or why not take from the welcome desk, the little booklet "Why Jesus?" or "The Choice We All Face" - it is about choosing between those two roads.<br><br>Many tonight, however, have already chosen that B class road. So I ask you, "are you persevering"; are you continuing to "throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles". That is something you have to do throughout your Christian life. You will sometimes fail - but, if you confess, Christ will forgive you and give you new strength. Our writer says (Hebrews 4.15-16):</p>

<blockquote><div>we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need" (Heb 4:15-16).</div></blockquote>

<p>So why not approach that "throne of grace" in whatever state you are in and pray for Christ's "mercy and grace to help us in our time of need" - whatever your needs may be.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain">(September 2002) Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2002</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Jesmond Parish Church was founded in 1861 in memory of Richard Clayton. Richard Clayton was the chaplain at St Thomas' Church, Haymarket from 1836 to 1856. He was converted after he was ordained through the ministry of his predecessor at St Thomas', Robert Wasney. From then on, in the words of his friend George Fox of Durham, Clayton tried to live out, and certainly preach, "the three great cardinal truths of the gospel ... a sound conversion to God ... justification of the soul in the sight of God ... and sanctification of the soul." During his period at St Thomas' he exercised a remarkable ministry in Newcastle upon Tyne. Sadly he died relatively young. And Fox, who preached at his funeral, included this in the sermon:</p>

<blockquote><div>The day may not be far distant when within the walls of St Thomas' you shall no longer hear the plain message of gospel truth enforced by the spiritual experience of your minister.</div></blockquote>

<p>He was right. The man appointed to succeed Clayton did not preach "the plain message of gospel truth". The congregation, therefore, planned to establish ...</p>

<blockquote><div>a church in memory of the late Richard Clayton ... in which evangelical truth shall be declared [and which would] form a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth in a large and populous town.</div></blockquote>

<p>There was great support from around the country - such was the interest and concern. There was also opposition locally. But JPC opened its doors in 1861. So, founded in memory of Richard Clayton and required to be known as "Jesmond Church", it had this distinctive twofold mandate. On the one hand it was to ensure the "maintenance" of "evangelical truth" so that it was not distorted either by false teaching from within the church or by the desire to conform to beliefs held outside the church. On the other hand it was to ensure the "promulgation" of the gospel in the wider world.<br><br>But what is "evangelical truth"? It is the truth of the Bible but especially it includes those "3 R's" - ruin, redemption and regeneration. Ruin - all have sinned and rebelled against God, with the consequences for this life and for eternity being dire. Redemption - the good news is that Jesus Christ is the Saviour and only Saviour from sin through his death in our place on the Cross. Regeneration - faith and trust in Christ as Saviour and Lord results not only in forgiveness for sin but a "new birth" by the Holy Spirit with a new concern for God and for others and with the hope of heaven. This is the tradition of Athanasius, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Hooker, Owen, Edwards, Whitefield, Wesley, Spurgeon, and J.C.Ryle. And that is what we are committed to at JPC. This tradition although, of course, not perfect is more faithful (I would argue) to the Bible than other traditions (such as liberal Protestantism or Roman Catholicism). But to focus things for today as an aide-mémoire we have a brief mission statement at JPC, Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain (with the order being important, but all elements inter-relate).<br><br><br><b>Godly Living</b><br><br>First, there is Godly Living. This is based on the first and Greatest Commandment:</p>

<blockquote><div>Jesus [said]: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment" (Mat 22.37-38).</div></blockquote>

<p>There needs to be, therefore, a commitment to our God that is total; and such a commitment is only through Jesus Christ himself (Jn 14.6). This will involve our minds: we need to believe the essential facts of the faith as revealed in the Bible. These are summarized for us in the creeds and developed further in the 39 Articles of our Anglican forefathers. Then it will involve our wills as we seek to be obedient to God's will that is revealed in the Bible. And that is summarized for us in the 10 Commandments and expounded for us by Jesus, the prophets and the apostles. Also it will involve a real sense of need of God's grace at all times for forgiveness and strength. This must lead to prayer, an example and model of which Jesus gave us in the Lord's Prayer. In practical terms, all this should mean that we seek to understand the Bible better as we go on in the Christian life. But we must not only be hearers but also doers. We should be seeking to be obedient to God in every aspect of our lives - and not only on Sunday but also Monday to Saturday. Yes, we should be faithful on Sundays by meeting with other Christians to praise God, hear his word read and preached, pray and make use of the means of grace that include the Lord's Supper (or Holy Communion). But we should be faithful on other days in all we do - at home, at work and at leisure. That means time for personal Bible study and prayer and, if we have children, for helping them to understand the Bible and to learn to pray. And there should be time for others in need.<br><br><br><b>Church Growth</b><br><br>Secondly, there is Church Growth. This is based on the Great Commission:</p>

<blockquote><div>Jesus ... said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age'" (Mat 28.18-20).</div></blockquote>

<p>The goal is disciples, not just decisions. New converts need to learn from the example of the early Christians who "devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer." And they committed themselves financially as well (Acts 2.42,45). They were being formed into a "church". <br><br>Evangelism has to be the priority of people who are seeking to keep the first and Greatest Commandment. The danger of some Evangelicals in the period immediately after the Reformation was that they neglected evangelism and church planting. Some believed that all you needed was to pray and "maintain" the faith against error. William Carey, the Baptist missionary pioneer at the end of the 18th century, said, "No!" God also uses human means and wants us to "promulgate" the faith as well as "maintain" it (it was Carey who said: "attempt great things for God; expect great things from God"). The term "church growth" ensures we do not forget the practical aspects of what happens when God adds to the church "those who [are] being saved" (Acts 2.47). Also it ensures we think about "means" as not primarily individual Christians working alone in evangelism but working together as the body of Christ where there are people with different gifts. It also reminds us that this side of heaven the church is a social reality as well as a spiritual reality - and that social reality has to be worked at, planned and managed.<br><br><br><b>Changing Britain</b><br><br>Thirdly, there is Changing Britain. This is based on the "second commandment". Jesus said (Mat 22.39):<br></p>

<blockquote><div>the second is like [the first]: 'Love your neighbour as yourself'." </div></blockquote>

<p>The first and second commandments are related: "If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen" (1 Jn 4.20). So love for your neighbour begins at home and locally. That is a simple way to start to Change Britain. However, in a democracy, love in the public sphere means justice and doing what is best for society as a whole. And God's will is always best. Hence we should seek God's standards in public life and also take any positive practical initiatives where there is opportunity and need. <br><br>Furthermore we have to pray for our rulers "that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Saviour, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim 2.2-3). That hints that there is a connection between a good social order and evangelism. It is true that if a person is converted and seeks to lead a "godly life", he or she will need to be in a supporting Christian fellowship - that will mean "church growth". But if everything in pagan society is contrary to God's will and laws, it is hard for a new convert. So at JPC we are concerned to "change Britain". We want believers to be able to live and work without compromise. We are also concerned to be "salt and light" in a decaying and dark world. God's way is perfect, not just for believers but for all. Christian love demands we help others as we can and work for God's way in public life.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>We must all be committed to Godly Living. Our involvement in Church Growth and Changing Britain, however, will vary according to our gifts and opportunities. But we can all pray; give (different amounts); say something about Jesus Christ to others; and write letters as necessary about public affairs.<br><br>As we face this Autumn, let's thank God for the heritage we have received. Let's be faithful in handing it on. And let's recommit ourselves to Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="'A Line in the Sand", Reform and Rowan Williams">(October 2002) "A Line in the Sand", Reform and Rowan Williams</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2002</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>In the middle of August I was asked to write a piece for the monthly Christian newspaper Evangelicals Now. I had no particular desire to write. I was persuaded, however, by the editor because of the deepening concern about the blanket welcome being given to Rowan Williams as the next Archbishop of Canterbury in spite of his heterodox views, especially in the area of sexual morality. As I shared this concern, I wrote the following which appeared in the September edition of the paper. It was headed: A LINE IN THE SAND.<br><br>Calvin warned Christians when faced with "open enemies of the truth" they must be careful of "the heat of contention". But they must not "appear to flatter by keeping silence." Many Evangelicals have been silent following the announcement that Rowan Williams is to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury, a man known for his heterodox teachings with regard to basic Christian sex ethics. Others have made muted or ambiguous statements that de facto concede the principle – namely that encouraging sexual immorality is a secondary issue over which Christians are at liberty to disagree. Others have given a positive welcome.<br><br>Mark Ashton, Richard Bewes, Jonathan Fletcher, Angus Macleay, Hugh Palmer, Vaughan Roberts, William Taylor and myself (all incumbents of larger churches) sent an Open Letter to the Prime Minister that publicly opposed the appointment. This was on the grounds that regarding homosexual behaviour Rowan Williams was flying "in the face of the clear teaching of the Holy Scriptures and the resolutions of the Lambeth Conference 1998." Tony Blair courteously replied, particularly remarking that "his appointment has been warmly welcomed by many leading Evangelicals in the Church".<br><br><br><b>Out of proportion?</b><br><br>Perhaps someone is asking: "have we not got this all out of proportion? Is not the Archbishop of Canterbury designate kind, caring, pastoral and orthodox in other areas?" Many have said so. But all pastors or shepherds besides being kind and caring also have to fight the wolf (John 10.12). And wolves, we are told, can come in the form of those within the church who "distort the truth" (Acts 20.30).<br><br>On sex in general Rowan Williams has views that are neo-liberal. He dispenses both with the "simple traditional biblical" teaching and the "conventional wisdom of the right-thinking, liberal-minded person of today." He then says: "Our main question about how we lead our sexual lives should be neither 'Am I keeping the rules?' nor 'Am I being sincere and non-hurtful?' but 'How much am I prepared for this to signify?'" (Open to Judgement, pp161-167). That is a good example of some of his theologizing (and not just in the areas of moral or social ethics). He denies biblical orthodoxy; he also denies the old liberal orthodoxy; and trying to be generous to both positions, he then builds a third neo-liberal way that, whatever else it may be, is another non biblical way.<br><br>What, then, are his views on homosexual sex in particular? He says: "I recognise I am in the minority, so I am cautious of making this a great campaigning issue. [But] I am not convinced that a homosexual has to be celibate in every imaginable circumstance" (Interview, Anglican Media Sydney). Why does he hold this position? He answers: "I think my own developing sense over the last twenty years has come partly from being spiritual director to people of the homosexual orientation … I did come to a point where I could no longer say the biblical account answers all the questions we have or want to ask" (Interview, Anglican Media Melbourne).<br><br><br><b>How do we read the Bible?</b><br><br>So how does Rowan Williams handle the "biblical account". He says:</p>

<blockquote><div>We read neither with a kind of blind and thoughtless obedience to every word of scripture, as if it simply represented the mind of God, nor do we read with that rather priggish sensibility that desires to look down on the authors of scripture as benighted savages. We read with a sense of our own benighted savagery in receiving God's gift, and our solidarity with those writers of scripture caught up in the blazing fire of God's gift who yet struggle with it, misapprehend it, and misread it" (Open to Judgement, p159).</div></blockquote>

<p>The net result of all this is that Rowan Williams is now one of the intellectual leaders associated with gay apologetics in the church world-wide. While not campaigning himself, he thus lends great weight to those who are campaigning. For example, he lends his name to the biannual journal Theology and Sexuality as a member of its editorial board. In the current edition (March 2002) the first three articles are "Men, Muscles and Zombies"; "A Place for Porn in a Gay Spiritual Economy"; and "Finding God in the Heart-Genital Connection: Joe Kramer's Erotic Christianity". "A Place for Porn" is itself utterly pornographic, while "Finding God" is about workshops and retreats that even other gay scholars think are "excuses for sexual orgies" (p41).<br><br><br><b>Misleading my servants</b><br><br>The cameo of the church in Thyatira (Revelation 2.20) makes it quite plain that "teaching" that "misleads my servants into sexual immorality" is a doctrinal line in the sand. It is not a secondary matter. The good Christians of Thyatira were "tolerating" such teaching; and the risen Christ condemned them. That is why there must be prayer either for a real change in the thinking and teaching of Rowan Williams or else for him, somehow, still not to become Archbishop.<br><br>We are, indeed, talking about a church defining issue. It is also of great social importance. In the wider world the legitimising of homosexual sex has been a motor for the destabilizing of the whole of western sexual culture. That destabilization has led to the belief that sexual drives need unfettered expression; the systematic deconstruction of the "married family"; abortions; sexually transmitted diseases; and single parents. The resulting outcomes, as social science is now confirming, are dire for children (especially), but also for adults and society at large. For the church to grant further legitimacy would surely be wicked. Rather the church needs to speak the truth (in love) about Christ, the gospel and his way of living.<br><br><br><b>An impossible situation</b><br><br>The Church of England is being placed in an impossible position. Its canons require that a Bishop (or Archbishop) must "teach and uphold sound and wholesome doctrine and … banish and drive away all erroneous and strange opinions" (C18). But the Archbishop of Canterbury designate seems himself a source of "erroneous and strange opinions". For these are defined by "the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, The Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal" (A5). <br><br>The Ordinal, however, also imposes a duty on every Priest/Presbyter also to "drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's Word." Pray for those of us who are seeking to fulfil that duty.<br><br>I wrote the above in the middle of August. Then in the middle of September the Reform Council, of which I am a member, met. Reform is a campaigning group of evangelical clergy and laity who want to see the Church of England return to its biblical roots. There was agreement over the seriousness of the situation. So the Council issued a statement together with this preamble.<br><br><br><b>The Reform Council ...</b><br><br>... met on 17 September for the first time since the announcement that Rowan Williams was to be the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Council was aware that many Reform members, shocked by this appointment, were looking to the Council for a lead. Whilst intending to continue consultation amongst the whole network of Reform members and to bring these concerns to our national conference next month, the full Council, after its deliberations and in its own right, has agreed to make the following statement:<br><br>"Since the announcement of the Archbishop of Wales, Rowan Williams, as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, we have spent time in further study of his public statements and published writings and in consultation world-wide. We have long been disturbed at the steady growth of unorthodoxy, currently so focused on the growing acceptability of homosexual practice in the Anglo-Anglican churches of the Anglican Communion including the Church of England. Such sexual relations are contrary to the teaching of Scripture, as the General Synod overwhelmingly voted in 1987 and as the Bishops' Issues in Human Sexuality clearly reaffirmed. Accordingly we and others world-wide were deeply dismayed at the appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury of a man who was known for his non-biblical views on homosexual relationships. Even shortly before the appointment he publicly said that he is 'not convinced that a homosexual has to be celibate in every imaginable circumstance' and again we can 'no longer say that the Biblical account answers all the questions we have or want to ask' (Anglican Media, Sydney, 2002). In Open to Judgement (1994 reprinted 2001, page 159) he has said that there are 'writers of Scripture caught up in the blazing fire of God's gift who yet struggle with it, misapprehend it, and misread it'. Furthermore, the retiring Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, has claimed at the recent (and his last) Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Hong Kong that liberal views and policies on homosexuality have led the Anglican Communion to a situation of 'crisis proportions'.<br><br>Therefore:<br><br>1. In view of the publicly expressed opinions of Rowan Williams on homosexual practice, sadly we cannot welcome his appointment as the next Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the world-wide Anglican Communion.<br><br>2. For the avoidance of doubt, and following the Lambeth Conference 1998 Resolution 1.10, where homosexual practice was rejected 'as incompatible with Scripture' and where it was voted that the Conference, 'in view of the teaching of the Scripture, upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in life-long union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called for marriage,' we ask Rowan Williams whether he is willing and able, personally and publicly, to affirm, teach and defend: <br><br>a. The received teaching of the church that all its members are to abstain from sexual relations outside holy (heterosexual) matrimony.<br><br>b. The need for appropriate discipline* within the church where there are sexual relations outside holy (heterosexual) matrimony.<br><br>c. The practice of ordaining only those who themselves will teach, and seek to model in their own lives, the received teaching of the church that all its members are to abstain from sexual relations outside holy (heterosexual) matrimony.<br><br>3. In the light of the teaching of Scripture and in the light of the fact that, as the retiring Archbishop of Canterbury has said at the Anglican Consultative Council (and as we have been saying for 10 years), the Anglican church is being driven 'towards serious fragmentation' due to unorthodox teaching and practice with regard to homosexuality, regretfully we ask Rowan Williams, even at this late stage, if he is unwilling or unable, personally and publicly, to make these affirmations, to withdraw his acceptance of the nomination to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury, for the sake of the Church's gospel witness and unity."<br><br>* 'appropriate discipline' can be exercised by private discussion with the person or persons concerned, by public denunciation of such behaviours when there is no repentance, and, extremely, by church legal action if judged 'appropriate'.<br><br>This statement was sent to Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Wales, on 20 September, with a covering letter from the Reform Council Chairman.<br><br><br><b>Covering letter from the Reform Council Chairman</b><br><br>Dear Archbishop, <br><br>As national Chairman, I have the sad lot of enclosing a statement that the Council of Reform agreed to release after its recent meeting (17 September 2002). The Council found itself sadly unable to be reassured, in mood or mind, by words received or studied over the weeks of the summer. I am personally heavy-hearted that the "iron sharpening iron", of which I wrote in my brief note of 10 August, has had to turn from dialogue to statement. It speaks for itself.<br><br>All I would ask for my part is that you try to understand that, however much you disagree with us (and your letter to me of July 22nd gives me hope that you may understand), we deeply regret having to make this statement. But it is made because we believe that non-Biblical teaching regarding homosexual behaviour (pace your article in The Way Forward?) is a defining issue. We do not believe it is a secondary matter; and we know that there are very many Anglican believers in England and especially around the world as, for example, you will know from the recent meeting of Anglican leaders in Muslim countries, who believe as we do. For us it feels to be a case of "Here we stand; we can do no other". We too are among those who "only believe what every priest in the Church of England believed thirty years ago" and who, as well as your fellow Primates, humbly wish to be allowed to "speak the truth in love" to you.<br><br>Please understand also that our request for you to withdraw, if you cannot make these affirmations personally and publicly, is not motivated personally, but by our concern and Anglican allegiance to seek to be faithful to Scripture and reject "what is not read therein nor can be proved thereby" and by our concern for the good of the Church.<br><br>We will, of course, continue to pray for you. The Lord have mercy on us and on his whole Church. <br><br>Yours sincerely, David Banting.<br><br>On the 23 September, Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Wales, replied to the Reform Council Chairman.<br><br><br><b>Reply from Rowan Williams</b><br><br>Dear Mr Banting, <br><br>Of course I understand that you must do what you believe best for the health of the Church, although it places me in a somewhat difficult position. My personal views are on record, and I have not found reason to change them; not for lack of reflection, believe me. Equally the decision to accept this nomination, not sought by me and not welcome to me, was not taken without reflection and consultation - including consultation with those who would broadly believe as you do: the answers were unanimous. Somehow I have to try and discern the will of God in all this, knowing all too well the risks to the unity of the Church which you mention. But my very conviction that this should not be a defining issue makes it impossible for me to respond as you would want, in all conscience. I can and I do state what is the majority teaching of the Church, and I will exercise the discipline of the Church as I am bound to do. But I can't go beyond this and say that I believe what I do not believe. Nor do I want to set a precedent of publicly affirming more than what the canons require in terms of allegiance to the Scriptures, the Articles and the Creeds.<br><br>I accept that this is not personal, and I appreciate the courtesy and kindness of your letter. I am distressed that this will embitter an already difficult situation, and I join in your prayers for our church.<br><br>Yours in Christ, + Rowan C.<br><br><br><b>Comment</b><br><br>Some may be forgiven for thinking that Rowan Williams is now ready to affirm, teach and defend "the majority teaching of the Church" i.e. the teaching of Lambeth 1998. Indeed, on the BBC Radio 4 Sunday programme on 29 September, Rod Thomas, the Reform Press Officer, was being interviewed by Roger Bolton the presenter, who said at one point: "Well, the Archbishop has said in a letter, I think to one of your colleagues, 'my conviction is that this should not be a defining issue … [but] I can and I do state what is the majority teaching of the church.' Is that enough for you?" No! Rowan Williams is simply saying that he can and does "state what is the majority teaching" (when asked). It does not mean he agrees with it. Indeed, he says: "But I can't go beyond this and say that I believe what I do not believe." <br><br>In his letter to the Primates of the Anglican Communion, sent on 23 July 2002, he made it clear that he personally does not agree with "the mind of the overwhelming majority in the Communion"; but as that is a personal view "he does not have the freedom to prescribe belief for the Church at large". So he will abide by the current discipline of the Anglican Communion (and presumably not ordain gays). In the meantime, while he and his minority still think that gay sex is compatible with Christian discipleship, his "main hope will be to try and maintain a mutually respectful climate for [continuing] reflection, in the sort of shared prayerful listening to Scripture envisaged by Lambeth". But as he has told us, when he listens to Scripture he thinks he hears people sometimes who themselves "misapprehend" and "misread". <br><br>Would anyone ever ask a believer in fox hunting to head up an anti-hunting campaign? He may say, "I can and do state what your views are (when asked) and, for the time being, will not hunt myself." Of course, he would not be appointed. The campaigners want someone who believes in their cause and who will lead enthusiastically, not someone who behind the scenes adds his voice to the pro-hunting lobby and whose main objective is to "maintain a mutually respectful climate for continuing reflection." <br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Of course, if having sex outside marriage - hetero- or homosexual sex - is something over which Christians can legitimately disagree, there may be strong views held, but it is not a matter of life or death. But the Bible says that how you behave in this area is a matter of life or death - eternal life or eternal death: "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor 6.9-11). So, were a prospective Archbishop of Canterbury to say publicly that idolatry, theft, greed, drunkenness, slander or swindling were compatible with Christian discipleship, we would say "please do not become Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and leader of the Anglican Communion." We say the same to a man who says that sexual immorality is compatible with Christian discipleship.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Autumn Christian Institute Lecture">(November 2002) Autumn Christian Institute Lecture</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>November 2002</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>There is no Coloured Supplement in November; instead this month there is the text of David Holloway's Autumn Christian Institute Lecture given on 4 November 2002 at St Stephen's Elswick. The lecture examined the life and theology of Bishop J.C.Ryle, first bishop of Liverpool and the Anglican evangelical leader of the 19th century. The lecture included Ryle's definition of evangelical essentials.<br><br><br><b>Introduction</b></p>

<blockquote><div>One of the most encouraging and hopeful signs I have observed for many a long day in evangelical circles has been a renewed and increasing interest in the writings of Bishop J.C.Ryle.In his day he was famous, outstanding and beloved as a champion and exponent of the evangelical and reformed faith. For some reason or other, however, his name and his works are not familiar to modern evangelicals. His books are, I believe, all out of print in this country and very difficult to obtain second-hand.</div></blockquote>

<p>So wrote Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones in 1956 for the reprint of Ryle's Holiness by James Clarke &amp; Co – Lloyd-Jones being a great leader among non-Anglican Evangelicals during the 1950's.<br><br>Lloyd Jones said that he just happened to "stumble across" Ryle's Holiness in the 1930's in a second-hand bookshop. "I shall never forget the satisfaction – spiritual and mental – with which I read it." He, then, summarizes Ryle and his work like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>The characteristics of Bishop Ryle's method and style are obvious. He is pre-eminently and always scriptural and expository. He never starts with a theory into which he tries to fit various scriptures. He always starts with the Word and expounds it. It is exposition at its very best and highest. It is always clear and logical and invariably leads to a clear enunciation of doctrine. It is strong and virile and entirely free from the sentimentality that is often described as 'devotional'.The Bishop had drunk deeply from the wells of the great classical Puritan writers of the seventeenth century. Indeed, it would be but accurate to say that his books are a distillation of true Puritan theology presented in a highly readable and modern form.</div></blockquote>

<p>Two questions then arise. Why was Ryle not read (and why is he still not read)? During his life time his "tracts" – the papers that in the end made up most of his books and were basically printed sermons – were sold literally all around the world and literally in their millions. Why was it that his near contemporary, Bishop Handley Moule of Durham, suffered a different fate? So why was Ryle not read (and why is he still not read)? That is the first question.<br><br>The second question is simpler and more easy to answer, why should he be read? During the course of this paper I will try to lay the groundwork for a straightforward answer to those questions.<br><br>I want us now to think about J.C.Ryle under the following headings: <b><i>First</i>, RYLE THE MAN; <i>secondly</i>, RYLE THE MINISTER</b>; and, <b><i>thirdly</i>, RYLE THE MISSIONARY</b>.<br><br><br><b><i>First</i>, RYLE THE MAN</b><br><br>So let me tell you something about Ryle the man.<br><br>He died or (to use the words of the title of one of his famous tracts) he went "home at last", aged 85, on 10 June 1900, just over 100 years ago. He was then buried beside his (third) wife (all three had pre-deceased him) at All Saints', Childwall, on the slope of a hill looking south across the Mersey into Cheshire. Childwall, at the time a rural parish, was where Ryle used to go to be quiet and have time off from the pressures of his busy life as the first Bishop of Liverpool. Liz Holgate, a member of Jesmond Parish Church, was a member of All Saints', Childwall and tells of an elderly member of the congregation who could reminisce about J.C.Ryle - her sister had worked for the bishop.<br><br>The Sunday following his death Richard Hobson, a close friend, a clergymen in his diocese and at whose church Ryle and his wife used to worship when free from other engagements, was preaching at the "provisional" cathedral. Hobson spoke of Ryle's greatness in these terms:</p>

<blockquote><div>[he] was great through the abounding grace of God. He was great in stature; great in mental power; great in spirituality; great as a preacher and expositor of God's most holy Word; great in hospitality; great in winning souls to God; great as a writer of Gospel tracts; great as an author of works which will long live, great as a bishop of the Reformed Evangelical Protestant Church of England of which he was a noble defender, great as the first Bishop of Liverpool. I am bold to say that perhaps few men in the nineteenth century did so much for God, for truth, for righteousness, among the English speaking race and in the world as our late bishop.</div></blockquote>

<p>Others agreed that he was one of the greatest of the Victorian evangelicals. His successor at Liverpool was F.J.Chevasse. He described him as "that man of granite, with the heart of a child" – the title of a new biography of J.C.Ryle by Eric Russell. Charles Spurgeon, another of the great Victorian evangelicals described Ryle as "the best man in the Church of England."<br><br>100 years later many believe that Hobson's was a fair assessment. But what makes a "great man"? J.I.Packer says you need at least achievement and "universality". <br><br>In Ryle's case there was the achievement of establishing a brand new diocese (Liverpool had just been split off from Chester when Ryle went there). There was the achievement of his national evangelical leadership. Before going to Liverpool Ryle was a country parson in Suffolk ending up at Stradbroke Parish Church, where he went the year Jesmond Parish Church was founded (1861). While there he was considered the leader of the evangelicals in the Church of England. He led through his preaching and teaching, and travelling considerably. He also led through his other great achievement - his writing. He was a brilliant writer. Unlike many Victorians (and particularly religious writers) he is still readable today. The style is uniquely his own and from a different day to ours. But what he says is crystal clear. <br><br>Then in addition to his achievement Ryle was great because of this quality of "universality". Packer says:</p>

<blockquote><div>Great men impress us as men not simply raised up for their own day, but as men who are there, raised up by God as we Christians would say, for the benefit and the blessing of generations other than their own.</div></blockquote>

<p>Yes, Ryle was a Victorian. And the Victorians have often had a bad press - sometimes rightly and sometimes wrongly. There was the class system and the social structure which we find offensive today. That affected Ryle in a number of ways. Indeed, the existence of social class was the context for one of the defining moments in Ryle's own life.<br><br>Ryle had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was educated at Eton and after Eton at Oxford University, where he excelled both academically and in terms of sport. He was a distinguished classicist. In fact he was one of top three students in his degree year - today, he would have been said to have received a "congratulatory first". He also captained Oxford at cricket - in one university match taking 10 wickets. And he rowed in the university boat race. <br><br>Later in life he claimed that his sporting experience gave him leadership gifts:</p>

<blockquote><div>It gave me a power of commanding, managing, organising and directing, seeing through men's capabilities and using every man in the post to which he was best suited, bearing and forbearing, keeping men around me in good temper, which I have found of infinite use on lots of occasions in life, though in very different matters.</div></blockquote>

<p>However, Oxford was hugely important for Ryle spiritually, especially in his last months at Oxford. He had been made to think about eternity during a period of illness. After he recovered he found himself in a church one Sunday - arriving late! He was just in time for the second bible reading from Paul's letter to the Ephesians. And the lesson reader, we are told, read clearly and distinctly with a pause between each phrase. This may seem artificial to us, but it had a profound effect on Ryle. The words "for by grace ... are ye saved ... through faith ... and that ... not of yourselves ... it is the gift of God" worked in Ryle's life. They went from his head to his heart. He now understood what the gospel of grace and salvation through faith in Christ alone really meant.<br><br>Now, for the context of Ryle's conversion, remember that the year Ryle went up to Oxford was 1834. The University was buzzing with the new Tractarianism – the Anglo Catholic movement that Newman said started with Keble's assize sermon entitled National Apostasy preached in 1833. So Ryle's late arrival at that church and his hearing of the lesson from Ephesians was in the early summer of 1837 – four years later. <br><br>As an aside, the Revd J.W.Diggle who served under Ryle in Liverpool before being consecrated Bishop of Carlisle, used to impress upon his ordinands that "Bishop Ryle owed his conversion to the reading of a lesson in church" – i.e., not by a tract or sermon but the simple reading of the Bible. I am afraid you could also say that Ryle was converted by being late to church – that is what gave impact to the lesson – it was the first thing Ryle heard. My wife, being someone who is always early at events, said that if Ryle had regularly got to church in time he might have been converted earlier in life! Ryle was not the best at time keeping. When later in life he was driven in his carriage to the station to catch the train from the country to London, sometimes people lived in fear and trembling as Ryle was often late and urged the driver to make the horses go faster and faster.<br><br>Be all that as it may, Ryle looked back on his conversion in his Autobiography that he wrote in 1873, nearly 40 years later, and that reviewed his life up to 1860, "in order," he tells us, "that my children may possess some accurate account of my history of life, after I am dead." So, speaking of his conversion, he says:</p>

<blockquote><div>It may interest my children to know what were the points in religion by which my opinions at this period of my life became strongly marked, developed and decided, and what were the principles which came out into strong, clear and distinct relief when this great change came over me … Nothing I can remember to this day appeared to me so clear and distinct as my own sinfulness, Christ's preciousness, the value of the Bible, the absolute necessity of coming out of the world, the need of being born again and the enormous folly of the whole doctrine of baptismal regeneration. All these things … seemed to flash upon me like a sunbeam in the winter of 1837 and have stuck in my mind from that time down to this. People may account for such a change as they like; my own belief is that … it was what the Bible calls "conversion" or "regeneration". Before that time I was dead in sins and on the high road to hell, and from that time I have become alive and had a hope of heaven. And nothing to my mind can account for it, but the free sovereign grace of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>Undoubtedly God had also been working in Ryle's life earlier, not least when he was at Eton. <br><br>Giving this paper at St Stephen's, Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, I ought to mention that while at Eton Ryle was encouraged to try for the Newcastle Scholarship – a divinity prize established by the Duke of Newcastle in 1829. Candidates had to do a detailed study of the Thirty-nine Articles and sit an examination. The top three boys were given a grant of £50 pounds each – which was a lot in those days. Ryle came fourth. He was disappointed, naturally. As at this time he did not show a great interest in Christian things, he probably just wanted the money and the honour. But this piece of study gave him an understanding of Christian doctrine he never had before; and he looked back on the experience as one of the most significant in his life. This is what he wrote later on in his book Knots Untied:</p>

<blockquote><div>It is a simple fact [that] the beginning of any clear doctrinal views I ever attained myself was reading the Articles for the Newcastle Scholarship and attending a lecture at Christ Church, Oxford, on the Articles by my college tutor. I shall always thank God for what I learnt them. Before that time I really knew nothing systematically of Christianity. I knew not what came first or what last. I had a religion without order in my head. What I found good myself, I commend to others.</div></blockquote>

<p>So much for Eton and Oxford. He then went back home to his family's estate in Macclesfield which, as the eldest son, he expected to inherit after making his way in law and politics. His father was not too enamoured of the new convert. Ryle describes this time as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>I was training much and learning much in passing through a school of experience which afterwards was very useful to me. I often think now that my chief fault in those days was that I was too much wrapped up in my own daily spiritual conflict and my own daily difficulties. I did not sufficiently aim at works of active usefulness to the souls of others. At the same time it is but fair to say that it would be hard to point out what work there was that I could have done. Teaching, preaching, visitations, evangelization and such like work were out of the question. As long as I lived under my father's roof they would have been strongly objected to, and would have given great offence. It seems to me as if God intended that period of my life to be one of patient learning and not for active doing.</div></blockquote>

<p>But then something happened. His father's bank crashed. His father became bankrupt losing everything overnight. Here are Ryle's own words:</p>

<blockquote><div>My father was a wealthy man. He was a landed proprietor and a banker. I was the eldest son and looked forward to inheriting a large fortune. I was on the point of entering Parliament. I had all things before me until I was twenty-five. But it then pleased God to alter my prospects in life through my father's bankruptcy. We got up one summer's morning with all the world before us as usual and went to bed that evening completely and entirely ruined.</div></blockquote>

<p>This had a profound effect on Ryle. Writing twenty-five years later he said:</p>

<blockquote><div>With all the world before me [I] lost everything and saw the whole future of my life, turned upside down and thrown into confusion. If I hadn't been a Christian at that time, I do not know if I should not have committed suicide. As it was, everybody said how beautifully I behaved, how resigned I was, what an example of contentment I was. Never was there more a complete mistake. God alone knows how the iron entered into my soul; how my whole frame - body, mind and spirit - reeled and was shaken to the foundation under the blow of my father's ruin. I am quite certain it inflicted a wound on my body and mind, of which I feel the effects most heavily at this day and shall feel it if I live to be a hundred. To suppose that people do not feel things because they do not scream and yell and fill the air with their cries is simple nonsense.</div></blockquote>

<p>And he felt it very badly:</p>

<blockquote><div>The plain fact was there was no one of the family whom it touched more than it did me. My father and mother were no longer young and in the downhill of life; my brothers and sisters, of course, never expected to live at Henbury [their family home] and naturally never thought of it as their house after a certain time. I, on the contrary, as the eldest son, twenty-five, with all the world before me, lost everything, and saw the whole future of my life turned upside down and thrown into confusion.</div></blockquote>

<p>It was not only the sadness and the normal sense of loss that people can understand today. In Victorian society and particularly due to a bank collapse, there was the disgrace, although Ryle had no hand in the collapse. Writing 30 years later Ryle speaks of the "humiliation" of having to leave Henbury – this great estate:</p>

<blockquote><div>I do not think that there has ever been a single day in my life for thirty years that I have not remembered the great humiliation of having to leave Henbury. During that thirty-two years I have lived in many houses and been in many positions. I have always tried to make the best of them and to be cheerful in every circumstance, but nothing has made me forget my sudden violent expulsion from Cheshire in 1841 … Ever since I left Cheshire I have never felt at home, but a sojourner and a dweller in a lodging.</div></blockquote>

<p>Partly this was because he needed now to earn his living – for the first time ever - which for him meant ordination and working in country parishes, initially for a short time in the Winchester Diocese and then for most of his ministry in the Norwich Diocese – for thirty-nine years in all; and then for the last twenty years of his life in Liverpool as Bishop. All that time he had to live in "tied" houses – that went with the job and that he did not own personally.<br><br>So this is the man. Packer describes him as:</p>

<blockquote><div>massive (nearly six feet four and strong as a horse, though he confessed to needing much sleep), and his brains, energy, vision, drive, independence, clear head, kind heart, fair mind, salty speech, good sense, contempt for stupidity, firmness of principle and freedom from inhibitions, not to mention an awesome personal aloofness, would have made him a formidable leader and manager in any field. A deep though private conversion experience when he was twenty-one, together with the subsequent traumas of poverty, family shame and the chronic illness and death of two wives over a period of fifteen years, gave him an uncommon measure of authority when he spoke of Christ's power to meet human need.</div></blockquote>

<p>I have the Vanity Fair picture of Ryle dated 26 March 1881 in my study at Eslington House, Jesmond. He does look massive. Actually I was lectured at Oxford by his grandson, the philosopher Gilbert Ryle – sadly someone not known as a Christian, but someone who had his grandfather's gift for simplicity and clarity. He too was massive and seemed to come from the same stock.<br><br>Before we leave the subject of Ryle the man, something must be said of his family life.<br><br>After his short period of work in Hampshire, first in Exbury then in Winchester itself, Ryle found himself in Helmingham in Suffolk and a parish of 300 people. He would be earning there £500 a year – those were the days when there were wide differentials in clergy salaries. This was very attractive to someone like Ryle, with his Victorian and upper class attitudes. It would allow him to marry. Ryle, however, was never sure whether he had done the right thing in leaving his town church in Winchester. He later wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>Of all the steps I ever took in my life to this day I feel doubts whether the move was right or not. I sometimes think it was want of faith to go, and I ought to have stayed.</div></blockquote>

<p>But he went and he soon married. He had read the lives of the Evangelicals of the 18th century and seen how some of them had had unhappy marriages – for example, John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield. So he was going to take special care. He had three criteria for the choice of a wife. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>The great thing I always desired to find was a woman who was a Christian, who was a real lady, and who was not a fool. Whether I was successful or not, others must judge better than I can, but I call God to witness these were the three points I always kept steadily in view.</div></blockquote>

<p>And it was "always" because he married three times. First, at Helmingham, he married Matilda – a woman who clearly fitted all the criteria – on 29 October 1845. Within a year Georgina was born but within a few weeks Matilda was seriously ill and died on 18 June 1847. They were married for under two years. Three years later on 21 February 1850 he married Jessie, another woman who fitted all the criteria. But within sixth months of the marriage, she, too, became ill and hardly recovered over the 10 years of their marriage. Eventually dying on 19 May 1860 she left Ryle with three sons, Reginald, Herbert and Arthur, and another daughter, Isabelle. Within eighteen months of her death, Ryle married, yet again, Henrietta - according to Eric Russell, "a lady of good birth, highly respected, well educated and a woman with a strong personal faith". Ryle married her on 24 October 1861 and they lived happily together for many years, she being a good mother to his children. She was also an accomplished musician and an expert in the new art of photography. <br><br>Ryle's marriage to Henrietta coincided with his move from Helmingham to Stradbroke in 1861, one of the richest livings in the Diocese with an income of £1,050 a year. <br><br>Just consider, at the very same time (1861) the founders of Jesmond Parish Church, where I come from, lodged with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (as they were then called) £1000 for the entire living of JPC – that is to say it was money to be invested. So only the returns on the money would provide an income for the vicar of Jesmond. And in those days his stipend was considered to be a good one. <br><br>So Stradbroke meant a lot of money for Ryle. But Ryle could now marry comfortably (in terms of his own background and expectations) and send one of his son's to Repton and the other two to Eton. It ought to be added, however, that during his lifetime, Ryle was continually still trying to pay off the debts incurred by his father's bankruptcy.<br><br>So what was Ryle's home life like? Archdeacon James, one time headmaster of Malvern, and a school friend of Reginald and Herbert, recalled one of his visits to Stradbroke vicarage during the school holidays:</p>

<blockquote><div>Mr Ryle, with his gigantic and stentorian voice, was perhaps rather formidable to a youthful visitor, but he was very kind and hearty, and I soon felt at home … The atmosphere of the home was, like that of my own home, devotional, daily Bible readings, somewhat lengthy family prayers, and a good deal of religious talk. But it was all quite wholesome and unpretentious, and I don't think any of us were bored, much less cavil at the regime, at any rate at that time.</div></blockquote>

<p>But life was not at all comfortable for Ryle, as may be gathered. Certainly while at Helmingham life was very hard because of his wife's illness. Listen to this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Few can have any idea how much wear and tear and anxiety of mind and body I had to go through for at lest five years before my wife died. I very rarely ever slept out of our own house, in order that I might be in the way if my wife wanted anything. I have frequently in the depth of winter driven distances of twelve, fifteen, twenty or even thirty miles in an open carriage to speak or preach, and then returned home the same distance immediately afterwards, rather than sleep away from my own house. As to holidays, rest and recreation in the year, I have never had any at all; while the whole business of entertaining and amusing the three boys in an evening devolved entirely upon me. In fact the whole state of things was a heavy strain upon me, both in body and mind, and I often wonder how I lived through it.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ryle was undoubtedly schooled in the school of suffering; and this undoubtedly confirmed his faith in the sovereignty of God. He came to the view that "to feel trouble freely and yet submit to it patiently is what is required of a Christian."<br><br>This is how he could write about his experience of the collapse of his father's bank and the consequences:</p>

<blockquote><div>I have not the least doubt it was all for the best. If my father's affairs had prospered and I have never been ruined, my life, of course, would have been a very different one. I should have probably gone into Parliament very soon and it is impossible to say what the effect of this might have been upon my soul. I should have formed different connections, and moved in an entirely different circle. I should never have been a clergyman, never have preached, written a tract or book. Perhaps I might have made shipwreck in spiritual things. So I do not mean to say at all, that I wish it to have been different to what it was.</div></blockquote>

<p>However, he then added these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>All I mean to say is that I was deeply wounded by my reverses, suffered deeply under them, and I do not think I have recovered body and mind from the effect of them.</div></blockquote>

<p>He wrote all that at Stradbroke and after he was happily married to a woman who was robust and stayed alive!<br><br>So much for Ryle the man.<br><br><br><b><i>Secondly</i>, RYLE THE MINISTER</b><br><br>Next we need to think about Ryle the minister.<br><br>First, there was his preaching. Unlike Spurgeon, who I read regularly but find difficult, Ryle is simple and clear. Ryle was not only a clear writer because he was a clear thinker, he also studied to be clear.<br><br>In his early days at Winchester he spoke of his sermons being … </p>

<blockquote><div>… far too florid, and far less simple and direct than I afterwards found valuable. Nevertheless, they were thoroughly evangelical and being well composed and read with a great deal of earnestness and fire. I have no doubt they sounded very fine and effective, but I should not wish to preach them now.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>In his book The Upper Room there is a paper entitled "Simplicity in Preaching". It was a paper given to clergy much later in St Paul's Cathedral and is still worth reading. It expresses Ryle's mature views. He made five substantial points.<br><br>First, "have a clear view of the subject upon which you are going to preach." <br><br>Secondly, "try to use in all your sermons, as far as you can, simple words."<br><br>Thirdly, "take care to aim at a simple style of composition." <br><br>Fourthly, "use a direct style." [i.e. using "I" and "you" and not "we"]<br><br>Fifthly, "use plenty of anecdotes and illustrations." <br><br>So what was Ryle's own preaching really like?<br><br>He certainly wanted it to be Christ centred:</p>

<blockquote><div>If there is no salvation excepting by Christ we must not be surprised if ministers of the gospel preach much about him. They cannot tell us too much about the name which is above every name. We cannot hear of him too much. We may hear too much about controversy in sermons, we may hear too much of works and duties, of forms and ceremonies, of sacraments and ordinances, but there is one subject which we never hear to o much of, we can never hear too much of Christ.</div></blockquote>

<p>But how did people respond to his preaching? A journalist once attended a service at Helmingham and reported as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>The sermon was one of the longest we have met with, but the earnestness of the preacher's manner and ever ready flow of ideas, the simple yet forceful language and the wonderfully apt and forceful illustrations made the time pass very pleasantly, and we, who for that time at least had no pudding to be spoiled, were almost sorry when he concluded.</div></blockquote>

<p>And Ryle usually ended with a note of practical application. For example, in part of his conclusion in The Best friend, which you can read in his book Practical Religion, Ryle says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>If Christ is your friend, you have great privileges, and ought to walk worthy of them. Seek every day to have closer communion with him, who is your friend, and to know more of his grace and power. True Christianity is not merely believing a certain set of dry abstract propositions; it is to live in daily personal communication with an actual living person – Jesus the Son of God. 'To me,' said Paul, 'to live is Christ' (Phil.1 :21). Seek every day to glorify your Lord and Saviour in all your ways.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ryle saw steady but not spectacular growth throughout his ministry. But any lack of response saddened him, but he did not despair. In a sermon he preached in Chester Cathedral in 1878, two years before moving to Liverpool, he said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>That grand bell in St Paul's Cathedral, London, had struck the hour for many years. The roar and din of traffic in the streets have a strange power to deaden its sound, and prevent men hearing it. But when the daily work is over, and desks are locked and doors are closed, and books are put away, and quiet reigns in the city, the case is altered. As the old bell at night strikes eleven, and twelve, and one and two and three, thousands hear it who never heard it during the day. So I hope it will be with many a one in the matter of his soul. Now, in plenitude of health and strength, in the hurry and whirl of business, I fear the voice of your conscience is often stifled and you cannot hear it. But the day may come when the great bell of conscience will make itself heard, whether you life it or not.</div></blockquote>

<p>But Ryle's services were not just lectures. He was a great lover of singing. He published collections of hymns. Spiritual Songs was his first collection of hymns for use at cottage meetings. There were then two more collections, Hymns for the Church on Earth, selected for the use of the sick and lonely, and The Additional Hymnbook for general use. In the Preface to this collection he writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>I strongly hold that holy thoughts often abide for ever in men's memories under the form of poetry, which pass away and are forgotten under the form of prose.</div></blockquote>

<p>He also comments on the increasing popularity of hymns in Christian meetings, saying:</p>

<blockquote><div>I regard with deep satisfaction the growing taste for hymn singing and praise, as an essential part of Christian worship. It is the healthiest signs of our times … Nothing is so likely to heal 'our unhappy divisions', and to make us of 'one mind' as an increased spirit of praise as well as prayer.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ryle would like to have thought his ministry was in line with the great Puritans. He had a great respect for Richard Baxter, the prince of puritans and rector of Kidderminster, famous for his The Reformed Pastor. Of him Ryle said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>While others were entangling themselves in politics, and burying their dead amidst the potsherds of earth, Baxter was living a crucified life, and daily preaching the Gospel. I suspect he was the best and wisest pastor that an English parish ever had, and a model that many a modern rector or vicar would do well to follow.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ryle's general assessment of the Puritans he sought to learn from was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>With all their faults, weaknesses and defects, [they] alone kept the lamp of pure evangelical religion burning in the times of the Stuarts; they alone prevented Laud's Popish inclinations carrying England back into the arms of Rome. It was they who fought the battle of religious freedom, of which we are reaping such fruits. It was they who crushed the wretched spirit of inquisitorial persecution which misguided High Churchmen tried to introduce into this land. Let us give them the honour they deserve.</div></blockquote>

<p>And Ryle was a great believer in visiting. In his paper on Simplicity in Preaching he tells of …</p>

<blockquote><div>… a humble country clergyman was once asked whether he studied the fathers [meaning the Early Church Fathers] to which the worthy man replied that he had little opportunity of studying the fathers as they were generally in the fields when he called. But he studied the mothers more because he found them at home and could talk to them. Wittingly or unwittingly, the good man hit the nail right on the head. We must talk to our people when we are out of church if we would understand how to preach to them when they are in church.</div></blockquote>

<p>So what was Ryle's ministry like in reality – with his major work being done at Stradbroke? A contemporary sums it up like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>In parish work he was practical and thorough, taking great interest in the temporal as well as the spiritual welfare of his parishioners. Three services on Sundays, meetings during the week at different places. Well-attended, bright and hearty congregational singing, service plain and forcible, rarely concluded without some words to boys and girls in the congregation. Ryle urged parents to bring young children. Some twenty or thirty years ago (Stradbroke was one of the worst places in the neighbourhood) a respectable person could hardly ride through without being insulted or very likely his hat would be knocked off his head. Now a quieter and more orderly parish is hardly found.</div></blockquote>

<p>Ryle the man, Ryle the minister and, finally, Ryle the missionary.<br><br><br><b><i>Thirdly</i>, RYLE THE MISSIONARY</b><br><br>You may think that is a strange description. But Ryle was a missionary. He was concerned to see people converted and then built up in the faith – he wanted in today's jargon, not just decisions but disciples – in his terms justification and sanctification. Packer speaks of Ryle's agenda and that he …<br></p>

<blockquote><div>… aimed at four things: the evangelising of English people; the purging of the English national Church; the uniting of English Christians; and the holiness of English believers.</div></blockquote>

<p>His standpoint was unashamedly evangelical. From the 1850's Ryle became nationally known for his uncompromising evangelical position and his expository preaching, and not only in Norwich diocese. That was through his attendance at meetings in London and preaching in London. But he was especially known for his tracts and then his larger publications. And the major part of this literary work was completed during the period he was at Stradbroke.<br><br>"Tracts" were more than brightly coloured leaflets with a few texts. They were serious short papers and were already famous through the Oxford Movement with Newman and Keble and Pusey, who were known as "The Tractarians". Ryle saw the potential. So these tracts were the main vehicle of Ryle's missionary work. He began to adapt his sermons into tracts with suitably striking titles, 'Have you a Priest?' 'Do you want a Friend?' 'Are you Happy?' Before long Ryle's name was widely known both in Britain and throughout the world. Millions of copies of his tracts were produced and then formed and bound into collections called Home Truths. Subsequently they formed parts of other works. <br><br>His first tract had a tragic origin and was literally 'a tract for the times'. On 9 May 1845 a large crowd had gathered for the official opening of a new suspension bridge in Great Yarmouth. The bridge suddenly collapsed during the ceremony and over a hundred people were thrown into the water and drowned. The disaster shocked the whole country and Ryle took the opportunity to write a pamphlet on the theme of life's uncertainties and God's sure provision of salvation in Christ. Thousands of copies were sold.<br><br>Let Ryle summarize his major writings himself. I am going to give an extended quotation from Ryle's own Preface to Practical Religion – a collection that first appeared in 1878:</p>

<blockquote><div>The volume now in the reader's hands is intended to be a companion to two other volumes which I have already published, entitled Knots Untied and Old Paths.Knots Untied consists of a connected series of papers, systematically arranged, about the principal points which form the subject of controversy among Churchmen in the present day. All who take interest in such disputed questions as the nature of the Church, the Ministry, Baptism, Regeneration, the Lord's Supper, the Real Presence, Worship, Confession, and the Sabbath, will find them pretty fully discussed in Knots Untied.Old Paths consists of a similar series of papers about those leading doctrines of the gospel, which are generally considered necessary to salvation. The inspiration of Scripture, sin, justification, forgiveness, repentance, conversion, faith, the work of Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit, are the principal subjects handled in Old Paths.The present volume contains a series of papers about "practical religion", and treats of the daily duties, dangers, experience, and privileges of all who profess and call themselves true Christians. Read in conjunction with another work I have previously put out, called Holiness, I think it will throw some light on what every believer ought to be, to do, and expect.One common feature will be found in all the three volumes. I avow it frankly at the outset, and will not keep it back for a moment. The standpoint I have tried to occupy, from first to last, is that of an Evangelical Churchman.I say this deliberately and emphatically … After 40 years of bible reading and praying, meditation and theological study, I find myself clinging more tightly than ever to "evangelical" religion, and more than ever satisfied with it. It wears well; it stands the fire. I know no system of religion which is better. In the faith of it I have lived for the third of a century, and in the faith of it I hope to die.The plain truth is, that I see no other ground to occupy, and find no other rest for the sole of my foot. I lay no claim to infallibility, and desire to be no man's judge. But the longer I live and read, the more I am convinced and persuaded that Evangelical principles are the principles of the Bible, of the Articles and Prayer-book, and of the leading Divines of the reformed Church of England.</div></blockquote>

<p>But what did Ryle mean by "evangelical" religion? This is what he says in Knots Untied. He writes of its "leading features":<br><br>"These I consider to be five in number.<br><br>a) The first leading feature of Evangelical Religion is the absolute supremacy it assigns to Holy Scripture, as the only rule of faith and practice … Show us anything plainly written in that Book, and, however trying to flesh and blood, we will receive it, believe it, and submit to it. Show us anything, as religion, which is contrary to that Book, and, however specious, plausible, beautiful, and apparently desirable, we will not have it at any price … Here is rock: all else is sand.<br><br>b) The second leading feature in Evangelical Religion is the depth and prominence it assigns to the doctrine of human sinfulness and corruption … All men … are not only in a miserable, pitiable, and bankrupt condition, but in a state of guilt, imminent danger, and condemnation before God. They are not only at enmity with their Maker and have no title to heaven, but they have no will to serve their Maker, no love to their Maker, and no meetness for Heaven … Hence we protest with all our heart against formalism, sacramentalism, and every species of mere external or vicarious Christianity. We maintain that all such religion is founded on an inadequate view of man's spiritual need. It requires nothing less than the blood of God the Son applied to the conscience, and the grace of God the Holy Ghost entirely renewing the heart … Next to the Bible, as its foundation, it [i.e. evangelical religion] is based on a clear view of original sin.<br><br>c) The third leading feature of Evangelical Religion is the paramount importance it attaches to the work and office of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the nature of the salvation which he has wrought out for man … All who believe on Him are, even while they live, completely forgiven and justified from all things – are reckoned completely righteous before God … We hold that an experimental [i.e. experiential] knowledge of Christ crucified and interceding, is the very essence of Christianity, and that in teaching men the Christian religion we can never dwell too much on Christ himself, and can never speak too strongly of the fullness, freeness, presentness, and simplicity of the salvation there is in him for every one that believes … We say that life eternal is to know Christ, believe in Christ, abide in Christ, have daily heart communion with Christ, by simple personal faith, and that everything in religion is useful so far as it helps forward that life of faith, but no further.<br><br>d) The fourth leading feature in Evangelical Religion is the high place which it assigns to the inward work of the Holy Spirit in the heart of man … We maintain that the things which need most to be pressed on men's attention are those mighty works of the Holy Spirit, inward repentance, inward faith, inward hope, inward hatred of sin, and inward love to God's law … We hold that, as an inward work of the Holy Ghost is a necessary thing to man's salvation, so also it is a thing that must be inwardly felt … there can be n o real conversion to God, no new creation in Christ, no new birth of the Spirit, where there is nothing felt and experienced within … We insist that where there is nothing felt within the heart of a man, there is nothing really possessed.<br><br>e) The fifth and last leading feature in Evangelical Religion is the importance which it attaches to the outward and visible work of the Holy Ghost in the life of man … The true grace of God is a thing that will always make itself manifest in the conduct, behaviour, tastes, ways, choices and habits of him who has it. It is not a dormant thing … To tell a man he is "born of God," or regenerated, while he is living in carelessness or sin, is a dangerous delusion … Where there is the grace of the Spirit there will always be more or less fruit of the Spirit … where there is nothing seen, there is nothing possessed."<br><br>Well, there is Ryle the man, the minister and the missionary.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>I have said nothing about Ryle the bishop. That is because Ryle was not perfect. I try to make all the staff at JPC read one of the original papers in Knots Untied (now reprinted in Warnings to the Churches) entitled "The Fallibility of Ministers". His argument is that the bible alone is infallible. Christian leaders can fail and do fail. "The Reformers were honoured instruments in the hand of God for reviving the cause of truth on earth. Yet hardly one of them can be named who did not make some great mistake."<br><br>Another of Ryle's books that I reread every year and try to get as many others to read, as I can, is Christian Leaders of the 18th Century. Those men were remarkable. But two of them, Ryle reminds us, "abused each other in most shameful language" – he is referring to Wesley and Toplady.<br><br>And Ryle made mistakes as a Bishop in Liverpool – not doctrinal mistakes but managerial mistakes. It would take another paper to explain. In simple terms Ryle saw more than most the need for biblical truth and the recovery of biblical truth. He was less clear in seeing, or being aware of, the need for leadership skills; for an understanding of the dynamics of large organizations such as the new diocese of Liverpool; and for strategizing as urban development mushroomed. Ryle could lead remarkably in a small environment using his own personality and personal gifts. But in a large diocese and trying to motivate people indirectly as well as directly was another matter. To be fair on Ryle, many other bishops in the Church of England probably did far worse. The root problem was the problem that is with us now in the Church of England – the Church was getting so comprehensive that it was getting unmanageable, with ritualists and liberals defying the unifying theology of the Articles and the Prayer Book.<br><br>But, of course, he did much good work in Liverpool. His significant work, however, undoubtedly came through his writing and most of this was completed at Stradbroke.<br><br>Finally, those two questions. First, why was Ryle not read and why is he still not read?<br><br>And, secondly, and more simply and more easily answered, why should he be read now?<br><br>Why was he not read? Answer – too many evangelicals in the Church of England were captured by the 19th century second blessing movement of instant holiness, to which Ryle's Holiness was both a protest and an answer; then many middle of the road Anglicans were captured by a liberal theology that surrendered the authority of the bible to the authority of human reason; and old-fashioned high Churchmen were captured by a Romanizing Anglo-catholicism that surrendered the authority of the bible to the authority of the visible church and church tradition. Ryle was a lone voice crying in the wilderness. He was felt to be out or touch.<br><br>He is still not read for the same reasons. The bible by too many is no longer held as a supreme authority.<br><br>Why should he be read? Because the bible is our supreme authority and Ryle is a brilliant expositor of Biblical religion and a brilliant expositor of the Bible itself. If you doubt that, start reading his Expository Thoughts on the Gospels.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="After Death">(December 2002) After Death</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2002</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>"Do not worry"</b><br><br>We live in a troubled world. None of us is immune from the stresses of life. Jesus himself experienced stress. At times he was extremely distressed. People weeping when his friend Lazarus died was more than he could bear (John 11.33). Thoughts of his own death troubled him (John 12.27). There was nothing unnatural about Jesus' own response to death. And he was troubled at the knowledge that one of his own group of disciples would betray him (John 13.21). John says he was "troubled in spirit".<br><br>But Jesus does not want us to be troubled. In his last supper talk with his disciples he said, "Do not let your hearts be troubled" (John 14.1). He didn't want and he doesn't want his followers to be unnecessarily worried. He was reported as saying in the Sermon on the Mount, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself" (Matt. 6.34).<br><br>However, we need to note that Jesus doesn't promise that the future will be trouble free. The world of "tomorrow" is not seen as an easier world. "Tomorrow" will not necessarily bring release from troubles. But these troubles do not have to invade our hearts. But how do you stop them doing so? Norman Vincent Peale tells people to "put all their cares in the waste-paper basket at the end of the day, just like a man cleaning out all his pockets and throwing into the basket all the unnecessary bits and pieces." But unless you believe that someone is going to dispose of all the rubbish, it will stay there to haunt you. It is all very well saying, "Don't worry" or "Don't be troubled". But how do you stop?<br><br>Immediately after Jesus had told his disciples not to let their hearts be troubled, he said, "Believe in God." They were to have their eyes fixed on their loving heavenly Father. They needed to know that God was their creator. In the Sermon on the Mount when he was talking about worry, he had argued that, if God has already put us on this earth, he can look after us. If God watches over the birds and the flowers, of course, he will watch over us (Matt. 6.25-34). So Jesus said: "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God."<br><br><br><b>"I am going to prepare a place"</b><br><br>But Jesus says something more is needed. A general belief in the sovereignty of God is good but not enough, if we are to overcome worry and anxiety. Jesus said, according to John, that we need quite specifically to believe in him. "Trust in God, trust also in me." Why?<br><br>The problem for the disciples at the time was that Christ had indicated he would soon die. Their worries had to do with his death. Perhaps some of them thought they might die too. They clearly did not understand all Jesus was saying. But talk of death was in the air. Peter had just said that he would be willing to "lay down" his life for Jesus (John 13.37). So Jesus proceeds to give some teaching on how to face death without the wrong sort of worry.<br><br>A consultant surgeon once said to me, "I don't know what to say to people about to die." How sad! Today many people don't know how to face death. It wasn't no different in the ancient world. Aristotle had said: "Now death is the most terrible of all things, for it is the end." The world was a world without hope. But when the Christian gospel of the resurrection from the dead was preached, a new hope came into the ancient world. It was so often "hope" that marked off the Christians. When someone from the pagan world wanted to quiz a Christian on what they believed, it was their "hope" that they wanted to know about. So the early Christians were told to "be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have" (1 Pet. 3.15).<br><br>Part of this hope, which meant that death could now be faced, came from Jesus telling his disciples where he was going. This teaching enabled them to face death without worry. So he says: "I am going ... to prepare a place for you" (John 14.2). What exactly does that mean?<br><br>Well, it certainly speaks of the separation of Jesus from his disciples in the immediate future. But the word "prepare" suggests that their parting will not be for ever. It will only be temporary. Some of his disciples had gone on to "prepare" the room where Jesus now was having his last supper. Then the rest had joined them when all was ready. In the same way Jesus has gone on, he seems to say, to prepare a place for his followers. In time they will join him. This separation implies a reunion. John Stott writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>So Jesus bids us think of death not as a leap into the dark unknown, but as a journey to a prepared place. It will not be like arriving in a strange town in a foreign land, where you know nobody, nobody is expecting you and you haven't even made a hotel reservation. No! Just as Jesus had sent two of his disciples ahead into the city to prepare for him to eat the Passover (Mark 14.12-15), so now he would go ahead to prepare for them.</div></blockquote>

<p>Did Jesus say anything more about where he was going? Yes! He was specific. He spoke of the "place" as being "in my Father's house" where there "are many rooms" (John 14.2). What were these "many rooms"? Probably the reference is to "lodging places" where travellers in New Testament times could find rest and security at night. So Jesus is suggesting that he is going to a place of rest and security, and such a place awaits us the other side of death. And there is a lot of space. There are "many rooms". The Bible, far from suggesting that heaven is only to be peopled by a tiny remnant, says that it will be peopled by "a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language" (Rev. 7.9).<br><br>And Jesus did not only say he was going "to prepare a place". He then said, "if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am" (John 14.3). He has gone on but promised to come back. And he will come back, in person, and then take us with him. We won't have to go it alone. He will be by our side. This is what he seems to be saying. When will that be? The first answer is, "at his second coming." But surely this promise can also be seen to apply to our own deaths. It can be said that at that time Christ comes to take us to himself. And where exactly will we go? To be with Christ. "I will ... take you to be with me." "Christ is our destination as well as our escort."<br><br><br><b>Life after death</b><br><br>Who wants to know what is the essential New Testament teaching about the future life? Here it is! If you are a Christian and you want to know about your final state after the resurrection at the last day, the answer is here. If you are a Christian and want to know about the intermediate state, the state between death and the resurrection, the answer is here. Both states are spoken of as being "with Christ" or "with the Lord", for Jesus takes us to himself.<br><br>This was Paul's teaching. When he was speaking of the intermediate state as he saw it, he said that he had a "desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far" (Phil. 1.23). But then he spoke of the final state in these words, "so we will be with the Lord forever" (1 Thess. 4.17). That is the main thing we kneed to know.<br><br>There is a story told of a doctor visiting a patient's home. He used to take his dog around with him. He left the dog downstairs on this visit. Upstairs was a man who was dying. "What is heaven like?" asked the man. "I don't know," replied the doctor who happened to be a convinced Christian. But at that moment he heard his dog scratching at the door of the patient's room. It gave him an idea. "Can you hear my dog?" "Yes." "He has no idea what is in this room. He has simply heard my voice and come up the stairs to find me. He knows I am here and wants to find me." He went on, "Heaven perhaps is like that. Jesus is there but we don't know what is inside the room! My dog wants to come in here because I am here. Similarly we can look forward to going to heaven, because Jesus is there."<br><br>We can know something of heaven. There will be full personal existence. The empty tomb is a denial of some shadowy "soul survival". There will be a true resurrection of which Christ is the "firstfruits". And we know enough about heaven. We no longer have to live with doubts and uncertainties like the believers in Old Testament times, for Christ not only "destroyed death", he has "brought life and immortality to light through the gospel" (2 Tim. 1.10). As Murray Harris writes: "only with the death and resurrection of Christ did the ideas of resurrection and immortality emerge from Old Testament shadows into the full light of New Testament day."<br><br>That is why meditating on the resurrection of Jesus and all that goes with it is a comfort in death. When Paul himself was in prison and facing the prospect of death, it was the resurrection of Jesus that was one of the things uppermost in his mind. In the Pastoral epistles to Timothy we have what looks like Paul's last thoughts; and in the second epistle Timothy is told to "remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead" (2 Tim. 2.8). Paul was aware that, as he said, "the time has come for my departure" (2 Tim. 4.6). He knew he was soon to die. But Christ's resurrection gave him hope.<br><br>[Extracted from Where Did Jesus Go? by David Holloway (1983) pp 121-128]<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Saddlebacks, Basics and Paradigms">(January 2003) Saddlebacks, Basics and Paradigms</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2003</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The two "RW's"</b><br><br>The good news is that at the same time as 2002 saw a further erosion of public belief and public morality, there were new (and old) voices taking us back to Christian basics. <br><br>For me 2002 will be remembered for the two "RWs" - for the appointment of Rowan Williams as the Archbishop of Canterbury in succession to George Carey and the discovery of Rick Warren, author of The Purpose Driven Life. Enough has been said about the former, and sadly it has had to be negative. With regard to the latter, however, very little has been said in the United Kingdom. The exception has been at Jesmond Parish Church where we were the first English church to join in the "40 Days of Purpose" programme that came from Saddleback Church where Rick Warren is the senior pastor. Not featured on Radio or TV or in the Press, Warren, nevertheless, is having huge significance for the kingdom of God. His influence is through teaching other pastors.</p>

<blockquote><div>Only one population definitely pays attention to Saddleback: pastors. Thousands of pastors flock to the church's annual Purpose Driven Ministries conference - 3,800 in May this year. They made The Purpose-Driven Church a best-seller. Warren apparently has little interest in fame, but he cares about reaching pastors. That's his health strategy. Through pastors he intends to change the world.</div></blockquote>

<p>So writes Tim Stafford. At the May 2002 conference there were pastors from all 50 US states and from 30 countries, including 4 JPC staff. Nor is there anything way out about the teaching. The "Purpose Driven" approach is "easy to miss because it seems so ordinary".</p>

<blockquote><div>Purpose-Driven is built around five fundamental purposes - fellowship, spiritual maturity, service, evangelism and worship - which just about any church, large or small, Pentecostal or Episcopal, can get behind. Purpose-Driven has to do with balance: making sure none of the five purposes gets neglected, and that no one of them dominates the church. It's a broad, middle-of-the-road appeal, yet pastors get excited about it.</div></blockquote>

<p>In reality, however, worship comes first (with evangelism a close second). Rick Warren says: "it is all about God not us". He is committed to the Bible. And he is committed to preaching the bible. People ask me how I can cope with 6 repeats of Carols by Candlelight sermons. I now reply that last Easter Rick Warren preached at 11 of the 12 Easter services held at Saddleback, during which 35,000 attended - double the normal attendance.<br><br><br><b>Back to basics</b><br><br>What is helpful about Saddleback is that it exemplifies the basic principles of "Church Growth" but these are seen as merely tools for communicating the basics about Jesus Christ and the gospel. They are not a magic formula for success. They are rather appropriate strategies for getting the gospel out in modern urban societies. <br><br>In the 17th century Richard Baxter, the author of the Reformed Pastor, had such social status that he could summon his whole parish of Kidderminster to the vicarage for a spiritual examination. He did this by families coming in turn. That was no longer possible in the 18th century. So Wesley tried riding around Britain on horseback, tethering his horse to a post in the market square (or by the pump at the north end of the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle, 30 May 1742) and preaching in the open air. But people do not associate now as they once did in such places or elsewhere in the open air.<br><br>Nor can they be easily visited in their homes - certainly not in the day time. Blanket home visiting by the clergy was a method for getting the gospel out in the 19th century and part of the 20th century in the West when the church had grown and there were very many full-time clergy. Once, however, women had joined the work-force in large numbers, domestic routines changed radically, and in many homes no-one is now present during the day time; and television, plus fears of opening the door to strangers after dark, makes unscheduled evening visiting difficult.<br><br>The development of "mega churches" like Saddleback was one answer to Christian communication in the last years of the 20th century. In such churches communication is centred no longer just on the clergy or church staff but on everyone. As Christian lay people are nurtured and taught, so they are the primary means of communication, in their homes, schools, colleges and other places of work. In such churches staff are not redundant but needed more than ever to resource the work. At Saddleback there are 176 full-time paid staff members and 13 pastors. <br><br>Around the world where the church is growing and the gospel is getting out, the growth of these larger churches is simply a matter of fact. The one conspicuous part of the world that has failed to see the development of very large churches is Western Europe. And Western Europe is the most secularized continent of all with significant church decline. But Rick Warren realizes that social structures for evangelism and the growth of Christian communities that provide appropriate ministries for everyone are valueless unless the basics of the bible are preached.<br><br><br><b>Theological paradigms</b><br><br>It is easy enough to say "back to basics" but in the modern world it is hard to achieve. That is because there have been paradigm shifts. A paradigm is a frame of reference or large scale hypothesis about reality that gives new understanding. It seems to make better sense of phenomena and so it gives greater coherence. Paradigms are basic assumptions that we all have. In the last century (the 20th century) the three main "world view" paradigms were Marxism, Secular Humanism and Christianity. In the 21st century Islam has replaced Marxism. <br><br>Paradigms are most easily recognized in the physical sciences where there have been several shifts over the centuries. There was the shift away from the Ptolemaic earth-centred paradigm to the Copernican heliocentric view where the planets revolve around the sun. Then there were the shifts with Newton and gravity and Einstein and relativity. <br><br>But along with scientific paradigm shifts, over the last four centuries there has gone a major moral paradigm shift. This started with the European Enlightenment in England in the 17th century, gained strength on continental Europe in the 18th century, and exploded in the 19th and 20th centuries. Jim Packer summarizes this moral paradigm shift as …</p>

<blockquote><div>… an abandoning of all forms of external authority in favour of intellectual and moral individualism … The effect of this individualism was that one's own personal reason, rather than the church or the community or the cultural tradition, became one's definer of reality; it was for each thinking person to work out for him or herself a personal solution to the riddles of life.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is why now intellectually and morally it is every one for themselves. Many trust no external authority. The result is "a shared embrace of materialist values projected by the press and media." And with regard to God we have a seen a four centuries long process of "God shrinking". <br><br>The Reformation in the 16th century saw a recovery of the biblical faith in God as one who rules, judges and saves. He was rightly seen as the source, sustainer and end of all things. But in the 17th century God was dethroned in favour of man; and, in deism, he was said to be the great mechanic who made the world but now lets it tick on without any interference. God was, in effect, banned from his world. In the 18th century Kant said God could not communicate with us by means of words. So with no "word of God", views about him were now checked against human feelings. Not surprisingly before long atheists were saying that when people talk about God they are only talking about themselves, their hopes and their fears. Then Nietzsche pronounced God "dead", and Marx, Darwin and Freud decided life could be lived better without him.<br><br>So with this paradigm shift, many in the 21st century either think of God as personal but limited, as a God who cannot always do what he wants, who overlooks sins the majority think acceptable, who makes no claims and who is infinitely tolerant. Or else they think of God in a New Age way as an immanent cosmic principle - a force that energizes the universe. What he is not, in this view, is the universe's Maker and Lord.<br><br><br><b>"The God who is there"</b><br><br>To get back to theological basics we have to get back to the biblical paradigm of the God who is not the product of human guesswork, but a self-announcing God who has taken the initiative to tell us who he is and what he has done. To help us at JPC to do this, later on this Spring we will be having a short morning sermon series entitled THE GOD WHO IS THERE. Do try to be present for those sermons.

                <p><i>[To help with our thinking generally at this time of the Giving Review, I have produced another edited piece from the "Expository Thoughts" of J.C.Ryle. The Victorian first Bishop of Liverpool is always challenging on the subject of money. His own wealthy father was bankrupted when Ryle was in his twenties. The following is from Luke's Gospel chapter 12 - David Holloway.]</i></p>

<blockquote><div>13 Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 14 Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?”15 Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” 16 And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. 17 He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’ 18 Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19 And I'll say to myself, 'You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.’ 20 But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ 21 This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God” (NIV).</div></blockquote>

<p>The parable we have just read gives us a remarkable instance of people's readiness to bring the things of this world into the middle of their religion. We are told that a certain hearer of our Lord asked him to help him in his temporal affairs. "Teacher," he said, "tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me." <br><br>He probably had some vague idea that Jesus was going to set up a kingdom of this world and to begin to reign on earth. So he resolves to make an early application about his own financial matters. He asks our Lord to interfere in the business of an earthly inheritance. Other hearers of Christ might be thinking of a place in the world to come. This man was one whose chief thought, evidently, was on this present life.<br><br>How many hearers of the Gospel are just like this man! How many are incessantly planning and scheming about the things of time, even under the very sound of the things of eternity! The natural heart of man is always the same. Even the preaching of Christ did not arrest the attention of all his hearers. The minister of Christ in the present day must never be surprised to see worldliness and inattention in the middle of his congregation. The servant must not expect his sermons to be more valued than his Master's!<br><br><br><b>A solemn warning</b><br><br>Let us note, first, in these verses, what a solemn warning our Lord pronounces against greed.</p>

<blockquote><div>He said to them [the crowd], 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed.</div></blockquote>

<p>It would be impossible to decide positively which is the most common sin in the world. It would be safe to say that there is none, at any rate, to which the heart is more prone than greed. It was this sin which helped to cast down the angels who fell. They were not content with their first condition. They were greedy and wanted something better. <br><br>It was this sin which helped drive Adam and Eve out of paradise and bring death into the world. Our first parents were not satisfied with the things which God gave them in Eden. They were greedy for more; so they fell. It is a sin which, ever since the fall, has been the fertile cause of misery and unhappiness on earth. Wars, quarrels, strifes, divisions, envyings, disputes, jealousies, hatreds of all sorts, both public and private, may nearly all be traced back to this fountain-head. Let the warning which our Lord pronounces sink down into our hearts and bear fruit in our lives. Let us earnestly try to learn the lesson which St. Paul had mastered when he says,</p>

<blockquote><div>I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances" (Phil 4.11). </div></blockquote>

<p>Let us pray for a thorough confidence in God's superintending providence over all our worldly affairs and God's perfect wisdom in all his arrangements concerning us. If we have little, let us be sure of his plan for our good. If the things that we have are taken away, let us be satisfied that there is a purpose. Happy is the one who is persuaded that whatever is, is best, and has ceased from fruitless wishing and become "content with what they have" (Heb 13.5).<br><br><br><b>The folly of worldly mindedness</b><br><br>Let us note, secondly, in these verses, what a withering exposure our Lord makes of the folly of worldly mindedness. He draws the picture of a rich man of the world whose mind is wholly set on earthly things. He paints him scheming and planning about his property, as if he was master of his own life and had simply to say, "I will do this," and it would be done. <br><br>Then he turns the picture and shows us God requiring the soul of this man of the world and asking the heart-searching question, "Who will get what you have provided for yourself?" <br><br>"Folly", Jesus makes us learn - nothing less than "folly" - is the right word by which to describe the conduct of the man who thinks of nothing but his money. The man who "stores up things for himself but is not rich towards God," is the man whom God declares to be a "fool".<br><br>It is an awful thought that the character which Jesus brings before us in this parable is far from being uncommon. <br><br>Thousands in every age of the world have lived continually doing the very things which are here condemned. Thousands are doing them at this very day. They are storing up possessions on earth and thinking of nothing but how to increase them. They are continually adding to their wealth as if they were to enjoy it for ever, and as if there was no death, no judgement and no world to come. <br><br>And yet these are the people who are called clever and prudent and wise! These are the people who are commended and flattered and held up to admiration! Truly the Lord sees not as we see! The Lord declares that rich who live only for this world are "fools".<br><br>Let us pray for the rich. Their souls are in great danger. "Heaven," said a great man on his death-bed, "is a place to which few kings and rich men come." Even when converted, the rich carry a great weight and run the race to heaven under great disadvantages. The possession of money has a most hardening effect upon the conscience.</p>

<blockquote><div>The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs" (1 Tim 6.10). </div></blockquote>

<p>Poverty has many advantages. Riches destroy far more souls than poverty.<br><br><br><b>Being rich towards God</b><br><br>Let us note, lastly, in these verses, how important it is to be rich towards God. This is true wisdom. This is true providing for the time to come. This is genuine prudence. The wise man is the one who does not think only of earthly treasures but of treasures in heaven.<br><br>When can it be said of a man that he is rich towards God? Never until he is rich in grace, rich in faith and rich in good works! Never until he has applied to Jesus Christ and bought "from him gold refined in the fire" (Rev 3:18)! Never until he has "an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands" (2 Cor 5.1)! Never until he has a name written in the book of life and is "an heir of God and co-heir with Christ" (Rom 8.17)! Such a man is truly rich. His treasure is incorruptible. His bank never collapses. His inheritance never fades away. No one can deprive him of it. Death cannot snatch it out of his hands. All things are his already - the world, life, death, the present or the future (1 Cor 3.22). And best of all, what he has now is nothing to what he will have afterwards.<br><br>Riches like these are within the reach of every sinner who will come to Christ and receive them. May we never rest until they are ours! To obtain them may cost us something in the world. It may bring on us persecution, ridicule and scorn. But let the thought comfort us that the Judge of all says, "You are rich" (Rev 2.9). The true Christian is the only person who is really wealthy and wise.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Empty Tomb">(April 2003) The Empty Tomb</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2003</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>The Resurrection - the New Testament doctrine of the Resurrection, not a post-modern reconstruction of it - lies at the heart of the Christian faith. 'If you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved' (Romans 10:9). But was this not just a 'spiritual' resurrection of Jesus rather than a 'physical' resurrection?<br><br>Of course, the Resurrection of Jesus was not a crude resuscitation of a corpse; it was a glorious transformation. In that sense his old 'flesh and blood' (to use Paul's phrase) did not inherit the new order of 'the Kingdom of God' (1 Corinthians 15:50). But what Paul implies and the New Testament elsewhere makes quite clear is that on the first Easter morning Jesus' tomb was found empty; and it was found empty because Jesus had risen. To suggest that it does not matter if the bones of Jesus are still in the soil of Palestine is clearly contrary to the plain meaning of the texts and is, therefore, dangerous heresy and needs to be opposed. <br><br>People who still want to use the language of 'resurrection' while denying the Empty Tomb have to say that the Empty Tomb is a myth. That is to say, they present it as a story concocted to illustrate the meaning of 'resurrection'. But that is not what the Bible teaches. According to the text of the Bible, the Empty Tomb is clearly not just an illustration of the meaning of the Resurrection; it is the evidence for the Resurrection.<br><br>If you believe the Empty Tomb is merely a visual aid, it will be of no essential significance. Belief in it, even though well grounded, will be held to be secondary or optional. That is the view of the former Bishop of Durham. He argued that the Empty Tomb is a symbol of 'the assertion, made by God and received by faith, that in this world, through this world and beyond this world we may be sure that in the end, love succeeds, love brings it off, love has the last word. Jesus, the flesh and blood expression of down-to-earth love is at the very "right hand of God".' <br><br>But that is to destroy meanings. The words sound so good (if you can understand them), yet they reduce the Resurrection to a platitude about love. Yes, 'love' is vital. God, indeed, is love. But the Resurrection of Jesus is saying more than just that - true though it is.<br><br>It was the philosopher Wittgenstein who said that you could trace the breakdown in religious belief to a 'credit rating decline' in the concepts that we use. Such reductionism has been and is destroying the credit rating of the Resurrection.<br><br>This 'new theology' is not the position of the Christian Church down the centuries. It is not the faith that countless men and women have lived and died for. They knew that had the tomb not been empty everything that they affirmed would have been falsified. If Jesus' remains had still been in the tomb, only the extremes of Gnosticism could have believed that death had lost its sting and the grave had lost its victory.<br><br><br><b>The New Testament</b><br><br>How, though, can we be sure that the tomb was empty? Is the evidence of the texts not rather weak? The main textual evidence for the Empty Tomb is there in the Gospel narratives - the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. But the argument is sometimes put forward that the Resurrection accounts are all so different and therefore cannot be reliable. What do we say to this?<br><br>It is true that the Resurrection narratives are different in the four Gospels. But the basic difference lies in the accounts of the appearances of Jesus to the disciples, not in the accounts of how women (and others) found the tomb of Jesus empty. It is not at all strange, in any case, that the Gospel writers have different accounts of the appearances of Jesus to his disciples. Different apostles most probably reported different appearances on different occasions. On the other hand, it is quite remarkable how similar the accounts of the Empty Tomb are in all four Gospels. There is an amazing unanimity. <br><br>The three Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) all agree on three things:</p>

<blockquote><div>1) that some women, including Mary Magdalene, went to the tomb of Jesus on the first day of the week and found the stone rolled away from the tomb's entrance;2) that a young man (or some angelic presence) explained what had happened, saying, 'He is risen, he is not here';3) that the women were frightened and left the tomb. </div></blockquote>

<p>When we look at John 20:1-2 we find that the fourth Gospel also fits in with this outline. The only difference there is that the angelic interpreter has not been mentioned - but two angels are mentioned in verses 11-13, when Mary is back at the tomb.<br><br>It is quite clear that the Gospel writers were drawing on different sources and different accounts of the Resurrection, but these sources all agree over the Empty Tomb. Mark's Gospel is generally reckoned to be written in the 60s of the first century AD. But the information he (and the others) drew on was preached, remembered and probably recorded much earlier. As late as AD 56 when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians, we are told that many of the disciples who had seen Jesus after the Resurrection 'are still alive' (1 Corinthians 15:6). It is unthinkable that any eyewitnesses would have allowed an Empty Tomb tradition to develop so uniformly if it was fiction.<br><br>Paul, however, as someone is bound to point out, does not mention the Empty Tomb. True, but he implies it. In 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 he speaks about the basic core of the Gospel: 'that Christ died ... that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day ... and that he appeared [to various disciples].'<br><br>This early 'creed' thus focused on the burial as well as the death of Christ. As Professor F.F.Bruce says, 'Burial emphasizes the reality of the resurrection which followed, as a divine act which reversed the act of men.' It points to the Empty Tomb. We have to say that what was raised was what was buried - i.e. the body of Jesus. <br><br>Note, also, that Paul specifies that the Resurrection happened on the 'third day'. What could give rise to this specific date except the discovery of the Empty Tomb? Had there been no Empty Tomb but only visionary experiences, there would be no possible reason for such an emphasis on the 'third day'. <br><br>More importantly, this 'basic core' or 'creed' of belief made it clear that Christians believed and must still believe both 'that he was raised on the third day' and 'that he appeared'. The appearances by themselves are not the gospel or good news. Some of the early disciples thought they were just having a psychic experience (Luke 24:37). But together with the Empty Tomb - a resurrection that reversed the burial - the appearances pointed to the true nature of Jesus' Resurrection: it was a 'bodily' resurrection. Certainly Paul presupposes 'bodily change' in 1 Corinthians 15:51: 'We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed.' He may not explicitly have mentioned the Empty Tomb - instead he took it for granted, as any Jew would have done in talk of 'resurrection'. Unlike the Greeks, the Jews did not see a person as a soul entrapped in a body awaiting release at death. Rather, they saw a person more as 'body and soul' together. The great hope then was for a resurrection that included the body.<br><br>There are two further questions we must ask over the Empty Tomb. First, a very simple question: Why did the Jewish authorities never produce the remains of Christ to silence the Christian movement once and for all, if in fact Christ's body was still in the tomb or had been removed? The only explanation which has maintained its credibility over the centuries is that there was no body for them to produce, because of Jesus' bodily Resurrection. <br><br>Secondly, if the Resurrection does not encompass the transformation of the physical body, what do we say in the final analysis about this material universe? What ultimately happens to this universe of space and time? Is it all just some great mistake that God tries to forget? That was the Gnostic heresy - to say 'matter is bad or mistaken'. <br><br>John Polkinghorne, formerly Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge, then ordained and then President of Queens' College, Cambridge, says, 'No! It is not a mistake.' And the key is the Empty Tomb. 'The Empty Tomb,' he writes, 'says to me that matter has a destiny, a transformed and transmuted destiny, no doubt, but a destiny nevertheless. The material creation is not a transient, even mistaken episode'. That was Paul's view also. He saw Christ's Resurrection as the 'first fruits'. Ultimately, he said, the creative power of God will transform the whole material universe: 'The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God' (Romans 8:21).<br><br>[The above is an extract from my book Church and State in the New Millennium (London, HarperCollins, 2000, pp 201-205) - DRJH]<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Ascension (I)">(May 2003) The Ascension (I)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2003</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>When you study the Bible it is not just the central and more obvious statements that are important. So often it is the asides. These show us what the writers really thought and believed when, if you like, they were off their guard. Take the section from Peter's first epistle where he speaks of Christ going and preaching to "the spirits in prison". He then mentions Noah's ark and the Flood, which leads him on to say:</p>

<blockquote><div>this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also - not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand - with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him" (1 Pet 3.21).</div></blockquote>

<p>Much of this is almost as obscure as the question of the "descent" to the "spirits in prison". For example, how are we to think of baptism? Christians have been divided over this question and it still continues to exercise them. But those controversial issues mustn't make us ignore the little verse tucked in at the end. We can easily overlook it.<br><br>Here is Peter talking about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and says that this means he "has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand - with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him". This is just an aside, but it is of supreme significance. For if you had asked someone in the Apostolic age, "Where did Jesus go?", this is probably the answer you would have been given: "He has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God."<br><br>This is significant because it shows us how Peter viewed Jesus at the time he was writing. This was the Jesus of his present experience. It shows us what the New Testament Christians believed about Jesus even when they faced terrible problems including persecution. And what it shows is this: from all the different things that could be said about the risen Jesus, one thing stood out above the rest and of this they were sure - Jesus was exalted; he was and is over all; or as Paul put it, "he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy" (Col 1.18).<br><br>Peter's words, however, are not a studied theological statement. It is an almost unconscious remark. He can't help saying this. For this is the Jesus he knows now. He is not just the risen Christ but the ascended Christ. As an eyewitness to the Ascension, as Luke reports, he had seen something that convinced him, if he didn't know already, that Jesus was "at God's right hand - with angels, authorities, and powers in submission to him." <br><br>Peter had further experienced this on the day of Pentecost. That was when the ascended Christ released the Holy Spirit in a remarkable way for the Church. As Jesus had earlier promised, the disciples would be "clothed with power from on high" (Luke 24.49). Because this had happened Peter and the other Apostles were able to defy the hostile Jewish authorities and proclaim "in Jesus the resurrection of the dead" (Acts 4.2).<br><br>We may find this hard to understand. Peter didn't. He knew something first hand of the victory of Christ and the fact that he was King. He believed that something was now true in the universe of space and time and beyond. That is why he could give a message of hope to his readers. Maybe they were, or some were, in terrible suffering. Some were, when he was writing, being persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ. But this would only be for a short time, because, as a straightforward matter of fact, Christ was the victor and reigning and in control. <br><br>He'd personally experienced that in a dramatic way on one occasion, according to Acts, when he was freed from prison (Acts 12.3-11). True, at the very same time Herod had "James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword" (Acts 12.2). There is a mystery in suffering. It is seldom easy to understand. But what Peter would say is this: the last word is not with suffering but with Christ.<br><br>This is the message of the book of Revelation, where Jesus is portrayed not only as the "Lamb" who was sacrificed, but also the "Lamb at the throne". So the cry "of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand" is this: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise" (Rev 5.11-12).<br><br><br><b>"Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven"</b><br><br>It is amazing how hazy people can be over the ascension of Jesus Christ. Once I was talking to a younger person, who was very well educated. "Yes," he said, "I believe in the Ascension; but I don't believe in the resurrection of Jesus!"<br><br>Taken at its face value the New Testament seems to be relatively clear. The main evidence is in Luke and Acts.<br><br>Easter in Jerusalem had gone - that was the period of the Passover and the few days of unleavened bread. Many of the disciples who were predominantly from Galilee in the North must have returned home. The distance was short. Some weeks later it was time to visit Jerusalem again for the Festival of Pentecost, or the "feast of weeks". So back they went; and in Jerusalem they had a final encounter with the risen Jesus. He gave them a charge: this time they were to stay in Jerusalem and to wait for the coming of the promised Holy Spirit. <br><br>And then in Acts 1.9 we read this: "After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight."<br><br>Many people today find that impossible to believe. Yes, they can theoretically cope, just about, with the idea of "miracle"; and then when they have looked at the evidence, they have to admit that something happened that first Easter. But the Ascension - that is too much to be asked to believe.<br><br>John Robinson was a Bishop of Woolwich in the nineteen sixties and wrote the book Honest to God. In it he popularized the radical theology that, arguably, has lead to the loss of nerve and vitality in the Church in England. But what for us is interesting is that he begins the book with some remarks on the Ascension:</p>

<blockquote><div>Even such an educated man of the world as St Luke can express the conviction of Christ's ascension - the conviction that he is not merely alive but reigns in the might and right of God - in the crudest terms of being 'lifted up' into heaven, there to sit down at the right hand of the Most High.</div></blockquote>

<p>In a similar vein C.J.Cadoux had written earlier about the body of Jesus rising "vertically off the surface of the earth" and disappearing into the sky:</p>

<blockquote><div>Such an occurrence is so hard to believe, that nothing save the most unimpeachable evidence could justify one in believing it ... It is much simpler and more satisfying to abandon altogether the idea of an ascension of Jesus' body and to regard the belief in such an ascension and Luke's description of it as resulting naturally from the need of explaining why the series of visions came to an end." </div></blockquote>

<p>But, "Why," asks G.R.Beasley-Murray, another New Testament scholar, "discredit Luke's reliability at this point?"<br><br><br><b>Cosmology</b><br><br>We have the problem of the "three decker universe" or so we are told. Modern science has changed our understanding of the physical universe. Previously it was all right to talk of "heaven above". In those days people could cope with the Ascension. But we can't today.<br><br>Is that true? The New Testament writers needed "spatial" metaphors as much as we need them today. It is by no means certain that they were talking "primitive cosmology" when they talked about the ascension of Jesus or were implying a belief in a primitive world view.<br><br>There has been a Christian instinct never to put absolute confidence in any cosmological system or scientific theory about the nature of the physical universe. "Natural scientists and philosophers have attempted to explain 'nature'; but not one of their theories or systems has remained firm and unshaken; but each is overthrown by its successor." And this was not said at the time of the nineteenth century controversies over Science and Religion, nor even at the time of Galileo. It came from the pen of Basil of Cappodocia in the fourth century AD in his Hexaëmeron.<br><br>What is so noticeable about the New Testament is the absence of reference to the structure of the universe of space. In the Jewish intertestamental literature as indeed in Gnostic literature this often seems to be a preoccupation. In the non-biblical 2 Enoch, for example, we are given a veritable "hitch-hiker's guide to the galaxy", as Enoch goes not only through the "seven heavens" but on to the "tenth" to meet God and get his secrets; and these included the secrets of how the universe was made and formed. <br><br>But in the (biblical) Book of Revelation there is hardly any "cosmological geography". At the end of the seven letters to the churches we read this: "After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, 'Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.' At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it" (Rev 4.1-2). Heaven is "up"; but there is no "journey" there. "At once" he is there "in the Spirit". There is no flying through the various "heavens". The language of the "three decker" universe was certainly used in Revelation as elsewhere but it is figurative.<br><br>Paul spoke of being "caught up to the third heaven", the location of "Paradise", when he was describing a visionary experience (2 Cor 12.2-3). But this is not a journey to another place in a distant part of the universe; rather, in Paul, it reads like a translation to a different order of existence. By the time he is writing the "third heaven" is probably a synonym for "Paradise". That is where it was traditionally located. It was therefore a figure of speech. Indeed speculation on these cosmological questions was discouraged by Paul. People were not "to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies" - Jewish and Gnostic speculations based on the Old Testament creation story (1 Tim 1.4).<br><br>We mustn't assume that the New Testament writers were naïve in these matters - "as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing" (Tolstoy describing Vera Berg in War and Peace when she spoke of "our days" in a superior way). People have had queries and questions about the Ascension long before the rise of modern science. <br><br>Before the Reformation you can find scribal comments on early manuscripts about the problem of the Ascension. One scribe once suggested that if anyone was stupid enough to think of Christ as travelling through space, assuming a pre-Copernican view, it would take an enormous length of time for Christ even to reach the first heaven, let alone the seventh! There have been sensitive Christians aware of the issues throughout the centuries.<br><br><br><b>The meaning of the Ascension</b><br><br>What was the relationship between the Resurrection and the Ascension? We need to remind ourselves that the resurrection of Jesus was not a resuscitation to normal earthly life. It was the beginning of the new age, the first-fruits of that new kingdom. "The resurrection of Jesus was the emergence of eternal life in the midst of mortality." In this context some see the resurrection and "exaltation" of Jesus - his being raised to the right hand of God - as one.<br><br>Peter links the two in his Pentecost sermon: "God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. Exalted to the right hand of God" (Acts 2.32-33). Also in the early hymn that seems to lie behind Philippians 2 you have the death of Jesus followed by his exaltation, with no resurrection in between:</p>

<blockquote><div>being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death - even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" (Phil 2.8-11). </div></blockquote>

<p>It is possible, therefore, that the early Christians saw the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus all as one. But if that is so, if they are intimately linked, is that a reason for dismissing Luke's account as really an intrusion?<br><br>Michael Ramsey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, says "No!": "The tradition in Luke concerning the Ascension as a distinct event cannot be dismissed. There is nothing incredible in an event whereby Jesus assured the disciples that the appearances were ended and that his sovereignty and his presence must henceforth be sought in new ways."<br><br>There is obviously something profound about the Ascension; it is a profound mystery. But whatever we might feel unable to say about it, it was certainly, as Luke shows us, a final event. It was the last of the appearances of Christ to his disciples. It was the signal that the end of Jesus' resurrection appearances had come. Only once after this did he appear again, and that was said to be highly irregular: "last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born" wrote Paul (1 Cor 15.8). Paul knew that this seeing the risen Christ was outside the main series of appearances.<br><br>But how did Paul know? How did he know that there was such a series? Because it was in the tradition he had received, which is much earlier than Luke's writing. But how did those early Christians, who passed on the tradition to Paul and were the source of it, know that the resurrection appearances formed a series? Because there must have been a recognizable end. They knew it was a series because the sequence had finished. It was no longer "open". But there must have been some special event that brought home to them that conviction. Luke says there was, and that event was the Ascension that occurred at Bethany on the slopes of the Mount of Olives (Luke 24.50; Acts 1.12). As John also refers to the Ascension (John 20.17), quite independently of Luke, it seems perverse not to take it seriously.<br><br>If we do, we will therefore want to say that at least it served to convince the disciples that the appearances had ended. If we are going to emphasize the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus as one unity, these appearances to the disciples of Jesus in bodily form perhaps "were condescensions of the glorified Christ". But whatever they were, they had ended. Jesus Christ had returned to and remained at his Father's "right hand".<br><br><br><b>Details</b><br><br>In the Acts' account of the Ascension it is portrayed as a decisive and deliberate withdrawal from sight; and there was something gradual about the withdrawal. Perhaps here is the problem. It was not an immediate disappearance. It was not like the disappearance of Christ on the Emmaus Road. On that occasion we are told, "their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he disappeared from their sight" (Luke 24.31).<br><br>Modern people, if they believe at all, probably find this sort of "vanishing" more conceivable. They know the world of space and time; perhaps they can believe in the world of eternity and of the spirit at the same time. But the two are quite separate. So they find it easier to think of a sudden transition from time to eternity, with no connection and no merging of the two. It is easier to think of that than of time and eternity merging. Here is how C.S.Lewis explains it:</p>

<blockquote><div>Perhaps mere instantaneous vanishing would make us more comfortable, A sudden break between the perceptible and the imperceptible would worry us less than any kind of joint. But if the spectators say they saw first a short vertical movement and then a vague luminosity (that is what 'cloud' presumably means here as it certainly does in the account of the Transfiguration) and then nothing - have we any reason to object?</div></blockquote>

<p>The "cloud" was in the Bible a symbol often for the divine presence. In the days of Moses a "cloud" was above the tent of meeting. It was a visible sign to Israel that the glory of the Lord was there (Exodus 40.34). A "cloud" featured in the transfiguration of Jesus: "a cloud appeared and enveloped them" (Mark 9.7). And Jesus described his own return, his parousia, as a "coming in [or on the] clouds" (Mark 13.26; 14.62). That is why it is helpful to think of the transfiguration, ascension and parousia of Jesus as three successive manifestations to men and women of his divine glory.<br><br>Of course, there is a danger of pressing too far the details of an event like the Ascension. But according to Luke and Acts what happened was this: the disciples had an amazing and overwhelming experience of Christ as he decisively passed into a world beyond human conception and understanding; and those who spoke about it tried to tell the story in simple and intelligible words. They were forced to use what E.M.Blaiklock calls the "symbols of wealth, royalty and elevation."<br><br>We need not be too concerned with the alleged "three decker" theory of the universe that is said to make the account irrelevant if not fictitious. "Anyone appearing to leave the earth's surface," writes F.F.Bruce, "must appear to spectators to be ascending, and so, when the cloud enveloped the visible form of their Lord, his disciples stood 'looking steadfastly into heaven as he went.' Some of them, perhaps, remembering a previous experience, expected that the cloud would dissolve and Jesus be left with them, as on the Mount of Transfiguration."<br><br>We cannot press the details too far. But we can understand that the Ascension is speaking of a link between time and eternity. It all ties in with the empty tomb. If the tomb was empty on that first resurrection morning, as we have argued it was (see Coloured Supplement April 2003), Jesus had a resurrection body, a glorified body - a body "raised in glory" (1 Cor 15.43). It was not a crude resuscitation of a corpse. It was not the putting together of the pre-crucifixion body of Jesus. It was a transformed body. It was the body of the new age, the resurrection age. Yet it was not unrelated to the old body. It all adds up to this. Eternity is not unrelated to this world of space and time. We can't just separate time and eternity, or matter and spirit.<br><br>The incarnation spells this out. Then "the Word became flesh" (John 1.14). The Ascension tells the same story. Time and eternity are connected. This is also what Peter is concerned to say in his first epistle. He believed that the affairs of space and time can be and are affected by real ties with "heaven". The sufferings he and his friends were going through were not happening in a vacuum. They were not a piece of blind fate alone. They were certainly not out of control. For Jesus is exalted and over all.<br><br>[An extract from Where did Jesus go? by David Holloway (Marshalls, London, 1983) pp 136-145.]<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Ascension (II)">(June 2003) The Ascension (II)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2003</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>In our study of the Ascension (begun Coloured Supplement May 2003), we need to re-focus for a moment and consider another doctrine that raises similar questions - the descent of Jesus to the dead.<br><br>The New Testament puts death on the centre of the stage. It spends a great deal of its space talking about the death of Jesus. It says death is real. Dying is real; and sometimes dying can be terrifying, as it was for Jesus on the cross. Yet the good news of the Christian gospel is this: yes, death is terrible; but Jesus Christ became man </p>

<blockquote><div>that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death - that is, the devil - and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death" (Heb 2.14-15).</div></blockquote>

<p>One of the great consequences of the death and resurrection of Jesus is the hope and assurance they bring. That Jesus descended to the dead is one element in this assurance. So what does it mean when we say in the Apostles Creed: "He descended to the dead"?<br><br><br><b>Hades and Hell</b><br><br>Peter said on the day of Pentecost: "Seeing what was ahead, [David] spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave [literally, 'Hades'], nor did his body see decay" (Acts 2.31). If Christ was not abandoned to Hades, he went there first! But what is "Hades" and how does it differ from "Hell"?<br><br>The traditional versions of the Apostles Creed, that some still use, have "he descended into Hell" rather than "to the dead" or "to Hades". "Hell" is misleading, as English meanings have changed since these early translations. Originally "Hell" was used to translate two distinct words in the Greek text of the New Testament. It no longer is so used. The result has been some confusion.<br><br>The two distinct words are Gehenna and Hades. Each of these words has its roots in the Old Testament. Gehenna is the valley of Hinnom, the refuse dump outside Jerusalem where the garbage was burned. It had been the place of idolatrous child sacrifice. Its meaning was then extended to include the place of final retribution for sinners - "Hell" as we understand it today.<br><br>Hades was very different. It is Sheol of the Old Testament, the place of the departed. It refers to the whole of the unseen world that, it was believed, we pass into at death.<br><br>Gehenna is a place of punishment. Jesus said: "if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into Hell [Gehenna]" (Matt 5.30) Hades is more neutral. It is a place of waiting. Both the good and the bad are there according to the Old Testament.<br><br>The problem is that in normal modern usage "hell" is always used to refer to the state of final punishment only; so it translates now Gehenna only. In the Creed, as in Peter's Pentecost sermon, it is said that Jesus went not to Gehenna but to Hades. That is why modern versions of the Apostles' Creed have not that Jesus "descended into Hell", instead they have, "he descended to the dead". And that is right.<br><br>So what is meant is simply this: Jesus went through death into the unseen beyond the grave.<br><br>But how can we say today that Jesus descended to the dead? Isn't this pure mythology? Isn't such a doctrine a "fantastic dream" - as one liberal scholar says:</p>

<blockquote><div>nothing else than the appropriation, and the application to Christ, of a fragment of the redemption-mythology of the Oriental religions, best known to us in the ancient story of the Descent of Ishtar to the underworld, and reflected also in a number of Greek myths (Orpheus and Eurydice, Heracles and Alcestis, the story of Persephone, etc.)?" And he adds that these are all "rooted in vegetation- and sun-myths".</div></blockquote>

<p>Well, what do we say? Is it mythology?<br><br><br><b>Mythology</b><br><br>A great deal of confusion has often come from the use of the word "mythology". It means different things to different people.<br><br>How can we define "mythology"? Rudolph Bultmann, who used the word very freely and in so doing greatly influenced the theological world (negatively) in the last half of the 20th century, once defined it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life, the other side in terms of this side.</div></blockquote>

<p>Few would find fault with that use of the word "mythology". Maybe the word is dangerous as suggesting "fairy stories" or "myths" just like the Greek myths just referred to; but if the word is used in this technical and sophisticated way, we can see a lot of what Christians say is "mythological". To say God is "Our Father" is mythological in this sense. For we don't mean that God is exactly like a human father. We can't ask, for example, who is his wife? We simply mean, and the Bible means, that God exhibits "fatherly" characteristics (in fact he supremely does so). But he is not a "literal" father in the way a human being is a father. We are "expressing the other worldly in terms of this world." And that is necessary when talking about God. Why then has there been such a great controversy over the question of "myth" in Christianity?<br><br>The problem came from Bultmann himself. Yet the problem is not because of Bultmann's view of the way religious language works. The problem came over what he said religious language refers to. For he said that our religious language or our biblical "mythology" is mostly referring to man and not God and the world. A great many of the religious statements about Christ, the eternal world, about his incarnation, about the reality of demonic forces, about the Resurrection, Ascension and Last Judgment are not statements about the way things happened or are in the external world or will be one day, according to this view. They are really statements about man's inner consciousness! Why? Because, said Bultmann, modern man cannot believe in these things; you can't at one and the same time use electricity and believe in the "supernatural". Why on earth not?<br><br>But we do need to be careful about the use of the word "mythology" in connection with statements of belief.<br><br>It is often felt that a "myth", even in this technical sense, is something mysterious or uncertain; to use a myth means we cannot really know or be definite about what we are saying. So it is said, in Christian theology, because we use "mythological" language to describe the "beginning" and the "end", we don't really know what happened at the beginning, nor can we know what will happen at the end. Indeed, because we have to use "mythological" language about the end, as is obviously being done in the book of Revelation, some wonder whether anything at all will happen at the end!<br><br>We have to be careful. We do have to use "picture language" (that is less misleading than the term "mythological language") to talk about the Second Coming, life after death, Heaven and Hell. But Christians have always been aware of that. So Augustine, wring on the fact that Christians believe that "Christ is seated at God's right hand," said of "sitting" (in the 4th century AD): "the expression indicates not a posture of the members, but judicial power, which the majesty never fails to possess." Although he did not call this "mythological" - the word or its equivalent wouldn't have occurred to him - he knew that this was the way language worked.<br><br><br><b>Pre-Copernican myths?</b><br><br>Augustine would never, however, have been doubtful about what Christ was doing now. He would never have dreamt of saying he didn't know. For he knew that Christ was "sitting at the right hand of God." True, the only way he could talk was to use the "picture language" that he got from the Bible. But this language was positive and definite.<br><br>The fact that we talk about the future and life after death in "mythological" terms is irrelevant as far as reality is concerned. The reality of the situations or events we are talking about is not affected by the kind of language we use. It is vital to remember this. We have, therefore, no need to be hesitant about what we are saying. Of course, we need to be humble and realise that although we see and are not in the dark, we may only be seeing partially. But partial seeing is seeing something.<br><br>To be hesitant about what we say when we have to use "picture language" or "mythological language" is something like this: I ask you, "What happens at dawn?" And you answer, "I don't know; all I can do is to use a pre-Copernican myth and say 'the sun rises'."<br><br>Now if you say that, I don't think you are clever, but simply incapable of using language. What happens in the morning is that the sun does rise, as we all know. There is an objective event that happens. We may think that the pre-Copernican myth can be misunderstood. Today we say that the earth goes round the sun and not vice-versa. But as we all know the "myth" is usually capable of communicating. We can work with it perfectly well. In fact, granted our limitations, namely that we are on earth and not out in space, this is a clear way of talking, clearer than if we had given an answer in post-Copernican terms.<br><br>We can now begin to see why to scorn the descent of Jesus to the dead as mythological is unreasonable. We have already seen how much criticism of the Ascension is unreasonable (Coloured Supplement May 2003). "All this belongs to a three-decker universe," some say. "Christians and their creeds are tied to this universe. We've rejected such a view of the universe; let's reject these creeds."<br><br>But it is not so simple. The earliest Christians were far less "spatially" hide bound than we imagine. In any case, they had to, as we have to, use spatial metaphors. This was almost whether they liked it or not. Space goes with value. We normally use metaphors of space to indicate value or superior or inferior position even when there is no question of "geographical location" We say, "Prices are up and wages are down." In an Examination or Election one person comes out "on top"; others, in terms of results, are "underneath" or "below" or even "bottom" (indeed, "superior" and "inferior" are the Latin for "higher" and "lower"). So when we say Jesus Christ descended to the dead or Hades, we don't mean that he went under the earth. "The language of descent," says J.I.Packer, "is used because Hades, being the place of the disembodied, is lower in worth and dignity than life on earth, where the body and soul are together and humanity is in that sense whole."<br><br><br><b>"At the right hand of God"</b><br><br>We must now return to the Ascension. The Ascension, the New Testament affirms, was an event in the past (cf Coloured Supplement May 2003). Its ultimate importance, however, is not in itself and the details of it, nor even in the fact that it made the disciples aware that the resurrection appearances had ended. Its importance lies in what it then came to symbolise - the fact that Christ is now "at the right hand of God".<br><br>This is the best language can do. We have already noted the limitations of language and Augustine's comment on this phrase. Calvin puts it like this: "It is not a question of the disposition of his body, but of the majesty of his authority." Karl Barth says:</p>

<blockquote><div>It states pictorially the truth which from its very nature cannot be represented, that the might and sovereignty of God is in actual fact identical with the might and sovereignty of him who as true God became true man and as such died upon the cross and of course rose again." </div></blockquote>

<p>This is a picture of an Eastern court. It means that Christ is invested with the full majesty and authority of God. This imagery did communicate, and it still does (we talk of "the right hand man"). The early Christians communicated with it their supreme belief that Jesus is reigning. This was their basic belief about Christ.<br><br>They used to look back to the Old Testament to see verses or parts of the Old Testament that most applied to Jesus Christ and their experience of him in the present. There was one verse they went back to time and time again. What was it? It was the first verse of Psalm 110:</p>

<blockquote><div>The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.</div></blockquote>

<p>Jesus himself had been the first one to use this text. According to Mark chapter 12 verse 36 he had done so in his teaching in the temple. Then at Pentecost Peter applied this verse to Jesus as the one "exalted to the right hand of God" (Acts 2.33). It is cited in a number of places in the New Testament. One New Testament scholar says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Wherever we read of Christ being at the right hand of God, or of hostile powers being subjected to Him, the ultimate reference is to this passage. In view of the place which Psalm 110.1 holds in the New Testament, we may safely put it down as one of the fundamental texts of the primitive kerygma [or preaching].</div></blockquote>

<p>The use then of this imagery did not come about because of a particular view of the cosmos - a three decker view; rather it came about because the imagery was in the Old Testament. But more fundamental still. It came about because the early Christians believed it was profoundly true, Jesus is King.<br><br>Some think that it got into credal statements right from the start. Paul's letter to the Romans perhaps indicates this. At one point in that great epistle his argument presupposes that his readers know already that it is "Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life - [who] is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us" (Rom 8.34). Some think this reflects an early credal formula.<br><br>The idea was certainly central to the thinking of the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews. We are there told that Jesus was a "high priest in the order of Melchizedek" (Heb 5.10). Later he is said to be such a priest "for ever" (Heb 6.20). What was so significant about Melchizedek? He was both "king of Salem [Jerusalem]" and "priest of God Most High" (Heb 7.1). "His name means 'king of righteousness'; then also, 'king of Salem' means 'king of peace'" (Heb 7.2). Hebrews therefore stresses the kingship of Christ in his priestly role.<br><br>But perhaps the greatest statement of this theme is in the epistle to the Ephesians. Paul is wanting the Christians he is writing to to experience something of the power of God in their daily lives as they face the pressures of a hostile world. he also wants the Church to have a vision fro what it is and what it can do. So he prays that they may know God's </p>

<blockquote><div>incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way" (Eph 1.19-23).</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>"Angels, authorities and powers in submission to him"</b><br><br>In the verse with which we started our discussion on the Ascension cf (Coloured Supplement May 2003) - 1 Pet 3:22 - we are told that Christ "has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand - with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him." In Ephesians we are told that Christ is "far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given". What are these "authorities and power"? Are they the structures of society, as some say; or are they actual political rulers; or are they demonic forces behind both the structures and the rulers?<br><br>There has been much debate over these questions. Michael Green reminds us of "the flexibililty of such terms as 'principalities' and 'powers' in the usage of the New Testament. They do, on occasion, refer to human authorities. They do, for the main part, refer to super human agencies in the spiritual world."<br><br>The New Testament clearly believes in "the Devil" - "the slanderer". It implies that the evil in the world is not to be accounted for by the sum total of individual misdeeds. There is an "extra". And the Bible encourages us to think of that "extra" in personal terms - a "he", not an "it". But the Devil can then be seen to be steering other more neutral forces.<br><br>Therefore whatever the precise interpretation of "authorities" and "powers" is, we shall not go far wrong if we say this: that all demonic forces, all political forces, all economic forces, all sociological forces, all natural forces, indeed "every title [or name] that can be given", are subject to Christ. Jesus is "far above all". That was the New Testament's unshakeable conviction. Nothing could or can thwart the purposes of Christ. This in turn gave and still gives wonderful hope and assurance. "Who", asks Paul,</p>

<blockquote><div>shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword ... ? No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom 8.35,37-9).</div></blockquote>

<p>So let's remember these things when we say, in the Apostles' Creed, Jesus Christ "descended to the dead. On the third say he rose again, He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father."<br><br>[Edited extracts from Where did Jesus go? by David Holloway (Marshalls, London, 1983) pp 111-116, 145-148.]<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="God-Given Rights">(August 2003) God-Given Rights</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2003</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>British Airways and Gay Pride</b><br><br>On Monday 28 July [2003] The Times newspaper had the headline reporting the words of Rod Eddington, the British Airways' chief executive: "We have no God-given right to survive." He issued this warning and referred to "God-given rights" after the walk out by check-in staff and the loss of millions of pounds-worth of business.<br><br>The day before newspapers were reporting the Gay Pride event in London. For the first time, with the blessing of the police authorities, "gay police came out with pride." Prominent in the event was Commander Brian Paddick, Britain's highest ranking openly gay officer. Paddick, you may remember, was removed from his post at Lambeth after the Metropolitan Police Authority wrote to him saying he "demonstrated lack of judgment". This was following allegations by his ex-boyfriend that he allowed cannabis to be used at his home. <br><br>But - it is claimed - there are gay "rights". So, of course, the Commander should get top billing. Others undoubtedly claim a "right" to take cannabis. Indeed, many activities that others classify as wrong or immoral are today being claimed as "rights". Laws are then being annulled or passed to enforce these "rights" while often proposals to underline "God-given rights" are not passed. For example, in July in the wake of the Government's determination to repeal Section 28 - the law banning local councils from promoting homosexuality - the House of Lords failed to pass a proposal of Lady Blatch to give strong safeguards for parents in place of Section 28 (of the two bishops present the Bishop of Newcastle voted against and the Bishop of Manchester voted for the proposal). <br><br>What, therefore, are "rights"? How do they differ from "moral" or "God-given rights"? Is there a difference? Can you claim "a right" to anything? People, today, are certainly trying!<br><br><br><b>God-given or moral rights</b><br><br>Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), the English utilitarian philosopher, described the idea of moral rights as "nonsense upon stilts". To such people rights are mere human conventions. To them there are no moral rights or absolute rights as a divine gift because there is no divine giver. <br><br>Now this is not to deny there may be legal rights. These, of course, come from enactments of Parliament; and because they have the backing of the courts and the police, they can be enforced. So in reality they just come from the wishes (or whims) of MPs. Such rights are human creations and nothing more, unless, as believers claim, they coincide with God-given rights.<br><br>The concept of "human rights", as it has developed in the Western democratic world with its rule of law, was rooted in a firm belief in an absolute, God-given moral law. This, if you like, is a "primary law" behind all human laws. Paul's words in his letter to the Romans (chapter 2.14-15) have been crucial in this thinking:</p>

<blockquote><div>when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.</div></blockquote>

<p>Theologians refer to this as part of God's general revelationwhich comes through nature and in the human conscience. This parallels God's common grace - "your Father in heaven," said Jesus, "causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous" (Mt 5.45). <br><br>General revelation and common grace, however, are to be distinguished from God's special revelation found now in the Bible and his saving grace seen at the Cross and received through faith in Christ alone. So the good news (or the "gospel") relates to that special revelation and saving grace. But it has to preached in the context of God's general revelation and common grace.<br><br><br><b>Greek and Roman formulations of "natural law"</b><br><br>Paul, in all probability, knew the consensus of the Greeks and the Romans over what they termed "natural law" or "the law of nature". Cicero, Seneca and the Roman jurists were clear and so was the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Referring to this natural law, Cicero says </p>

<blockquote><div>it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting ... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for He is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment.</div></blockquote>

<p>With Paul confirming this pagan consensus, the early post-apostolic church accepted the concept of a universal standard of conduct, morally binding on all men, and intuited potentially by all. It then came to be a fundamental part of jurisprudence and political philosophy. And Christians saw that God had made this eternal law clearer in the Ten Commandments after sin had dulled human perceptions. But there was no fundamental disagreement. It all seemed obvious to the majority of Christians. At the Reformation for the most part the Reformers accepted much of the inherited teaching of the Roman Catholic church on natural law. They gave, however, different emphases. <br><br><br><b>The Reformers</b><br><br>The Continental Reformer Calvin defined natural law as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>natural law is that apprehension of the conscience which distinguishes sufficiently between just and unjust, and which deprives men of the excuse of ignorance while it proves them guilty by their own testimony." </div></blockquote>

<p>The Anglican Reformer Hooker sometimes used the term "the law of reason" instead of "natural law". Commenting on Romans 2.14 he says Paul's meaning</p>

<blockquote><div>... is, that by force of the light of reason wherewith God illuminateth everyone which cometh into the world, men, being enabled to know the truth from falsehood and good from evil, do thereby learn in many things what the will of God is; which will himself not revealing by any extraordinary means unto them, but they by natural discourse attaining the knowledge thereof, seem the makers of those laws which indeed are his, and they but only the finders of them out.</div></blockquote>

<p>Hooker, like Calvin, knew that men could and did "suppress the truth by their wickedness" and natural law was not the gospel. But they both knew it was a fact. So did John Locke at the end of the 17th century. "It is certain there is such a law [the law of nature], and that, too, as intelligible and plain to a rational creature and a studier of that law as the positive laws of commonwealths [laws voted by parliaments]."<br><br><br><b>The early "modern" period</b><br><br>Then in the 18th century "human rights" came to the fore in connection with natural law - not unreasonably as many basic rights were being denied. You had the classic statement of human rights in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, the basis of which were "the Laws of Nature and Nature's God". A few years later you had the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789. Significantly it lost entirely the concept of natural law and the connection of human rights with divine law. This declaration was "deist". Deism was a religion that was anti-Christian and posited just a "supreme being" who really took little interest in the day to day world. So these French rights were merely asserted (interestingly Bentham was made a citizen of the French Republic in 1792). The Declaration was so different from the American Declaration. There Thomas Jefferson wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</div></blockquote>

<p>He subsequently wrote that this was in the tradition of "the elementary books of public right as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke ... etc." So, why the difference?<br><br>America, a few years earlier, had experienced the Great Awakening, with the ministry of men like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield. The American Revolution was not anti-Christian at all. But the French Revolution was very different. It was influenced by deists or very secular Enlightenment thinkers like Diderot, the philosopher and editor of the Encyclopédie (1751-80). He was, indeed, anti-Christian. He famously wanted to "strangle the last king with the entrails of the last priest" and claimed that "posterity is for the philosopher what the other world is for the religious."<br><br>Not surprisingly, with the rejection of God-given natural law to ground God-given natural or human rights, rights theories collapsed along with an interest in natural law in continental Europe in the 19th century. This interest really only revived with the Second World War. People realized that terrible Nazi laws and executive decisions had to be judged by a higher law. This higher law could then give grounding to genuine human rights. So the Nuremberg Trials gave rise to the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. <br><br>However, the modern concern with "civil rights" was generated by the Rev. Martin Luther King in the 1960s, not with the United Nations Declaration. Without a renewed faith in "Nature's God" the UN Declaration did not get off to a good start.<br><br><br><b>Martin Luther King</b><br><br>Martin Luther King was a Baptist minister who first came to national attention in 1955 as the leader of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott. This began when a black passenger refused to give up her seat to a white passenger. He was also one of the organizers of the 200,000 strong march on Washington DC in 1963 to demand racial equality. A moderate (and so criticized by black militants) he was nevertheless imprisoned by the authorities for his campaigning. He was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.<br><br>With his Christian background, King's civil rights were rooted in what he called "our Judaeo-Christian heritage". Writing from Birmingham, Alabama, gaol, he penned these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.</div></blockquote>

<p>That American Dream was spelled out by Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed the slaves in 1863 and who also was assassinated. Writing in 1857 of those who had written the Declaration of Independence, he said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>they defined with tolerable distinctness, in what respects they did consider all men created equal – equal in 'certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly laboured for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colours everywhere.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Just and unjust laws</b><br><br>Lincoln was saying that there are objective, timeless principles of justice, by which you measure the human creation of laws and statutes, which at any given point may be less than desirable. He knew that there were just laws and unjust laws. But to distinguish the two you need a higher law by which to judge them. This was Martin Luther King's point:</p>

<blockquote><div>Now, what is the difference between the two [just and unjust laws]? … To put it in the terms of St Thomas Aquinas: an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust [Genesis teaching that man is made in the image of God, proves this]. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority … Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful.</div></blockquote>

<p>But what has happened since Martin Luther King? In the 1970's various "liberation" movements saw their chance. They sought to identify with the "race card" and played it for all it was worth. And such was the beginning of "Gay Liberation". There was, however, a significant difference between King and the Gay Liberationists. King had been asking for "human" not "black" rights. He was claiming the right of blacks to join in the human family. But the Gay Liberationists were demanding the "gay" right to a form of behaviour that was considered by the vast majority as not only deviant but dangerous. Furthermore it was clearly contrary to the Natural Law tradition which since St Paul had been infused with the basic teachings from Biblical ethics.<br><br><br><b>After King</b><br><br>This is how Robert George, the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University sees what has happened after Martin Luther King:</p>

<blockquote><div>After King's martyrdom many in the civil rights movement lost the moral compass that King's philosophy of natural law and natural rights provided. As traditional liberalism collapsed under the radical critique that has produced such phenomena as post-modernism, deconstructionism, radical feminism and the like, many veterans of the civil rights struggle bought into the moral radicalism of what … [has been] accurately labelled a 'cultural elite'. For this elite, 'natural law' is a mere euphemism for legitimizing the status quo, thus reinforcing structures of domination and power. At the same time, elite opinion rejects as, at best, benighted the idea of objective moral truth. Thus no truly rational critique of racism and other forms of unjust discrimination is possible. There is [now], quite simply, the brute struggle for power.</div></blockquote>

<p>George does not spell out the "radical critique". To do so we must go back to continental Europe and the 19th century. Without the evangelical revival that Britain and America experienced in the 18th and 19th centuries, both France and Germany were open to spiritual attack. In Germany this came not only in the form of theological liberalism; it also came in the form of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900). He was a German philosopher who rejected the absolute moral standards of the Bible and what he called the "slave morality" of Christianity. He was the one who said "God is dead". So all is permitted and people are free to create their own values. "Let us therefore limit ourselves ... to the creation of our own new tables of values ... We, however, want to be those who we are - the new, unique, the incomparable, those who give themselves their own law, those who create themselves." He spoke about the "transvaluation of values".<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Nietzsche has had a slow but pernicious effect on Western culture. He is the God-Father of post-modernism. And post-modernism with its relativity and pluralism is what the Bible and traditional theology calls "worldliness". David Wells puts it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>what today we know as modernity [and especially post-modernity] is, in many ways, giving contemporary expression to what the New Testament pejoratively calls 'the world'. Worldiness is that system of values, in any given age, which has as its centre our fallen human perspective, which displaces God and his truth from the world, and which makes sin look normal and righteousness seem strange. It thus gives great plausibility to what is morally wrong and, for that reason, makes what is wrong seem normal. It is this spiritual reality that is pervasive in modernity.</div></blockquote>

<p>A great disciple of Nietzche in more recent times was the French intellectual Michel Foucault (1926-84). In 1953 he read Nietzsche for the first time, he says, with "a great passion". He then created his own values of gay and sadomasochistic sex. He claimed sadomasochistic sex was "a kind of creation, a creative enterprise" in which participants invented new selves by exploring "new possibilities of pleasure". He eventually died of AIDS, which his lover said he saw as one of these "limit experiences". And Foucault had a great influence on the late 20th century and still influences thinking about homosexuality, which in the world (and the church) is both the focus and the symptom of wider issues, as we have seen.<br><br>The widest issue, of course, is that of submission to, or rejection of, almighty God. So what are Christians to do? We are to pray and evangelize, and where possible have our say in public life. As we do all that we must not teach (and think) about sin and salvation in a vacuum but in the context of God's moral holiness, his sovereignty, his providence and his creative purposes, with Jesus still his agent in creation (Col 1.17). It is these aspects of God's character that relate to his natural (or primary) law and those God given rights that flow from it. And we must always remember that being our loving creator his will and his plan and so his law is good, for us and for all. It is foolish to disobey.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn">(September 2003) Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2003</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The forgotten man</b><br><br>Forty years ago on 28 August 1963 Martin Luther King, the US black civil rights leaders, delivered a speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. It has been called his "I have a dream" speech from his hopes that were expressed as a series of dreams. Martin Luther King and this speech are justly famous and rightly remembered today. So the BBC celebrated this fortieth anniversary at the end of August. But another man, probably of even greater stature and significance, and a man with even greater literary skills than King, is little celebrated. Indeed, he is positively rejected. Yet he contributed to the restoration of freedom for millions in the second half of the 20th century. The man is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who was a key player in the dismemberment of the "evil empire" of Stalin and his successors in the USSR.<br><br>Why is there such a difference of treatment between King and Solzhenitsyn? One answer is that the secular, liberal agenda of many who shape Western culture has been grafted on to Martin Luther King's call for "civil rights" (see Coloured Supplement August 2003). So it has been important for these secular elites to fête King and claim him a "patron" for their own enterprise of extending (his) legitimate "civil rights" to cover a host of (their) illegitimate rights - from the (so called) "right" to homosexual adoption, to the "right" to have a child at any moral cost, to the "right" to dispose of an unwanted child, and to other "rights" associated with the "culture of death". Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who at first was celebrated as a great Russian liberal, came to be seen as opposed to such an agenda. He, therefore, is forgotten. <br><br>The significance of Solzhenitsyn must not be underestimated. This can be seen from a Soviet-era joke that was set in the future and had a school teacher asking the class who was Leonid Brezhnev. A pupil then puts up a hand and replies: "wasn't he some insignificant politician in the age of Solzhenitsyn?"<br><br>As a boy, as a university student, then as a soldier in World War II Solzhenitsyn was an avowed Marxist. But in 1945 he was arrested for criticizing Stalin. For this he spent eight years imprisoned in forced labour camps in the Arctic and then three years in enforced exile until 1956. He then settled in central Russia, became a maths teacher and began to write. But he had met in prison Christian believers. This led him to move from Marx to Jesus - the Jesus of his Russian Orthodox forefathers: "God of the Universe!" he wrote, "I believe again! Though I renounced You, You were with me."<br><br>Solzhenitsyn received world-wide publicity during a brief Soviet thaw in 1962. This was when he was allowed to publish his short masterpiece One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. The story told of the brutality of Soviet prison life in a typical day in the life of an inmate of one of Stalin's forced-labour camps. But this period of official favour did not last long. So he had to use the literary "underground". He also managed to publish abroad, where by the late 1960's he was acclaimed as the new Tolstoy. <br><br>After receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970, he published in Paris in 1974 The Gulag Archipelago, his history of Soviet prison camps. Immediately Solzhenitsyn was attacked in the Soviet press. On 12 February 1974 he was arrested and the following day exiled as a traitor.<br><br><br><b>In the West</b><br><br>Solzhenitsyn started his twenty years of exile in Zurich, where he continued to write and publish. He then moved in 1976 to the US where he generally kept out of the limelight as he tried to finish what he reckoned his greatest work, The Red Wheel, a cycle of books retelling Russian history. "The main cause of the ruinous [Bolshevik] Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our people", he wrote, was that "men have forgotten God." He argued that forgetting God was also, "the principal trait of the entire twentieth century." However, in 1978 he agreed to give the commencement address at Harvard University. This proved something of a bombshell. The West's emphasis on secular rights, he told the Harvard students, had produced societies that now stood at the brink of "the abyss of human decadence ... It is time in the West to defend not so much human rights as human obligations." Solzhenistsyn concluded with these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>If the world has not approached its end, it has reached a major watershed in history, equal in importance to the turn from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. It will demand from us a spiritual blaze, we shall have to rise to a new height of vision, to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the Middle Ages, but even more importantly, our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the Modern Era.</div></blockquote>

<p>This was not what many of his audience wanted to hear. But these had long been his views. He held that "untouched by the breadth of God, unrestricted by human conscience both capitalism and socialism are repulsive." <br><br>At home he had attacked the Soviet leaders for trying to eradicate "Christian religion and morality" and then substituting an ideology with atheism as its "chief inspirational and emotional hub". In the West he was attacking the liberal elites for discarding "the moral heritage of Christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice" and for substituting "the proclaimed and practical autonomy of man from any higher force above him."<br><br>So now many Western intellectuals turned against him. The Washington Post said Solzhenitsyn was unbalanced and fit to live only under totalitarian regimes. One commentator called Solzhenitsyn "a freak." Western liberals could no longer consider Solzhenitsyn "one of us". An exception to this rejection was Malcolm Muggeridge:</p>

<blockquote><div>What amazing perceptiveness on his part to have realized straight away, as he did, that the true cause of the West's decline and fall was precisely the loss of a sense of the distinction between good and evil, and so of any moral order in the universe, without which no order at all, individual or collective, is attainable ... Solzhenitsyn sees Western man sleepwalking into the same servitude that in the Soviet Union had been imposed by force. On campuses and the TV screen, in the newspapers and the magazines, often from the pulpits even, the message is being proclaimed: Man is now in charge of his own destiny and capable of creating a kingdom of heaven on earth in accordance with his own specifications, without any need for a God to worship or a Saviour to redeem him or a Holy Spirit to exalt him. How truly extraordinary that the most powerful and prophetic voice exploding this fantasy, Solzhenitsyn's, should come from the very heart of godlessness and materialism after more than sixty years of the most intense and thoroughgoing indoctrination in the opposite direction ever attempted.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>The return</b><br><br>In 1988 Mikhail Gorbachev became the president of the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall was dismantled. And in 1994 Solzhenitsyn returned home, but to a Russia very different to the one he had left. Ian Hunter describes it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>In Moscow the statue of Aleksandr Pushkin looked out on McDonald's. There existed a voracious market for Western porn. It was Charles Bronson's Death Wish, not the movie version of Ivan Denisovich, that flew off the video shelves. A British journalist made a search of Moscow's largest bookstore but was unable to find a single copy of any of Solzhenitsyn's novels. For a short time, Solzhenitsyn had a weekly fifteen minute television programme called 'Meetings with Solzhenitsyn.' In a few months it was dropped due to viewer uninterest, replaced by a programme featuring the Italian parliamentarian and porn queen, La Cicciolina. In fact Solzhenitsyn had returned to a new kind of exile, the wasteland of post-modern Russia" (Touchstone July /Aug 2003 - I am also grateful to Hunter for a number of my Solzhenitsyn quotations).Nearly 85, how does he now see the future and the world? First, he faces death with confidence: "[Death] will be just a peaceful transition. As a Christian, I believe there is life after death." But he has less confidence in modern Russia with its new decadence: "It is as if, just having survived the heaviest case of cholera, immediately upon recuperation [you] get the plague." And with regard to the modern world, he believes that one of its defining marks is "the loss of the ability to answer the principal problem of life and death. People are prepared to stuff their heads with anything, and to talk of any subject, but only to block off the contemplation of this subject." </div></blockquote>

<p>The elites may have forgotten Solzhenitsyn "the last remaining prophet in the abandoned temple of absolute truth" (as one Russian writer has described him). But whatever faults he may have had, he should not be forgotten. David Remnick, editor of New Yorker, wrote of Solzhenitsyn:</p>

<blockquote><div>No writer that I can think of in history, really was able to do so much through courage and literary skill to change the society they came from. And to some extent, you have to credit the literary works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn with helping to bring down the last empire on earth.</div></blockquote>

                <p>1) The Church of England itself, like the wider Anglican Communion is facing a crisis that compares with the 16th century Reformation. Bishop Stephen Sykes speaks of de facto or de iure schism. Is such a development inevitable? Sykes says it "seems to me that, humanly speaking, it is very probable."<br><br>2) Richard Hooker, the 16th century Anglican theologian, defined the Church as both "a society and a society supernatural". Churches do not cease to be human societies because they are Christian. So, organizational realities as well as divine realities are important for churches. Four things are required of any organization (including a church) for it to succeed – an agreed agenda, competent leadership, enabling structures and client sensitivity.<br><br>3) The division spoken about in the Church of England and the Anglican Communion is occurring because there is no real agreed agenda. For example, in a 2002 survey published recently by Christian Research as Believe it or not! – what Church of England clergy actually believe, there was found, I quote,</p>

<blockquote><div>the existence side-by-side of two separate churches under the cloak of Anglicanism. One of these is essentially credally orthodox and committed to the historic faith and Apostolic mission of the Church; the other is wrapped in the garments of Christian language, but has only the most tenuous grasp of the central teachings of the faith.</div></blockquote>

<p>4) The Church of England is committed to principled comprehensiveness –</p>

<blockquote><div>agreement on fundamentals, while tolerating disagreement on matters in which Christians may differ without feeling the necessity of breaking communion" (Lambeth Conference 1968). </div></blockquote>

<p>5) The fundamentals for the Church of England are (constitutionally) summarized in Canon A5 which states:</p>

<blockquote><div>The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures and in such teaching of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal.</div></blockquote>

<p>6) While there may be dispute with regard to particular fundamentals, the Church of England, unlike some churches, has nevertheless been committed to the distinction between essentials and secondary issues. It has held that while some things considered by some as fundamental are disputable, others, if there is an honest and rational commitment to the Holy Scriptures and those subordinate authorities cited in Canon A5, are clearly central and not marginal. <br><br>7) The prohibition against homosexual intercourse and the concomitant general sexual morality is such a central and non marginal fundamental prohibition. The Church of England bishops have concluded there is …</p>

<blockquote><div>in Scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong, monogamous, heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings. Sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable" (Issues in Human Sexuality p 18).</div></blockquote>

<p>8) The present crisis springs from some leaders, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, denying that this sexual ethic is fundamental but secondary and so homosexual practice can be permitted. At a Primates' Meeting in Portugal he asked "the bare question" as he put it – </p>

<blockquote><div>are we really prepared to say that Christians who are united in their affirmation of a single baptism in the threefold name of the Trinity, of the authority of Scripture in matters of doctrine, of the creeds of the undivided Church, and of Episcopal ministry are not mutually recognizable to one another as Christians when they differ on matters of sexual ethics?</div></blockquote>

<p>9) Richard Hooker would argue that that was an improper question. He would answer by distinguishing schism, heresy and apostasy. Apostates he would not recognize as Christians. He would, however, recognize schismatics and heretics as schismatical and heretical Christians. The latter are to be "recognized", but so far as they are unrepentant over their teaching of sexual immorality, not to be tolerated. The risen Christ says to the Church at Thyatira:</p>

<blockquote><div>I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality" (Rev 2.20)</div></blockquote>

<p>10) General appeals to "the authority of Scripture" in the current pluralistic church carry little weight. Theology engaging with post modernism can result in a reader-response approach to the bible, where texts no longer mean what they say. In a recent book prefaced by the Archbishop of Canterbury, it is suggested that we have to be uprooted "from the comfortable and unchallenged notion that it is possible to reach agreement on the clear meaning of the biblical texts."<br><br>11) The Anglican doctrine is, however, that of the general "perspicuity" of the Scriptures:</p>

<blockquote><div>Although many things in the Scripture be spoken in obscure mysteries, yet there is nothing spoken under dark mysteries in one place, but the self-same thing in other places is spoken more familiarly and plainly, to the capacity both of learned and unlearned" (A fruitful exhortation to the Reading of Holy Scripture, Homilies 1.i).</div></blockquote>

<p>Without such a belief there is a practical loss of the Scriptures and there can be no agreed agenda.<br><br>12) Not surprisingly the Church of England seems lacking in competent leadership. With such doctrinal indiscipline corporate leadership at the diocesan and parish level will often be at the "lowest common denominator". We now know the following – that …</p>

<blockquote><div>… 18 percent of the clergy do not believe "in God the Father who created the world"; 47 percent do not believe "that Jesus Christ was born of a Virgin"; 25 percent do not believe "that Jesus Christ died to take away the sins of the world;" 46 percent do not believe "that Jesus Christ physically rose from the dead"; 49 percent do not believe "that faith in Jesus Christ is the only way by which we can be saved"; 23 percent do not believe "that the Holy Spirit is a person who empowers Christians today" (Christian Research, op cit). </div></blockquote>

<p>13) The leaders acceptable to such a constituency will normally be those tolerant of such a wide spectrum and so by definition theologically liberal. <br><br>14) The Church of England is in serious decline. Currently 50 percent of churches are declining with 30 percent growing – but these are mostly in Evangelical and Anglo-Catholic parishes. In the 1990s the truly significant growth was that of "mainstream" (as distinct from "broad" or "charismatic") Evangelicals and, it would seem, represented by members of the Reform network. They saw a massive 320 percent growth but from a very small base. Over all, however, the Church of England faces "slow death", a situation not unknown in large secular corporations and industries. <br><br>15) Where there is "slow death", the majority in leadership follow a policy of "peace and pay", maintaining the status quo and not "rocking the boat". This is to cope with slow death by choosing slow death. Others follow a strategy of "active exit" – in the church that means leaving the ministry or changing denominations. <br><br>16) "Deep Change" is the only solution to "slow death". To quote one management consultant, this …</p>

<blockquote><div>… happens only when someone cares enough to exercise the courage to uncover the issues no one dares to recognize or confront. It means someone must be enormously secure and courageous." </div></blockquote>

<p>It will involve, when right, "breaking the rules" (for some of the rules are strangling the organization to death); risking your job; and, in the words of a management metaphor, "walking naked into the land of uncertainty" – there will be no simple "business plan":<br><br>17) "Deep Change" leaders are transformatory leaders. Such are needed for movements of "revitalization". Such were Wesley and Whitefield. According to social scientists:</p>

<blockquote><div>revitalization movements prosper when leaders arise who clearly articulate the cultural crisis … [but] such leaders can serve transformation or reaction. They can embody the needed revitalization or a reactionary fundamentalism tied to old shibboleths." </div></blockquote>

<p>18) This is the crisis for the Evangelical constituency at the moment. Many leaders in the "orthodox" Church of England are following a reactionary path. Their goal seems to be to recreate a present similar to an idealized past when there was a legitimate Anglican comprehensiveness – in the late 1950's prior to the dissolution of the 1960's – the days of the young Mr Stott and his important university missions; the young Dr Packer and his slow but significant erudition and the ebullient Mr Green and his infectious enthusiasm. It is a strategy of reform through rational pleading and ever greater involvement in existing structures. <br><br>19) Some must follow that strategy. It will not, however, reverse the course of "slow death". The past was not so wonderful - it has given us the present! And the present culture is so different from the past that 1950's patterns and solutions often will be irrelevant. The experts say:</p>

<blockquote><div>revitalization moves beyond reaction only when these movements include adherents who are willing to experiment with new cultural forms.</div></blockquote>

<p>20) At the denominational level the Church of England, along with the majority of mainline denominations is dysfunctional. In the 16th century the Church of England was evolving into a federation of churches connected by the Crown, the episcopate, the Prayer Book and the Thirty-nine Articles. By the 18th century denominations became a reality as new federations were formed, linked by whatever made them distinctive – presbyteries, independency, baptismal practice or the Quaker ethic. In the 19th century, with the growth of Evangelicalism and the missionary movements followed by the need for social and educational organizations, denominations became "corporations". <br><br>21) These lasted until the undisciplined theological innovations of the 1960's. Then the evaporation of the old theological consensus meant denominations "as corporations" could no longer work on behalf of those they represented. The denominations now became simply centralized "regulatory agencies". Their function is little more than to hold budgets and try to tell people what they can or cannot do. The result – denominational breakdown. <br><br>22) Churches are "voluntary non-profit organizations", with no sanctions or power, certainly not over the laity. The new denominational regulatory agencies, therefore, have a problem. Lay people who are Bible believing and can administer multimillion pound companies, perform sophisticated surgical operations, or lead modern educational institutions do not take kindly to less than brilliant clergy (even if they are bishops or moderators) or clericalized lay people telling them, from denominational headquarters, what to believe or how much to give in support of causes of which they disapprove.<br><br>23) The Church of England, of course, is not a denomination grounded in "synods" or structures. Nor is it grounded in the bishops – a claim made in the 19th century. It is grounded, constitutionally, in the Holy Scriptures and its social embodiment is in the local congregation (Article XIX). <br><br>24) In terms of planning, wise Christians pray for miracles and plan on likelihoods. The likelihood is that no solution to the slow death of the Church of England (or to the problems of the Anglican Communion) will come from the centre and the existing leadership. <br><br>25) The solution will come – and is coming - informally at first, from a new federal structure of autonomous local Anglican churches but united together under members of the historic episcopate who confess the historic doctrines of the Church of England as enshrined in Canon A5. These churches are especially likely to develop in dioceses where there is teaching in support of the homosexual agenda, or where there is support for open homosexual relationships among the clergy.<br><br>26) Nor are such churches out of line with a 2002 resolution from the Anglican Primates' Meeting in Canterbury, 10-17 April 2002 (section 7):</p>

<blockquote><div>Primates need to be open to the development of new patterns of ministry within the inherited legal framework of our tradition – for example, non-geographical networks within our geographically structured dioceses, and perhaps even transcending diocesan boundaries along the lines of the work of religious orders with specific ministry commitments." </div></blockquote>

<p>Now in 2003, developments are needed outside "the inherited legal framework". In the recent words of the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, there will be "new alignments" and a "weakening of territorial jurisdiction". He says, it will be "messy as far as all this is concerned." <br><br>27) Following the Worship and Doctrine Measure 1974 there is a clear duty not only on bishops but also on clergy to "banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God's Word". <br><br>28) Since the "heresy" trials of the 19th century, where at one and the same time cases were won but causes were lost, the use of the courts to restrain heretical bishops is no longer an option for maintaining sound doctrine. This was finally decided by Evangelical clergy at the time of the former Bishop of Durham and his denials of the virginal conception and his doubts of the empty tomb. That, however, did not excuse those clergy from the obligations of the last section of Article XXVI which recognizes that …</p>

<blockquote><div>… sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments … Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just judgment be deposed.</div></blockquote>

<p>Without recourse to the courts, "messy" options are all that remain. To be "regular" in doctrine, clergy and churches are now having to be "irregular" in matters of order. They now have to rely on the judgment of God and of history.<br><br>29) The imperative of "getting the gospel out" and the need to be "client sensitive" means that leaders – in parishes especially - need a radical willingness to experiment in terms of structures and methodologies. There simply needs to be an adherence to the fundamental principles enshrined in Canon A5.<br><br>30) Getting the gospel out – evangelism - is the primary goal after the worship of God. The concern for "maintaining" the gospel and guarding it is also an imperative. There is a direct connection between false teaching and spiritual blindness. The resistance to the former Bishop of Durham in the North East was because local churches found their own evangelism undermined by the bishop's doctrinal denials.<br><br>31) St Paul's address to the Ephesian elders reminds us that his ministry was characterized by "serving the Lord with great humility and with tears." And he knew that being faithful to Jesus Christ meant opposition. But he believed the gospel was worth dying for.</p>

<blockquote><div>I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me – the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.</div></blockquote>

<p>32) The gospel to be got out has to be the "gospel of God's grace". That is why Evangelicals are committed to staying in the Church of England defined not by its synods but by its doctrine. They want to see it disciplined to a principled comprehensiveness with those promoting heresy split off until they repent or believe. Evangelicals believe that the Thirty-nine Articles, embedded in Canon A5 contain a good statement of this "gospel of God's grace". They believe, too, that the Church of England as constituted is committed to the "whole will of God".<br><br>33) St Paul tells the leaders of the church: "keep watch over yourselves" – it is always easier to see the faults in others – "and over all the flock". The reason for such watchfulness over the flock is, he says, because …</p>

<blockquote><div>after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth.</div></blockquote>

<p>34) Leaders need to be competent in their ability to "fight the wolf". Nor at the moment are these "savage wolves" who "distort the truth" just in episcopal churches in the US and Canada. They are also in the Church of England. Sadly and seriously, the Archbishop of Canterbury, while still maintaining that homosexual intercourse in certain circumstances is compatible with Christian discipleship, is "distorting the truth". So, too, is the Bishop of Oxford and all those bishops who have written in support of Jeffrey John – a man who aggressively teaches the rightness of homosexual sex and has not repented of his former lifestyle.<br><br>35) Paul did not speak about structures to the Ephesian elders. But his appointment of elders indicates the importance of structured leadership in the church. There is a need, therefore, for those in dioceses where there is impaired communion with the bishop over the homosexual issue to make alternative provision. <br><br>36) Evangelicals wanting to prevent the "slow death" of the Church of England will want their senior leaders to be validly ordained, if irregularly so. Hence the need in some areas for alternative episcopal oversight and new arrangements for succession. With regard to any new structures, these will usually follow new life rather than precede it. <br><br>37) It is always easier to give birth than raise the dead. That is why around the country there are many signs of new life. At such a time it is particularly important to remember that the majority of Bishops have not publicly supported the homosexual cause. We should not assume opposition where there is none. Also Christian Research has shown that half the clergy are orthodox – that must include many who do not class themselves as "Evangelical".<br><br>38) Until there is public repentance and a change of belief there must be impaired communion with those who "distort the truth". This seems to some unnecessarily rigorous. That is because currently there is a loss of "outrage". <br><br>39) In 1979 I was on the Board for Social Responsibility and we had the first report on homosexuality entitled Homosexual Relationships. It is unthinkable that at that time even middle of the road churchmen, let alone Evangelicals, would have invited to open their Congress a person who publicly admits to ordaining a man who he knew had a homosexual partner and who acknowledges, I quote, "that 'conforming your life … to Christ' doesn't necessarily mean giving up a homosexual lifestyle."<br><br>40) Last summer I signed a letter to the Prime Minister along with Mark Ashton, Richard Bewes, Jonathan Fletcher, Angus Macleay, Hugh Palmer, Vaughan Roberts and William Taylor. We said:</p>

<blockquote><div>such actions and views fly in the face of the clear teaching of the Holy Scriptures and the resolutions of the Lambeth Conference 1998. Rowan Williams would not have the confidence of the vast majority of Anglicans in the world, who are now in the third world and who, as loyal Anglicans, take the Holy Scriptures as their supreme authority. His appointment would lead to a major split in the Anglican Communion (including the Church of England).</div></blockquote>

<p>41) If we do not take initiatives ourselves – but assume that Rowan Williams will sort out the problems at a Primates' Meeting – we are living in "cloud-cuckoo-land". The fundamental issue, which is the presenting problem and behind which are many more crucial issues, is the homosexual issue. Rowan Williams, however, believes that these matters of sexual ethics are not fundamental and church defining. We and the majority of the Anglican Communion believe they are.<br><br>42) There is a point at which we must say, "thus far and no further." If a bishop said that Jews or Muslims should be put in gas-chambers, some would still invite him to open their Congress. Such an issue was real for the members of the Confessing Church in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and they stood firm while the "German Christians", however, compromised. <br><br>43) In the 1990's such an issue faced Anglicans in Rwanda. We now know that the previous Archbishop of Rwanda compromised over the genocide. He was rightly disciplined, with pressure from the former Archbishop of Canterbury. But why should white European and North American bishops and archbishops have the privilege of indiscipline, when black African bishops and archbishops do not? This surely is a form of racism! Praise God, for the current uncompromising Archbishop of Rwanda who has shown courage against hostility from other bishops in doing what is right and consecrating missionary bishops to evangelise and minister in the area of the decadent ECUSA, through the Anglican Mission in America.<br><br>44) There is a point, too, where we must say, "thus far and no further" in terms of the Church of England's establishment. If we are to be client sensitive with regard to the national Christian constituency, we must work for a measure of disestablishment. We cannot have Prince Charles as the supreme governor of the Church of England in the light of his relationship with Mrs Parker Bowles. <br><br>45) It would indeed be homophobic to confine sexual immorality to homosexuals and excuse heterosexual immorality. We need to be aware that liberal theologians in the Church of England are already supporting heterosexual immorality. A senior clergymen is now publicly proposing that the Church of England "abandon an undiscriminating opposition to pre-marital sexual intercourse".<br><br>46) Never again should we have the Prime Minister selecting an Archbishop of Canterbury. The choice of the Chairman of the Crown Appointments Commission for Canterbury is uniquely the Prime Minister's. This last time, the Prime Minister selected Dame Butler Schloss as chairman - a woman known for her public support of parenting by homosexuals. It is not surprising that Rowan Williams secured the nomination. On the previous occasion, the late Lord Caldecote chaired the Commission, an Evangelical and Thatcher appointee. It is not surprising that George Carey secured the nomination. But is this the right way to discover God's will? <br><br>47) The further erosion of the establishment will mean the loss of episcopal influence in the House of Lords. That is sad. But not infrequently their influence has been less than benign. For example, a little before the Bishop of Oxford had proposed Jeffrey John for Reading, he spoke in the Lords in support of, and so influenced the debate on, homosexual adoption. Many saw this as a terrible proposal that now means the use of vulnerable children in a project where research suggests there will be positive harm.<br><br>48) St Paul said to the Ephesian elders, "for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears." Currently we too must spend much time in "warning" as we seek to defend the "gospel of God's grace". However, this homosexual debate in the Church of England has been raging since 1979. The General Synod then voted massively for an orthodox position in 1987 only to find that the Bishops immediately sought to overturn the result with new working parties. They succeeded with the fog of Issues on Human Sexuality. After a quarter of a century the time, indeed, has come for an ending of the Church debate and for "deep change". <br><br>49) The needs of the world mean we must spend more time creatively in evangelism, church growth and church planting. But as Hebrews says in the context of living "in peace with all men" and of holiness and sexual morality:</p>

<blockquote><div>See to it that no-one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. See that no-one is sexually immoral.</div></blockquote>

<p>50) This deep change will come from "below". It needs to be patient, measured, thoughtful and not vindictive. To help with this process I am reconvening in November, after half a century, the Jesmond Conference. We will not be seeking headlines, rather careful "brain-storming sessions" with two overseas bishops as consultants. Our goal is not to demonize those with whom we disagree but to help each other to get the gospel out in the light of the social realities in both the church and the world.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Bible, its Truth, and the Christmas Story">(December 2003) The Bible, its Truth, and the Christmas Story</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2003</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>At Christmas millions will hear readings from the four Gospels in the New Testament. But how can we be sure that these accounts are true?<br><br>Over the last 200 years the Bible has come in for an unprecedented amount of criticism. But it is remarkable how well the Bible has stood the test. Emil Brunner tells an interesting story to prove the point:</p>

<blockquote><div>Two hundred years ago, scoffing Voltaire, probably the most famous man of his time prophesied that all would soon be over with the Bible. The house in which this boast was made is to-day one of the offices of a great Bible society. Voltaire's name is almost forgotten; the Bible has had, in the meantime, an incredible career of triumph throughout the world.</div></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps one of the greatest causes for distrusting the New Testament records is a common fallacy; and the Bible more than any other book has been subject to this. It is the fallacy that says that if you know about the origins of something and see that these are very different to the final product, you have explained away the final product.<br><br>It is amazing how powerfully destructive a knowledge of origins can be. But, of course, to know the origin of something is often irrelevant as far as its present value, truth or effectiveness is concerned. A man may be born in a log cabin. But if he ends up, like Abraham Lincoln did, as President of the United States, he is the President no matter what his origins. Modern astronomy may have evolved from astrological guesswork in ancient Babylon. But if some men can travel to the moon and back, it is clearly more than guesswork now. So it is with the Bible.<br><br>The four Gospels may well be the result of godly men in the mid-first century AD collecting earlier written sources as "Source Criticism" has suggested. Or the Gospels may have resulted in part from regularly told short stories from the life of Jesus as "Form Criticism" has suggested. And most probably the Gospel writers put their material together, from whatever source, to emphasize a particular truth about God's revelation of himself in Jesus Christ, as "Redaction-Criticism" has suggested. But by itself all this tells us nothing about whether what we have got as the final product is true or false. Something in the Gospel narrative may be said by the scholars to come "from 'Q' (a hypothetical collection of Jesus' teachings) or from 'M' (Matthew's special source)" or to come "in the 'Form of a miracle-story'". But by itself that tells us nothing as to whether what comes like that is true or false. The mere fact that the report of a miracle may be given in a stylized way tells us little. The question "Was there a miracle there in the first place?" is a different question from "How has the report of the alleged miracle come down to us?"<br><br><br><b>Tradition</b><br><br>The gospel of the resurrection of Jesus Christ was originally passed on by word of mouth. The Resurrection happened. The Apostles then spoke about it and "preached" it and they spoke about Jesus. Maybe some of them had taken down notes earlier of specific teachings of Jesus; but there is no record of these in the Acts of the Apostles. All we hear about is "preaching". All we can be certain of, until the Gospels themselves were composed, is an oral tradition. But such an oral tradition would have been nothing new. It would seem that there was an oral tradition in the Old Testament. You also get it in other ancient cultures. And from what we know of some of these, there is evidence of a very tight oral tradition. In the period of the passing on of material by word of mouth (before it is eventually written down) it is handed on in relatively careful ways. You can think, for example, of the ancient Greek Homeric poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey; here the verse form acts as a control. This can be paralleled at various stages of European literature.<br><br>Inevitably in the transmission of Old Testament material before it was written down there would have been stylization. That is to say, the way you tell one story is influenced by the way you tell a different story. Details may get lost. There is no evidence, however, that you can invent 'ad lib'. But - and it is a very big "but" - the New Testament is totally different to all of this. As has been well pointed out, "the period of the New Testament covers fewer decades than the Old Testament covers centuries." Eventually, after the initial preaching, the New Testament Gospels, or the sources behind, them came to be written down. What had been repeated orally by word of mouth was now in a manuscript (a hand-written document) and to that extent fixed.<br><br>But prior to that "fixing" had the "tradition" been radically modified? That is the big question. Had the oral tradition grown? Of course oral tradition can grow. The check, however, on the growth of any tradition is the fact of other people being around who know differently. They can let it be known that certain things are fiction. This means that the presence at large of "eyewitnesses" of any alleged event that has now become a "tradition" is of first rate importance.<br><br><br><b>Checks</b><br><br>This is relevant for our evaluation of the New Testament. Even at the end of the first century AD a few eyewitnesses of the ministry of Jesus and of the events surrounding his death and resurrection were still alive. There were many more who had known and spoken with eyewitnesses. They heard their reports of what they had seen and heard. "Some people seem to imagine that, after the initial telling of the story [of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus] every eyewitness immediately and for ever withdrew from the whole affair. The fact is that right up to the beginning of the stage of writing, and well on into it, there were in the church surviving eyewitnesses whose oversight of the tradition must have been sufficient to ensure substantial accuracy in its transmission."<br><br>It is clear that there were written accounts of the gospel events earlier than the four Gospels as we have them (Luke 1.1). And we have Paul's statement on the resurrection appearances in the first epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor 15.5-8). This was made ten or fifteen years earlier than the usual dating of Mark's Gospel. There were thus accounts of the Resurrection nearer to the events than the Gospels themselves. But leaving all that aside and just thinking about the finished product of Mark's Gospel, we need to remember that even this was published only thirty-five years or so after the Resurrection. That is about the same period as I have been vicar of Jesmond. I was instituted in January 1973. I can remember that quite vividly. I can remember many things from the 1970s at JPC. I could not necessarily give you a precise chronological account without looking at my diaries. But I could recount a lot of them as isolated events. Most important of all, if someone came along and said something major had happened at the church, when it hadn't, or totally misrepresented what had happened, I would be able to say they were talking nonsense. <br><br>And, of course, where there is a great deal of teaching by word of mouth memory becomes more important. It appears that the Jewish Rabbis employed memorizing techniques in their transmission of teaching. Clearly <br><br>Jesus was different to the other religious teachers of his day. We cannot assume that he copied their teaching techniques anymore than he copied their teaching. But in a culture where memory was important, a cavalier approach to the passing on of facts and information is not to be expected. In fact in such a culture memory is often developed to a high degree; and people have better memories than many of us have in our instant "electronic recall" world! This apparently is still true in parts of India where the training of the verbal memory is regarded as being very important.<br><br>Another check on the development of fictitious ideas and stories was the fact that the gospel was not private. This is very significant. It was the Gnostic sects that believed in "secret" revelations. It is not surprising that bizarre and obviously fictional stories about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus emerged from them. But the church under the Apostles believed that the gospel belonged to the church as a whole. There was something corporate about it. It was an "open secret".<br><br>There was a concern for the "unity" of the tradition. People wanted to check up on the facts. Paul himself wanted to consult with the Christians in Jerusalem. In one sense he was totally independent of Jerusalem and doing a quite separate work in his Gentile mission. But he decided early on to go up to Jerusalem to check things out. He decided to put before the leaders there "the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles ... for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain" (Gal 2.2). Paul clearly believed that he had received his commission and his gospel directly from the exalted Christ. He had not received it from the Jerusalem leaders (Gal 1.1). But he "checked it out" with them. There is no evidence for individual Christians in the early Apostolic church having "private" visions and on that basis generating "stories".<br><br><br><b>John's Gospel</b><br><br>The Gospels are four different accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They are quite unique in the history of literature. They are not biographies in the modern sense. A disproportionate amount of them is given over to the last week of Jesus' life. John says of what he has written in his Gospel, especially the "signs" - and the greatest sign is the Resurrection - that he has been selective. He has only written a fraction of what he could (John 21.25). He says: "these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20.31). John clearly had a theological purpose. But he is not for the moment suggesting he is fabricating "signs". He says he makes his theological points by selection from actual incidents and events - that is what he thought he was doing. There is not the slightest hint he was making his theological points by the creation of imagined incidents and events. But can we trust John?<br><br>John's Gospel had a famous "rehabilitation" in the mid 20th century. For many years it was said that John's Gospel was written late. It was said that the writer, whoever he was (and according to this view he certainly had nothing to do with the Apostle John of the twelve), just took Matthew, Mark and Luke and rewrote them! He rewrote the facts even! This was the reason, it was said, why John seems so different from the other three synoptic gospels ("synoptic" means literally "seeing together"). But the argument went on like this: if John could freely rewrite the other existing Gospels, why shouldn't those other three have done just the same thing with their sources? Why not, indeed?<br><br>Then Professor C.H.Dodd published Historical Tradition and the Fourth Gospel. He proved overwhelmingly that John was not dependent on the other Gospels for his sources. He did not rewrite them, therefore. He couldn't have done. Rather, Dodd showed, in John's Gospel we have an independent tradition of material from Southern Palestine. We can't dismiss what John says about the Resurrection.<br><br>So now when C.H.Dodd comes to look at the narratives in John about, for example, the Resurrection and in particular Peter and John's visit to the tomb on the first Easter morning, he sees evidence of eyewitness rather than fabrication. He sees John as an eyewitness in the account of the two Apostles getting to the tomb and seeing "the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen" (John 20.6-7).<br><br>The body of Jesus had been wrapped in long strips of cloth and spices had been put in between. The "burial cloth" was a separate piece of linen wrapped over the head and under the chin to keep the jaw in place. What John's Gospel says is that when John saw these "cloths" he believed. He believed, that is to say, not when he saw the empty tomb, but when he saw the "burial cloth" still separate from the rest of the linen wrappings that had been round the trunk and legs; it seems as though the body had passed through the linen cloths. This was no resuscitation. It was a resurrection! The body had not revived; it had disappeared. "The story," says Dodd, "is told with dramatic realism of which this writer is master. It looks something as near first-hand evidence as we could hope to get. Perhaps it is, and if so, it becomes the sheet anchor of belief in a 'bodily resurrection'."<br><br>It was Dorothy Sayers, who was quite convinced of the "eyewitness" nature of John's Gospel. Looking at the Gospel as a novelist herself and so from the viewpoint of someone used to "creating" or "fabricating stories", she says this: "It must be remembered that, of the four Evangelists, St John's is the only one that claims to be the direct report of an eyewitness. And to anyone accustomed to the imaginative handling of documents, the internal evidence bears out the claim."<br><br><br><b>Luke's Gospel</b><br><br>But John is not the only Gospel writer who tells us what he is aiming to do as he selects his material. Luke also tells us of his aims:</p>

<blockquote><div> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account" (Luke 1.1-3).</div></blockquote>

<p>Despite attempts to discredit Luke over the years, it is quite remarkable how he has withstood the test. Indeed what is noticeable is how modern experts who approach the New Testament from the view point of secular ancient history find Luke convincing. Those used to evaluating ancient documents and sources from the classical world of Greece and Rome say Luke is a good historian. A.N.Sherwin-White, a Roman Historian, was amazed at the scepticism of some New Testament critics. Having examined the New Testament, especially Luke and Acts, from the view point of Roman law and culture, he found it remarkably reliable.<br><br>One of the reasons why Luke has been "attacked" is because he has an interest in the miraculous. This is undeniable. But G.B.Caird, an Oxford New Testament scholar, has written this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Sober criticism cannot get behind the gospel record to a plain, common place tale, devoid of the miraculous and the supernatural. The early Christians believed that, in Christ, God had been at work in new and astonishing ways and they had the evidence of their own eyes to support their faith. Luke cannot justly be accused of exaggerating the miraculous element in his narrative. He omits Mark's most difficult miracle, the story of the barren fig tree. It is true that he also goes one step beyond Mark in recording a cure performed at a distance by the word of command; but this story, the healing of the centurion's servant, was taken from Q [a hypothetical collection of sayings of Jesus], his most trustworthy source. He has sometimes been taken to task for emphasising the physical nature of the Resurrection since it is in his Gospel alone that the risen Jesus eats and drinks with his disciples. But here too he is simply reproducing with fidelity the sources on which he is relying. For in Acts 10.37-43 he puts into the mouth of Peter an almost credal utterance which is clearly derived from an Aramaic source and which represents the same picture of the Resurrection as we find in the Gospel.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>How accurate is accurate? </b><br><br>But how accurate are the four Gospels? For example, did Jesus ever actually say, "I am the Resurrection and the life" as is reported in John's Gospel? R.P.C.Hanson, a bishop, who also was a professor of Theology, once suggested it was an incredible thing to believe that Jesus actually said such words. But is there not confusion here?<br><br>Of course, few would believe that Jesus actually uttered the syllables "I am the Resurrection and the life". Most know that Jesus spoke neither in English nor always in the Greek of John's Gospel but often in Aramaic. But what many, including experts, would want to say is that Jesus said something somewhere in Palestine which through the agency of tradition and translation has come down to us in English as "I am the Resurrection and the life." And we will not be misled if we take this as the gist of what he taught.<br><br>We need to understand the nature of New Testament reporting. It followed its own conventions. The Gospel writers saw no problem in "paraphrasing" or giving the "gist" of someone's speech and then putting it as direct speech. They would have put this between inverted commas if they'd been invented as we now do; but there were none in the original. R.T.France, formerly Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, comments: "The use of inverted commas in [our] translations of the Gospels may lead us to expect, on the basis of our own conventions in reporting speech, a degree of verbatim accuracy which the writer did not intend. So many of the sayings which the Gospels introduce with 'Jesus said' may in fact be paraphrases. But that does not mean they are inventions." Someone once said the Evangelists are intending "to report accurately the substance of Jesus' teaching in meaningful terms to their readers, not to record his precise words in every instance." It is, however, accurate enough. And Jesus himself, of course, promised that the Holy Spirit would enable his disciples to remember what he had taught (John 14.26). So that is why today at the beginning of the 21st century we can, and must, trust these apostolic reports from the Gospel writers.<br><br><br><b>The Christmas message</b><br><br>And that is why you have to take seriously the readings you will hear, once again, this Christmas. John's Gospel goes back to Jesus himself. Luke is particularly concerned with facts - and was a doctor. That probably explains his concern with gynaecology and his interest in the birth of Jesus. <br><br>But what about Matthew? Some try to dismiss Matthew's account of the birth story of Jesus as a midrash. In Judaism a midrash was essentially a commentary on a passage of the Old Testament which then "took off". The midrashist had a text in front of him which he elaborated and embellished, often in a most fanciful way. But the text was always the starting point. Matthew, however, is clearly not starting with a text. He has a series of traditions about the birth and childhood of Jesus to narrate, and into these he weaves scriptural references. He is not adapting the narratives to fit Old Testament texts. If anything he is adapting the Old Testament to fit the narratives. The quotation in Matthew 2.23 ("he shall be called a Nazarene") is a very drastic adaptation - it has no known reference in earlier Scripture!<br><br>Matthew is not, therefore, taking the Old Testament and then writing myths to fit. If he were doing that, he surely would have chosen more evocative sections of the Old Testament. In addition we know from other contemporary Jewish practice that basic events were never concocted out of texts. Most significant of all, the Old Testament said that the Messiah would be born of David's line. The New Testament makes it clear that Jesus was believed to be the Messiah, Why then invent a story that separates Joseph (who was of David's line) from the process of conception? <br><br>The New Testament tells us that at the first Christmas God became man - "the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1.14) - to live, to die for our sins and to rise again to give us new life and his Holy Spirit. That is why we celebrate. We can do so with confidence. <br><br>(Some of this Coloured Supplement is an edited and adapted version of chapter 5 of David Holloway's book Where did Jesus Go?)<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="'Maintain and Proclaim"">(January 2004) "Maintain and Proclaim"</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2004</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>On the second Sunday of January we remember that Jesmond Parish Church was founded in 1861 after the death and in memory of Richard Clayton, the great evangelical leader in Newcastle and former Master of St Thomas', Haymarket. The church authorities had refused to appoint as his successor a man who would be faithful to the Bible as Clayton was. So leading members of the congregation formed a committee and resolved to plant a church which "will form a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth in a large and populous town." <br><br>There was, however, opposition. The new church was nicknamed "St Spite's". Sadly, there is opposition today to the work of JPC, as we still seek to maintain and promulgate "sound scriptural and evangelical truth".<br><br><br><b>The Foundation of JPC</b><br><br>I thank God for the vision of our founders for three reasons.<br><br><i>First</i>, they sought a fundamental balance in wanting not only to maintain but also to promulgate the truth. In Paul's famous last charge to Timothy he makes it clear that the Christian, and certainly the Christian leader, has both to defend but also to evangelize and spread "the Word":</p>

<blockquote><div>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage - with great patience and careful instruction" (2 Timothy 4.2).</div></blockquote>

<p>There is the need both to refute what is wrong but also to encourage and promote - or "preach" - what is right. Sadly, it is all too easy to lose that balance. If you never fight for or maintain "sound Scriptural and evangelical truth", you will soon find you have no gospel to proclaim or promulgate. If you only fight for the truth and never proclaim it, you can become "sound" but dead or "sound" but loveless. It was as Jesus was preaching, teaching and healing in the towns and villages of Galilee, that "when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" (Matthew 9.36). And as he was evangelizing he saw the need for faithful shepherds, not "false prophets [who] come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves" (Matthew 7.15). Maintaining and proclaiming must go together.<br><br><i>Secondly</i>, the founders of JPC realized that truth is objective and definable. They wanted scriptural and evangelical truth. They wanted the truth of the Bible or the scriptures - "God's Word written". That is the truth to which the whole Church has to be subordinate. Nor may the Church "ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another" (Article XX of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England). "Evangelical" truth is this biblical truth that our earlier Anglican fore-fathers stood for at the Reformation, and is summarized in the Thirty-nine Articles. It is this truth the founders of JPC were following.<br><br><i>Thirdly</i>, our founders had a "big vision". They had a vision for the whole city (then a "town" without a charter), which even in 1861 was a "large and populous" place. So our calling in 2004 is to have a vision for continuing to be a "central point" for the gospel on Tyneside.<br><br>What actually does this mean for us at the beginning of the 21st century? A number of us have been asking that question in some detail. There are, of course, some "non-negotiables" - such as this vision of our founders and some of the non-negotiables that come up in our C.L.A.S.S sessions (the Christian Life and Service Seminars). It seemed right, however, that at the start of the new century we should engage in a "Strategic Planning Process". In practice that has meant the senior pastoral staff asking some basic questions and trying to come up with some basic answers. Then that thinking has been and is being shared with others in the leadership of the church for their reaction and input. Finally, when there is sufficient coherence and consensus as to the right way forward, the various departments in the church will be asked to come up with their own "plans" in the light of the overall plan, probably next autumn.<br><br><br><b>Strategic Planning</b><br><br>Of course, all our planning must be provisional. "[We] ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that'" (James 4.15). And we need prayer: "to man belong the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the reply of the tongue" (Proverbs 16.1). It is easy to have good ideas; but to articulate those in a way that communicates and motivates is something God alone can enable. However, there is a promise: "commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed" (Proverbs 16.3). And God can overrule foolish plans: "in his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps" (Proverbs 16.9). That comes out as the English proverb, "man proposes, God disposes".<br><br>On that basis, last September after the senior pastoral staff had made a beginning, they shared their thinking with many of the leaders in the church at Beamish Hall. What then are the basic questions that we, the senior pastoral staff, have set ourselves? There are nine:</p>

<blockquote><div>1. What kind of church are we?2. Why do we do what we do?3. What are we supposed to be doing? What is our mission in life as a church?4. What is going on in the wider world?5. What kind of church would we like to be?6. How will we get to where we want to be? Who will we reach? How will we reach them? Who will reach them? How much will it cost to reach them? Where will we reach them?7. Where do we begin, when and with whom?8. How will we handle pleasant and not so pleasant surprises that could affect the strategy?9. How do we test what we are and will be doing?</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Our Mission</b><br><br>At Beamish I shared our thinking on our values and mission (questions two and three). With regard to our mission we saw no reason to change what has been our mission statement for many years - "Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain [or if you are an international member of JPC, changing your own country]. <br><br>Godly Living relates to the first part of the Great Commandment. "Jesus replied, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart ... soul ... and mind. This is the first and greatest commandment" (Matthew 22.37-38). Godly Living covers personal religion (prayer, bible reading, fellowship and witness (at home and abroad); accepting the importance of baptism and the Lord's supper; belonging through small groups; biblical finance; Christian reading; and care for the poor - at home and abroad. <br><br>Church Growth relates to the Great Commission. "Jesus said ... 'go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you'" (Matthew 28.19-20). Church Growth covers targeted evangelism; expository preaching; strategic youth work; strategic work with students - both UK students and international students; learning from and helping other churches; pastoral care; the welcome and incorporation of newcomers; the music ministry; overseas mission; C.L.A.S.S.; and the use of the public media.<br><br>Changing Britain relates to the second part of the Great Commandment. "And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments" (Matthew 22.39-40). Changing Britain covers influencing education; influencing the media; influencing politics; influencing the therapeutic services; influencing commerce; and re-evangelizing the nation.<br><br><br><b>Our Vision</b><br><br>Jonathan Pryke then reported at Beamish on our thinking about the future. We wondered where we might be (with all the biblical provisos) in twenty years time. When asked where we might be in 2003 in numerical terms, the most common projection from the 100 or so leaders present at Beamish was that we should plan for being 10,000 strong - with 5000 at the central church and 5000 in new church plants. Not until this figure had been reached was it announced that it was the figure the senior pastoral staff had also come up with.<br><br>The significance of this exercise relates to immediate planning. For to reach that target in 2023, in four years time (in 2008) we would need to have Sunday attendance around 1500. But as we are now not far off 1100 on a Sunday, 1500 in 2008 is not at all unlikely. In reality, that means more in all the groups across the age ranges and with all the challenges - hence the wisdom of planning. We planned for more at Carols by Candlelight before Christmas (2003). Through adding two services on the Sunday evenings we "proposed" or planned by increasing our capacity by 33 percent. God honoured that planning. He "disposed" by drawing 31 percent more to our services than in December 2002. Total attendance at Carols by Candlelight in 2003 was 5,100. Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Present Sacrifices, Present Rewards and Future Hope">(February 2004) Present Sacrifices, Present Rewards and Future Hope</h2><ul><li>February 2004</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>[To help with our thinking generally at this time of the Giving Review, I have produced another edited and slightly modernized piece from the "Expository Thoughts" of J. C. Ryle. The Victorian first Bishop of Liverpool is always challenging on the subject of money and this life in the context of eternity. His own wealthy father was bankrupted when Ryle was in his twenties. This had a profound effect on his own thinking and the course of his subsequent work. The following is Ryle on Mark's Gospel chapter 10. 28-34 (I am quoting the NIV version) - David Holloway]</i></p>

<blockquote><div>28 Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!" 29 "I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel 30 will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields - and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first." 32 They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. 33 "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, 34 who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.</div></blockquote>

<p> The first thing which demands our attention in these verses is ...<br><br><br><b>The glorious promise which they contain. </b><br><br>The Lord Jesus says to his Apostles, "I tell you the truth, no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields - and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life."<br><br>There are few wider promises than this is the Word of God. There is none certainly in the New Testament which holds out such encouragement for the present life. Let every one who is fearful and faint-hearted in Christ's service look at this promise. Let all who are enduring hardness and suffering for Christ's sake study this promise well and take comfort from it.<br><br>To all who make sacrifices on account of the Gospel, Jesus promises "a hundred times as much in this present age". They will have not only pardon and glory in the world to come; they will have even here on earth hopes and joys and practical comforts sufficient to make up for all that they lose. They will find in the fellowship of Christians new friends, new relations, new companions that are more loving, faithful and valuable than any they had before their conversion. Their introduction into the family of God will be a full compensation for exclusion from the society of this world. This may sound startling and incredible to many ears. But thousands have found by experience that it is true.<br><br>To all who make sacrifices on account of the Gospel, Jesus promises "in the age to come eternal life". As soon as they put off their earthly body, they will enter upon a glorious existence and in the morning of the resurrection will receive such honour and joy as pass human understanding. Their light affliction for a few years will end in an everlasting reward. Their fights and sorrows while in the body will be exchanged for perfect rest and a conqueror's crown. They will dwell in a world where there is no death, no sin, no devil, no cares, no weeping, no parting; for the former things will have passed away. God has said it, and it will all be found true.<br><br>Where is the Christian who will dare to say in the face of these glorious promises that there is no encouragement to serve Christ? Where is the man or woman whose hands are beginning to hang down and whose knees are beginning to weaken in the Christian race? Let all such meditate on this passage and take fresh courage. The time is short. The end is sure. Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. Let us wait patiently on the Lord.<br><br>The second thing which demands our attention in these verses is ...<br><br><br><b>The solemn warning which they contain.</b><br><br>The Lord Jesus saw the secret pride of his Apostles. He gives them a timely word to check their proud thoughts. "Many who are first will be last, and the last first."<br><br>How true these words were when applied to the twelve Apostles! There was among those who heard our Lord speak a man who at one time seemed likely to be one of the foremost of the twelve. He was one who appeared more careful and trustworthy than any. He was in charge of the [money] bag and controlled what was put in it. And yet that man fell away and came to a disgraceful end. His name was Judas Iscariot. <br><br>However, there was absent from our Lord's hearers that day one who at a later period did more for Christ than any of the twelve. At the time when our Lord spoke he was a young Pharisee, brought up at the feet of Gamaliel and zealous for nothing so much as the Jewish Law. And yet that young man in the end was converted to faith in Christ, was not inferior to any of the Apostles and laboured more fully than all. His name was Saul [then, Paul]. Well might our Lord say, "Many who are first will be last, and the last first."<br><br>How true these words were when we apply them to the history of the Christian Churches! <br><br>There was a time when Asia Minor and Greece and Northern Africa, were full of professing Christians, while England and America were heathen lands. Sixteen hundred years have made a mighty change [Ryle was writing in the 19th century DRJH]. The Churches of Africa and Asia have fallen into complete decay. The English and American Churches are labouring to spread the Gospel over the world. [Now in the 21st century there is another 'mighty change'; other parts of Africa and Asia are seeing the growth of the church, with the Western Churches seeing decline - DRJH.] Well might our Lord say, "the first will be last, and the last first."<br><br>How true these words appear to believers when they look back over their own lives and remember all they have seen from the time of their own conversion! How many others began to serve Christ at the same time as themselves and seemed to run well for a season. But where are they now? The world has got hold of one. False doctrine has beguiled another. A mistake in marriage has spoiled a third. Few indeed are the believers who cannot call to mind many such cases. Few have failed to discover by sad experience that "the last are often first, and the first last."<br><br>Let us learn to pray for humility when we read texts like this. It is not enough to begin well. We must persevere and go on and continue in well-doing. We must not be content with the fair flowers of a few religious convictions and joys and sorrows and hopes and fears. We must bear the good fruit of settled habits of repentance, faith and holiness. Happy is the one who counts the cost and resolves, having once begun to walk in the narrow way, by God's grace never to turn aside.<br><br>The last thing that demands our attention in this passage is ...<br><br><br><b>Our Lord's clear foreknowledge of his own sufferings and death. </b><br><br>Calmly and deliberately he tells his disciples of his coming passion at Jerusalem. One after another he describes all the leading circumstances which would accompany his death. Nothing is reserved. Nothing is kept back.<br><br>Let us mark this well. There was nothing involuntary and unforeseen in our Lord's death. It was the result of his own free, determined and deliberate choice. From the beginning of his earthly ministry he saw the cross before him and went to it a willing sufferer. He knew that his death was the payment needed that must be made to reconcile God and man. That payment he had covenanted and promised to make at the price of his own blood. And so, when the appointed time came, like a true guarantee, he kept his word and died for our sins on Calvary.<br><br>Let us always praise God that the Gospel sets before us such a Saviour, so faithful to the terms of the covenant, so ready to suffer, so willing to be reckoned sin and a curse in our place. Let us not doubt that he who fulfilled his promise to suffer will also fulfil his promise to save all who come to him. Let us not only accept him gladly as our Redeemer and Advocate, but gladly give ourselves, and all we have, to his service. Surely, if Jesus cheerfully died for us, it is a small thing to require Christians to live for him.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Passion of the Christ">(March 2004) The Passion of the Christ</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2004</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>At the end of February the media carried a number of comments on Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Christ.<br><br><br><b>British commentators</b><br><br>On 27 February BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day had an Anglican clergyman telling us that: <i>"There may have been better films about Jesus of Nazareth ... but it's hard to think of one that has caused more public uproar ... To the earlier charge of anti-Semitism (hotly refuted by Gibson, of course) there has now been added the accusation of gratuitous violence in portraying the crucifixion of Jesus." </i><br><br>The speaker, in effect, damned the film although he confessed: "I have only seen extracts of the film, but I have talked to people who have seen the whole production and read what has been written about it." But how responsible is it to make judgments on a film you have not seen?<br><br>The same day Geza Vermes, the Jewish scholar who used to teach at Newcastle, then at Oxford, was writing in The Guardian. His piece was headed, "Mel Gibson's film about Christ is horribly gory, historically wrong - and it will inspire judeophobia". He writes that the film is "two hours of almost uninterrupted gratuitous brutality" and "I hope I will never be obliged to see something as dreadful again." <br><br>So what do we say to Vermes? First, that Mel Gibson's production is not way off a common sense reading of the New Testament. Secondly, the film makes it quite clear that there were some wonderful Jews - the followers of Jesus - and not least the women who were there at the end. Thirdly, Vermes does not regard the Gospels as reliable witnesses. But many would disagree and argue that the film is not "historically wrong" because the Gospels are good witnesses.<br><br>A similar position was taken by Andreas Whittam Smith, formerly head of the British Board of Film Classification and now head of the Church Commissioners. In the Independent on 1 March he faults the film for not being for outsiders but for "practising Christians. Look, it seems to be saying to them, your familiarity with the story of Christ's passion as a result of its constant repetition has gradually drained away the meaning from the original events. This film shows you what it really must have been like." The problem, however, is that "the narrative takes no account of corrections which scholars have made to the New Testament account in the light of the known history." So the New Testament, he too is saying, has got it wrong.<br><br><br><b>Michael Medved</b><br><br>Such comments did not surprise me. Over the months that The Passion of the Christ was being filmed, there were many critical reports including the charge that it would be a box-office flop. However, Michael Medved, the distinguished American film-critic and author of the best-selling 1992 book Hollywood vs. America, took a more positive view. His opinion is important, not only because of his inside knowledge of Hollywood but also because he himself is a Jew. So what does he say? <br><br>First, he denies the film is anti-Semitic. Then he says:</p>

<blockquote><div>The truth of it is, that anybody who has ever sat down and read the four Gospels understands that the real complaint here is not against 'St Mel', it's against St Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. And the parts of the movie that seem to bother some people most are directly from the Gospel account.</div></blockquote>

<p> Then with regard to the artistic merits of the film and its chance of "making it" in Hollywood, Medved comments:</p>

<blockquote><div>It's going to be a tremendous hit because people who believe in the Gospels, people who care about the Gospels, are going to embrace it, but so also are secular critics. I was struck by the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper [two important secular critics] have given this film the highest praise. It deserves it. It is, by a wide margin of advantage, the most artistically satisfying treatment of a Biblical story that has ever been put on film. And I think it's going to change people's lives.</div></blockquote>

<p> With all this in my mind I went to the first of the regional British previews for church leaders on Monday 1 March. This was held in Newcastle. After watching the film I asked myself four questions.<br><br><br><b>Violence</b><br><br><i>One</i>, did I think the film should not have been made? Answer: No! I know nothing about Mel Gibson apart from what I have read. I do not know his deepest motives in making this film. But as Paul said in Philippians 1.18: "But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this, I rejoice." It follows, therefore, that some people, at least, should see it. The film contains incidents in Jesus' life; it begins with a quotation from Isaiah 53 on screen; and it includes, sympathetically, Jesus uttering his words recorded in John 14.6:</p>

<blockquote><div>I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." </div></blockquote>

<p> If that is going to be seen around the world, as many as possible should see it.<br><br><i>Two</i>, what did I think about the violence in the film? Answer: It was terrible. But crucifixion is terrible. Too many Christians have an anodyne view of the Cross. It is a Cross with antiseptic all over it. But the first readers of the New Testament had a totally different consciousness when they heard that great credal assertion of Paul "that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures" (1 Cor 15.3). They had in mind the reality of Gibson's passion, not some silver cross worn on a necklace.<br><br>The Roman writer Cicero said that crucifixion was "a most cruel and disgusting punishment." He later said:</p>

<blockquote><div>to bind a Roman citizen is a crime; to flog him is an abomination; to kill him is almost an act of murder; to crucify him is - what? - there is no fitting word that can possibly describe so horrible a deed.</div></blockquote>

<p> The early readers of the New Testament were all too familiar with this dreadful form of execution. So the early Christians then saw the measure of God's love in "that Christ died for our sins" on a cross. They saw that also as the measure of the seriousness of all sin - the sin of the religious establishment that secured Jesus' death, the sin of the brutal Romans that performed the crucifixion, and the sin of Peter who denied Jesus. So today we, too, should see that as the measure of the seriousness of our sin.<br><br>It was quite moving to discover that Gibson chose to illustrate the truth that "all have sinned" within the film itself. In the scene where Jesus' hands are nailed to the cross, the hands of the unseen soldier hammering the nails are Gibson's own hands. <br><br><br><b>Think carefully</b><br><br><i>Three</i>, who should go to see it? Answer: If you are a Christian who meditates disproportionately on the sufferings of Jesus in an obsessive way, you shouldn't go. I am sure some people do that in some traditions of Christianity. But my view is that modern Western Protestants do not have that temptation. Rather we have a temptation to sing hymns and choruses that focus on Christ's death and to attend Holy Communion with too little concern for the awful cost of that death. To be reminded of what 1st century Christians knew only too well, provides a good commentary on the Bible. Do not believe Mel Gibson. Believe the text of the New Testament. Go back to the Bible after seeing the film. It will, I believe, come more alive. And, of course, only people of 18 plus can see the film. All will be moved by the film but, it needs to be said, some of us could find the brutality of the soldiers very distressing.<br><br><i>Four</i>, what criticisms did I have? Answer: I thought the scourging scene was too long. It was not gratuitously violent, but it was terrible. The violence of the soldiers seemed all the more terrible because Christ is so sensitively portrayed as good and noble. This highlights the contrast between his goodness and the their evil. It is worth mentioning that there is no "sex" in this film at all, unlike The Last Temptation of Christ, which I judged a blasphemous film. And I am sure the film could have been improved in other ways. But speaking personally I was infinitely more gripped (and moved and challenged) by The Passion of the Christ than by The Lord of the Rings.<br><br>Of course, no merely human production (on screen, in print or from a pulpit) is ever perfect. That is why all has to be checked against "God's Word written" - the Bible. But remember D.L.Moody, the great American Evangelist. There was a quote he loved to use as he travelled around on his evangelistic campaigns. Very often he was criticized for errors he was making in his grammar and style of preaching. The evangelist would listen to the criticism and then reply: <i>"I like my way of doing things rather than your way of not doing them."</i><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Lord Carey, Islam, The West and Christianity">(April 2004) Lord Carey, Islam, The West and Christianity</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2004</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>On 25 March 2004 [Lord] George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, gave an important address at the Gregorian University in Rome, entitled "Christianity and Islam: Collision or convergence?". In this he said: "a fight for the soul of Islam is going on. Why is it now associated with violence and terrorism?" Muslim reaction was hostile. When interviewed the following day on the BBC Dr Carey said that his remarks had been taken out of context. So what had he actually been saying? He asked four questions.<br><br><br><strong>Islam, terrorism and death</strong><br><br>The first was "what are the reasons for Islam's association with terrorism and death?" He answered historically, pointing out that from the 18th to 20th centuries Muslims failed to engage with the Industrial Revolution. This meant that by the middle of the 20th century many Westerners considered Islam "a backward looking faith associated with backward societies." Then came the 1967 Six Days War when Syria, Egypt and Jordan after mounting a  surprise attack against Israel not only were defeated but lost vast tracts of Arab land, for example, Sinai, Gaza and the Golan Heights. Serious questioning followed.</p>

<blockquote><div>Many concluded that a return to the simplicity of the Islamic faith and wholehearted adherence to the Koran was necessary. To follow the West and to emulate its ways seemed to be the road to decadence and moral decline. From this period on reform and renewal movements begin to appear in Islam which in spite of different emphases have one common aim, that is, to restore greatness to Islam. Despising the political passivity of conservative Islam on the one hand, and the eagerness of modernist Muslims to embrace aspects of secularism on the other, radical movements are one in their desire to re-Islamize Muslim societies and fight the encroaching secularism and materialism that they see coming from the West.</div></blockquote>

<p>The next critical year was 1979. That was when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. "Muslims world-wide," said Dr Carey, "were outraged. As one Muslim friend put it to me, 'Russians were not merely infidels, they were worse - they were unbelieving infidels!'" This resulted in a jihad being called with mujahidin (warriors) fighting a war to the death. It also resulted in the emergence of a new young leader in Afghanistan, a Saudi influenced by the Saudi Wahhabi movement (a Muslim "Puritan" movement), who was able to use his wealth, supplemented by US aid and ammunition, to undermine the Russian invasion. His name was Osama bin Laden! Also that year (1979) Shiites overturned the secular regime in Iran to form the Iranian Islamic Republic. Ten years later there was a coup in the Sudan, when Col. Omar al-Bashir took over control, assisted by Hassan al-Turabi, a sophisticated Western education lawyer and intellectual. Al-Turabi had, said Dr Carey, "a clear and unambiguous vision to impose Islam on the whole world and make Sharia law mandatory - an imposition achieved, more or less in the Sudan." Five years later, in 1994 "a group of students living on the borders of Pakistan, called the Taliban, took control of Afghanistan claiming moral leadership and imposing an ultra-conservative form of Wahhabism." Then ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... in the year 2000, Osama bin Laden, now alienated from America and the West, announced the formation of a World Islamic Front for a jihad against Americans and Crusaders (a euphemism for Christians) ... On Sept 11th 2001 the World Islamic Front struck through dedicated young men who were prepared to die with the Koran at their side shouting 'Allah is great!' guiding huge planes to destroy the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. With them died many hundreds of others.</div></blockquote>

<p>Dr Carey concluded his catalogue of acts of jihad by listing the violent attack on a Chinese and Christian village in Indonesia a few days after "911" by 120 Muslim troops again "shouting 'Allah is great!'"; the killing of hundreds in Bali, Indonesia, a year later; and finally the "awful episode" in Madrid last month (March 2004).<br><br><br><strong>The challenges to Islam, the West and Christianity</strong><br><br>His second question was "what challenges does Islam itself face?" Dr Carey quoted the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mohammed Mahathir, who said: "I find it very hard to be optimistic about Muslims in the 21st century. Very few Muslims understand reality and they do not understand  that coming to terms with globalization is one of the greatest challenges facing them." He then quoted former President Wahid of Indonesia who  said: "The Muslim world is at a cross-roads. It may pursue a traditional static Islam or refashion it into a more dynamic and pluralistic world-view."<br><br>George Carey's solution is, first, "for Muslim societies to integrate their faith and practice in democratic institutions." Secondly, there needs to be social improvement: "giving power to the people in democratic governance is not sufficient if economic stability, universal education and human rights are not available and accessible." Thirdly, there needs to be a liberalization of theological Islam. And, fourthly, moderate Muslims are "to resist strongly the taking over of Islam by radical activists and to express strongly, on behalf of the many millions of their co-religionists, their abhorrence of violence done in the name of Allah ... Sadly, apart from a few courageous examples, very few Muslim leaders condemn, clearly and unconditionally, the evil of suicide bombers who kill innocent people."<br><br>The third question was, "what then is the challenge to the West in general and to Christians in particular?" President Khatami of Iran has said: "today's world democracies are suffering from a major vacuum which is the vacuum of spirituality." In response Dr Carey admitted that "greed. exploitation and corruption lurk in our advanced societies and shame our claim to conduct our communities in moral and wise ways. The degree of crime and delinquency, going hand in hand with a decline in moral   standards and the collapse of such institutions as marriage and the family, are reasons why the West must be reticent in claiming the high moral ground." However, we should "strengthen western values, founded as undoubtedly the are  on the Christian moral tradition and culture." He then said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>In spite of our shortcomings at least European and American civilisations are repositories of fairness and liberal values. Democracy, as an element  of these, is a beautiful and fragile flower and we should support it, valueit and protect it. It allows for dissent, for freedom of expression and for rights for all. We should not give in to claims that Islamic countries are morally, spiritually and culturally superior to other civilizations and great cultures ... the West has still much to be proud of and we should say so strongly.</div></blockquote>

<p>So how should Christians relate to Muslims? Dr Carey says there is much to admire in Muslims, including "their commitment to traditional values,    the family, children and peace."<br><br>He then went on to say:</p>

<blockquote><div>they have no respect for Christians who take the view that all religions are the same. They know they are not. They will always respect people who stand up for their faith and are prepared to talk about it naturally. Christians need to be more confident and argue their corner for reciprocity throughout the world. During my time as Archbishop this was my constant refrain - that the welcome we have given to Muslims in the West with the accompanying freedom to worship freely and build their mosques should be reciprocated in Muslims lands. However, that freedom is uneven. In some Muslim lands there are strong cordial relationships but in some others Christians have little freedom, are sometimes persecuted, are not able to build their churches, or only do so after much difficulty. Saudi Arabia will not allow Christian worship and Christian priests and ministers are not allowed to function as such in that land. Muslim leaders often tell Christians and Jews that 'there is no compulsion in religion'. This sadly is only half true. If non-Muslims are not compelled to become Muslim, Muslims are not free to choose another faith. There is, we find, some compulsion after all.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><strong>Collision, convergence and sexual immorality</strong><br><br>So the fourth question is: "how may we move from collision to convergence in mutual understanding and respect?" Dr Carey is optimistic if there is, first, more "inter-faith co-operation and understanding" and a focusing "on root causes of unrest where religions clash" (the two causes he cites are social injustice and the problem of Israel). But, secondly, we must win "the battle of ideas" while stressing what we have in common with Islam. So he concludes:</p>

<blockquote><div>let us look forward to the day when we shall not talk about faiths         colliding, but Islam and Christianity converging in a common desire to create a world of tolerance and peace and building communities on those shared values that make us human and capable of giving and receiving God's give of love.</div></blockquote>

<p>We must be grateful to George Carey for putting the debate regarding Islam onto the public agenda. My summary is just one quarter as long as the original address, but I have tried to be fair (you can download the whole text from <a href="http://bradford.anglican.org/newsbyte/040326carey.html.">http://bradford.anglican.org/newsbyte/040326carey.html.</a> There are, indeed, vital issues at stake.<br><br>The issues at stake relate to the twin issues of violence and immorality; the nature of western liberal democracy that Muslims are now being asked to adopt; and the relationship of religion and government, or church and state.<br><br>George Carey has majored on violence in Islam. Nothing of what he has said can be refuted. There is, in some parts of extremist Islam, an evil terrorist agenda. I believe his historical analysis is generally correct. But I can imagine a senior Muslim cleric, who is trying genuinely to be fair and "liberal",  reading Dr Carey's address, but then appealing to the principle of reciprocity. He might say something like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>I admit what you say about violence. But let me talk about immorality - sexual immorality and sexual immorality in the West and in the western churches. You ask for plain speaking. Let me give you some. We are appalled at bishops in the western Anglican churches who support immorality. We are appalled at the recent consecration as a bishop in the USA of Gene Robinson, a man who has left his wife and children for his male lover. We are appalled at the Bishops of Worcester, Newcastle and Manchester recently voting in the House of Lords to stop clergy and churches having freedom regarding transsexuals. You say that, 'sadly, apart from a few courageous examples, very few Muslim leaders condemn, clearly and unconditionally, the evil of suicide bombers.' But we say to you, sadly, apart from a few courageous examples, very few Christian leaders (and those leaders are rarely bishops in the Church of England) condemn, clearly and unconditionally, the evil of sexual immorality  that destroys lifelong marriage and family life, ruins the life chances of children (as social scientists are now proving), and leads to disease and death. We note that the number of people who have died from AIDS is far in excess of the numbers who were killed at the Twin Towers or through suicide bombers or through those terrorist acts you catalogued. You speak about "root causes". We have to be honest. We see the root cause of the AIDS epidemic as sexual immorality; and we see liberal Christianity as validating this immorality. Please understand that we treat immorality like you treat violence.</div></blockquote>

<p>What would the former Archbishop of Canterbury say to that? We know that he advocates, as a solution to the problem of violence, western liberal democracy. But how will that solve the problem of sexual immorality? And what is western liberalism that is at the heart of western democracy?<br><br><br><strong>Western liberal democracy</strong><br><br>Dr Carey may not adequately recognize that there is not just "a fight for the soul of Islam". There is also a fight for the soul of the West. There is a critical conflict between those wanting the traditional Western liberal tradition and those wanting a new revised liberalism.<br><br>The traditional Western liberal tradition has accepted the dominance of the Christian or Judaeo-Christian world view, but has been tolerant of those  with other beliefs or philosophies except where those views promote violence  or sexual immorality. John Locke, the philosopher, was the god-father of this tradition with his famous Letter Concerning Toleration of 1689. In this letter he argued that belief cannot be forced by the power of the state. The "wars of religion" had assumed that the state, through such acts as "burning at the stake", could enforce religious conformity. This was now seen to be wrong. And so the age of "toleration" was born, with the Toleration Act of 1689 and John Locke's letter. But toleration is not indifferentism. You can only tolerate what you think is wrong! Nor does toleration mean you must keep silent about your views. Traditional liberalism means freedom of expression. So in 1694 Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act. At a stroke, prepublication censorship came to an end. Macaulay described that as a greater contribution to liberty and civilization than either the Magna Carta or the Bill of Rights. You were now free to say what you like. But this freedom, as with all freedoms, was limited. Publications were still subject to the laws of the land regarding sedition, blasphemy, obscenity and libel. It was ideas that were free, yet they also (including religious ideas) were limited. According to Locke the magistrate must ban a religious group if it "should have a mind to sacrifice infants, or lustfully pollute themselves in promiscuous uncleanness, or practise any other such heinous  enormities." All that is traditional Western liberalism.<br><br>But now there is a new revisionist liberalism. This has been pushed by a minority who have influence and huge power in the media, education, the therapeutic services and government. This new liberalism says that the public square has to be naked. It has no place for any dominant world view. It must be  open to everyone and everything. The fundamental axiom is the necessity of a totally free and open society ("comprehensive" liberalism). This then must lead to constitutional freedoms for all ("political" liberalism).  It sounds so good. But it is a defiance of the basic Western liberal tradition where liberty has always been less than absolute, witness the outlawing of Mormon polygamy. Islam, however, sees this new revisionist liberalism as becoming dominant. and it doesn't like what it sees. It sees that violence is still outlawed; but it sees immorality as now positively validated in the West as an option.<br><br><br><strong>Church and state</strong><br><br>How does the Bible encourage us to think about these things? Certainly there is no place for force in the spread of God's kingdom. By the time of Jesus "holy wars" are forbidden (cf Luke 9.54-55 and Matt 26.51-64). Jesus taught  that God's way of salvation is not by the sword but by his death on the cross. The state alone has the right to use force - that is its essential distinctive. But the state is not the Church. Its primary duty is not to preach the gospel but to keep order. So Jesus said: "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's" (Matt 22.21). This was, and is, so basic.<br><br>Paul fills out the meaning of those words in Romans 13, where "Caesar" (or the State) is shown to be able to use force as "God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer" (verse 4). Paul has explained in the previous chapter that it is not up to the individual to "take revenge". He or she is to "leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord" (Romans 12.19). That wrath - or judgment - will be fully revealed on the judgment day. But in the meantime for the good of society and to restrain the worst effects of fallen human beings, God delegates some of his judicial functions to the state (with a just war being an extension of those judicial functions). But the state must not use force to enforce belief. The fearful doctrine of Hell underlines the importance of human freedom with regard to religious belief. If God give us the freedom to reject him, we must not force people to accept him. So the good government is not one that enforces belief but one where civil order is maintained, so "that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness" (1 Timothy 2.3).<br><br>But the government cannot be neutral. While it will allow freedom for religion, it inevitably will have some dominant value system. You cannot be totally open. To be "open" is itself a positive philosophical position  and a very dangerous one. It pretends to be something it isn't. So, to take education as an example, people think that if a school is to be totally "open" to all beliefs, it will be absolutely neutral. It won't be. It will be subtly indoctrinating the children in the philosophy of secular humanism or "multifaithism". All sorts of nasty things will probably be creeping in. Once you lose the Fatherhood of God, you soon lose the brotherhood of man. Once you cease to hold Jesus Christ as not only the image of God but also the image of true human being - who do you have? Some, no doubt, would choose a fascist dictator!<br><br>The reality is that in the modern world the main options for beliefs or values are Christian, Muslim or secular humanist. To generalize, both Islam and secular humanism do not make the distinction between Caesar and God. Islam ideally would seek to abolish Caesar, which on recent evidence results in a theocratic state with draconian and brutal laws. Secular humanism ideally would seek to abolish God, which on recent evidence results in repressive and brutal totalitarianisms. True freedom comes from following the way of Christ and the Bible's teaching on the Church and state.<br><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>Unless there is a revival of Biblical Christianity in the West resulting in new public moral restraints, the prognosis is not good. So we must win our friends in the West for Jesus Christ - our friends who have bought into  the false religion of secular humanism. But we also must seek to win (peacefully) Muslims to Christ for their sakes and not just for the resulting restraints on terrorism. They, as all of us, desperately need to hear the good news of Christ and the cross. Sadly, people who talk about Islam as an alternative way to God, fail to realize that Islam by-passes the Cross - the heart of the good news. Here is John Stott's summary of the Koran's teaching on the Cross:"The Koran sees no need for the sin-bearing death of a Saviour. At least five times it declares categorically that 'no soul shall bear another's burden'. Indeed, 'if a laden soul cries out for help, not even a near relation shall share its burden'. Why is this? It is because 'each man shall reap the fruits of his own deeds', even though Allah is merciful and forgives those who repent and do good. Denying the need of the cross the Koran goes on to deny the fact. The Jews 'uttered a monstrous falsehood' when they declared 'we have put to death the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, the apostle of Allah,' for 'they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but they thought they did'."</p>

<p>We are not to stand in judgment on individual Muslims nor on secular humanists. When necessary, we have to say, graciously, that we believe they are wrong. But more importantly we are to tell everyone that "Christ died for sins [the sins of terrorism and the sins of sexual immorality] once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God" (1 Peter 3.18). And he is the only way. That is the good news of Good Friday. We are then to tell them that Christ is risen and reigning - the good news of Easter Day.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Appointment of Jeffrey John as Dean of St. Albans">(May 2004) The Appointment of Jeffrey John as Dean of St. Albans</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2004</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>On 19 April 2004 Jeffrey John, the Anglican clergyman who withdrew from his appointment as Bishop of Reading, was officially named as the next Dean of St Albans. Having already been asked my views for the <em>Sunday Telegraph </em>(which were reported the previous day) I was asked to say a few words on BBC Radio 4's <em>The World at One</em> that Monday about the appointment. Also I was interviewed for BBC TV's <em>The Ten O'Clock News</em> that evening. Extracts were then quoted in various newspapers and with various spins. For the record - and to indicate the seriousness of the situation - the following is what actually was said.<br><br><br><b><em>The World at One</em></b><br><br>In his introduction Guto Harri, the interviewer, announced the appointment and said:</p>

<blockquote><div>&gt;"Dr Jeffrey John who is openly gay faced an outcry last year from traditionalists. 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.' Or if you can't get a job as a bishop, why not get a job as a dean. Downing Street has today confirmed that Canon Jeffrey John has been appointed as the next Dean of St. Albans, a very senior position in the Anglican Church. Last year he was forced to stand down as the Bishop of Reading because he is gay. One of Jeffrey John's strongest supporters has been his boss, Colin Slee, the current Dean of Southwark Cathedral.</div></blockquote>

<p>Harri then quizzed Colin Slee who said this was "very good news"; the job offered John "enormous potential"; he was sure "this does have the backing of the Archbishop of Canterbury or it wouldn't have gone ahead;" and "it's an appointment whose authority has Number 10 behind it, but it will be after very, very thorough consultation."<br><br>When asked, "what would you say to those today who feel outraged, who feel very sore, or who perhaps want to leave the Church of England?" Colin Slee replied as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Jeffrey has been appointed after all the proper and agreed due processes of the church and if you are a member of the church, it's important that you accept and conform to those processes.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><strong>The opposing view</strong><br><br>Guto Harri then went on to consider those of us who are deeply worried by what has happened:</p>

<blockquote><div>There are concerns that the appointment of Jeffrey John could re-ignite      tensions between the so-called 'progressive' and the 'conservative' wings of  the Anglican Church. The Rev. David Holloway is the Bishop of Jesmond. In the past he has been a vocal opponent of the appointment. He joins me now on the line.</div></blockquote>

<p>The following is a transcript of the discussion:</p>

<blockquote><div>Harri: "Downing Street has approved it. The Queen has approved it. Are you happy with this appointment?"DH: <em>No! - actually I'm the vicar of Jesmond - I am very unhappy with it. The Church of England by its constitution is, quotes, 'grounded in the Holy Scriptures'. The Bible is crystal clear: sex is for heterosexual monogamous  marriage. This is what the clergy must teach and Jeffrey John publicly does not teach this.</em>Harri: "Do you suspect that Downing Street has had a say in all of this, nudging the Church of England in the direction that people like you do not want it to go?"DH: <em>Obviously Tony Blair has had a say and also the Bishop of St. Albans has had a say in this, as it is also a parish church. I don't know what Tony Blair has in mind. It's certainly in keeping with this government's commitment to pieces of immoral legislation - from endorsing virtual gay marriage to   promoting, or allowing the promotion of, homosexual relationships in schools which happened with the repeal of Clause 28. But the reason why this is so serious is that at the moment we have in this country one of the worst marriage records; and any public endorsement of immorality is an attack on marriage. And then, you know, the break-up of the married family is serious for society. It damages children. On average, they suffer with alternative families and so forth. So we are dealing with a matter of great social importance and the Church is seen, with this appointment, to be institutionalizing (as it were) what I would call decadence.</em>Harri: "Very briefly, is there anything you can do beyond complain?"DH: <em>No! But may I say that where the life and growth is in the Church - in the Church of England and indeed in mainstream Protestantism - is where you have people who teach the Bible.</em>Harri: "David Holloway, there we must leave it, I’m afraid.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b><em>The Ten O'Clock News </em></b><br><br>On BBC ONE's evening television news that day (The Ten O'Clock News) the newsreader announced the appointment and then commented that "Dr. Jeffrey John who is openly gay but celibate, faced an outcry last year from traditionalists within the Church of England. Dr. John's new appointment was approved by the Queen in the past few days, as Annita McVeigh reports" - [the following is a transcript of her report]:</p>

<blockquote><div>A McV: "After the controversy of last summer Jeffrey John had dropped out of the spotlight until now. Today was about new beginnings for the gay Canon whose appointment as Dean of St.Albans has been approved by the Queen. He spoke first about the generosity of the welcome at the cathedral."John [insert]: "It's a very inclusive place, a place with a warm tradition of welcoming everybody whoever they are and whatever label is attached to them and that's something for which obviously I have a special reason to be grateful here today".A McV: "Last year he was at the centre of one of the biggest crises in the history of the Anglican Church over the decision to appoint him as Bishop of Reading. Conservatives warned of a split if the appointment went ahead. For the sake of unity he stepped aside. A short time later the Church's General  Synod ruled out a debate on the issue saying it would generate more heat than light."The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams [insert]: "It's better to have a debate which is more general than personal in its focus. It's better to have a debate when a little time for reflection has elapsed."A McV: "But events are overtaking the reflection, not least gay and lesbian unions in America and the plans for a civil partnerships bill here. Canon John says he will not act against the teachings of the Church but supports Church and State providing frameworks for these partnerships."John [insert]: "I don't much mind whether one calls that a marriage or not, but what matters is that gay people are given that framework for stable, holy living." A McV: "It's too early to assess the full impact the appointment will have on the Church, but some traditionalists have clear opinions on what it means. David Holloway, Jesmond Parish Church in Newcastle ... "DH [insert]: <em>Any public endorsement of immorality which this is, undermines the married family and at the moment in the West, not least in England and Britain, we need to support the married family for the good of society, for the good of individual couples and especially for the good of children.</em>A McV: "Jeffrey John chose his words carefully today, wary of being misinterpreted in this most controversial of debates on sexuality and the church. Nevertheless there are plenty of people who feel this is a provocative development; Annita McVeigh, BBC News, St Albans Cathedral.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>Jeffrey John is a propagandist for the homosexual cause. Like his friend Rowan Williams, he is fluent, genial and clever. But, like his friend, he defies the clear teaching of the Bible. Jesus spoke of "false prophets in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves" (Matt 7.15). Paul spoke of "savage wolves ... even from your own number men will distort the truth" (Acts 20.29-30). Jude spoke of "men who change the grace of God into a licence for immorality" (Jude 4). As were indulgences at the Reformation, so is homosexuality a presenting problem today. As then, huge issues are at stake, not least that of Biblical authority. Do you go to the Bible, to quote Charles Simeon (the Evangelical leader at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries), "to sit as a learner at the feet of the holy Apostles" or "to teach them how they ought to have spoken?" Had Jeffrey John said that a life of greed was compatible with the Christian faith, we would have been just as opposed.<br><br>Jesus was the most compassionate of all. He welcomed prostitutes and other sexual sinners, but also the hated and fraudulent tax collectors. However, Jesus never muted either his sexual ethics or his attacks on greed. He was more strict in sexual matters than his contemporaries - witness his teaching on divorce and remarriage (Mark 10.2-12); but also he was very strict on greed - witness his dealing with the rich young man (Mark 10.17-23). But there was forgiveness for everyone - from the woman caught in adultery (John 8.1-11) to Zacchaeus, the chief tax collector (Luke 19.1-9). That must be our position - compassion and care, but faithfulness to Christ and so firmness where necessary.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Trinity and The Athanasian Creed">(June 2004) The Trinity and The Athanasian Creed</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2004</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p>6 June 2004 is Trinity Sunday. The Trinity is a doctrine beyond the grasp of our finite minds - it is a great mystery. It is the affirmation of a "tri" "unity" in God. It is an affirmation of the fact that God is both three and one.</p><p><br><strong>The Truth of the Trinity</strong></p><p>The old formularies of the Church of England are quite clear about the Trinity. Article I of the <em>Thirty-nine Articles</em> says this: "in unity of [the] Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost [Spirit]." The Trinity is implicit in <em>The Apostles' Creed</em> we say at normal morning and evening services; and even more so in <em>The Nicene Creed</em> we say at Holy Communion services. It is affirmed in the most detailed way, however, in <em>The Athanasian Creed</em>. That creed is seldom said because it is so detailed. Nevertheless as Article VIII of the <em>Thirty-nine Articles</em> says: "The Three Creeds, <em>Nicene</em> Creed, <em>Athanasius'</em> Creed, and that which is commonly called the <em>Apostles'</em> Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture."</p><p>So what does the Bible teach about the Trinity? It certainly teaches "trinitarian" doctrine. Jesus taught that his disciples were to baptise "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." And notice, he said "name" not "names". But the Bible is clear that God is a transcendent God, the almighty God, who passes our finite understanding. Isaiah 55.9 says, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." So at the same time as we affirm the Trinity, it must always be kept in mind that there is so much we do not understand about<br> the nature of God - his eternity, the fact that he is all-knowing, and his providence and sovereign ordering of history and individual life. J.I.Packer puts it like this:</p>
<blockquote><div>how the one eternal God is eternally both singular and plural, how Father, Son and Spirit are personally distinct yet essentially one (so that Tritheism, belief in three gods who are not one, and Unitarianism, belief in one God who is not three, are both wrong), is more than we can know, and any attempt to "explain" it - to dispel the mystery by reasoning, as distinct from confessing it from Scripture - is bound to falsify it. Here, as elsewhere, our God is too big for his creatures' little minds.</div></blockquote>
<p>The truth of the Trinity is confirmed in three ways. First there are the facts of history as we can see them in the Bible. These force us to make a Trinitarian confession. In the bible you see a man who was God, but praying to <em>his</em> Father. Then he promised that he and his Father would send "the Counsellor" - the Holy Spirit to continue the divine ministry. Secondly there is the experience of Christians "worshipping God the Father above you and knowing the fellowship of God the Son beside you, both through the prompting of God the Holy Spirit within you." Thirdly, there is, as we have said, the Bible itself. The Bible teaches that there is a co-operative activity of the Three in our salvation. See Romans 8.1-17; Ephesians 1.3-14; and many other passages including 2 Corinthians 13.14:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>It is, therefore, sad that <em>The Athanasian Creed</em> is often neglected. So, at least, on Trinity Sunday we should remind ourselves of it.</p><p><br><strong>The Athanasian Creed</strong></p><p>What then does the creed say? Here is a modern translation by C.H. Turner and it is based on the revised Latin text:</p>
<blockquote><div>Who ever desires to be saved must above all things hold the Catholic faith. Unless a man keeps it in its entirety inviolate, he will assuredly perish eternally.Now this is the Catholic faith, that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in unity, without confusing the persons or dividing the substance. For the Father's person is one, the Son's another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is one, their glory is equal, their majesty coeternal.Such as the Father is, such is the Son, such also the Holy Spirit. The Father is increate, the Son increate, the Holy Spirit increate. The Father is infinite, the Son infinite, the Holy Spirit infinite. The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal. Yet there are not there eternals, but one eternal; just as there are not three increates or three infinites, but one increate and one infinite. In the same way the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, the Holy Spirit almighty; yet there are not three almighties, but one almighty.Thus the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit God; and yet there are not three Gods, but there is one God. Thus the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet there are not three Lords, but there is one Lord. Because just as we are obliged by Christian truth to acknowledge each person separately both God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the Catholic religion to speak of three Gods or Lords.The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created but begotten. The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this trinity there is nothing before or after, nothing greater or less, but all three persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. Thus in all things, as has been stated above both Trinity in unity and unity in Trinity must be worshipped. So he who desires to be saved should think thus of the Trinity.It is necessary, however, to eternal salvation that he should also faithfully believe in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is equally both God and man.He is God from the Father's substance, begotten before time; and he is man from his mother's substance, born in time. Perfect God, perfect man composed of a rational soul and human flesh, equal to the Father in respect of his divinity, less than the Father in respect of his humanity.Who although he is God and man, is nevertheless not two but one Christ. He is one, however, not by the transformation of his divinity into flesh, but by the taking up of his humanity into God; one certainly not by confusion of substance, but by oneness of person. For just as rational soul and flesh are a single man, so God and man are a single Christ.Who suffered for our salvation, descended to hell, rose from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the Father's right hand, whence he will come to judge living and dead: at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies, and will render an account of their deeds; and those who have behaved well will go to eternal life, those who have behaved badl to eternal fire.This is the Catholic faith. Unless a man believes it faithfully and steadfastly, he will not be able to be saved.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A number object to those very last words, which in the old Book of Common Prayer translation are: "which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly". I find C.S.Lewis helpful over this: "The operative word is <em>keep</em>; not <em>acquire</em>, or even <em>believe</em> but <em>keep</em>. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters ... who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion, ... to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought." </p><p>Surely once a year we ought consciously to think about these things. That is because we cannot honestly escape what <em>The Athanasian Creed</em> summarizes. Its doctrines are statements that <em>follow</em> the facts and the mystery of God rather than explain them. They are like fences that surround the truth. They rule out wrong beliefs such as there being three gods or one God playing three roles. They help preserve the biblical revelation and stop the erosion of a living faith in Jesus Christ. The Trinity is the presupposition behind everything else - not only in the Bible but the universe. For the name of our God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit; but, in the words of <em>The Athanasian Creed</em> we must not "confuse" the [three] persons or "divide" the [one divine] substance.</p><p><em>(The above is an abbreviation of the Coloured Supplement for May 1997)</em></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Demographic Time Bomb">(August 2004) The Demographic Time Bomb</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2004</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Procreation of Children</strong></p><p>The Marriage Service in the old Anglican Book of Common Prayer (the doctrinal standard for the Church of England) is clear about the purposes of "holy matrimony". These include the procreation of children:</p>
<blockquote><div>It was ordained [among other things] for the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise of his holy Name.</div></blockquote>
<p>The modern service puts that as:</p>
<blockquote><div>It is given as the foundation of family life in which children may be born and nurtured in accordance with God's will, to his praise and glory.</div></blockquote>
<p>Since the 1960s with the devaluation of marriage and the married family there has been also a devaluation of that purpose of marriage, the procreation of children ["procreation" means "creating <em>on behalf of</em>" God]. Indeed, a growing "Christophobia", as it is now called, in the West has positively promoted anti-Christian alternative sexual lifestyles - from various forms of recreational sex, to heterosexual cohabitation, to homosexual relationships. These new lifestyles, particularly homosexual relationships, are now being positively "blessed" by Tony Blair's government, supported both by Tories and Lib Dems in the Civil Partnerships Bill that is still going through Parliament. Thankfully, after the prayers and encouragement of many Christian people, the House of Lords recently voted an amendment to prevent the bill being a "gay marriage" bill. The House of Commons now hasto respond in the Autumn.</p><p>The social price for ignoring God's created order - of no sex outside marriage and marriage as a lifelong commitment - is heavy. This became a commonplace in responsible social science in the 1990s (although ignored by much of the media and many in the educational empire and health services). Research proved conclusively that there are significant negative outcomes not only for adults but also for children from these new sexual arrangements. Now, however, in the early years of the 21st century the consequences of the devaluing of marriage are being seen to have much wider and deeper consequences of catastrophic proportions that will affect everyone - the innocent and the guilty. I refer to the "demographic time bomb". And the consequences are particularly serious for the UK and Europe.</p><p><br><strong>The UK and Europe</strong></p><p>A recent <em>Sunday Times Magazine </em>article was entitled "Bye, Bye Babies". Its headline was:</p>
<blockquote><div>A new population crisis is looming. We are turning our backs on parenthood and not producing enough babies. The over-80s are the fastest-growing age group, the under-16s the slowest. In years to come, there won't be enough workers to pay taxes, pensions and society's bills. We may have to work until we're 75.</div></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with what it calls "this Malthusian nightmare" when, it claims, "Productivity will plummet. Unemployment will soar. Education will become unaffordable ... To survive the EU will have to suck in large numbers of predominantly Muslim immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa. Its [the EU's] ambition to rival America is an empty dream."</p><p>The basis for these predictions is simple. To maintain a stable population you need women (on average) to produce in their lifetimes approximately 2.1 children each - this is "replacement fertility". In the UK it is now 1.6 - the lowest since records began in 1924 (Japan, Germany, and Italy are worse). Every country in the EU is below replacement level. Demographers are fearing the worst. "In historical terms," concludes a recent UN report, "the time available is short, and successful adaptation requires that we embark early on the path of societal change." Sadly, some married couples want but cannot have children; but in general this will require the overturning of anti-Christian assumptions and values that go back to Romantics in the 19th century, pagan intellectuals in the first part of the 20th century and the so called "liberalism" of the 1960's that validated human sin as acceptable behaviour and rejected traditional Christian sexual ethic and the "marriage family". Cohabitation, we are told, "does not rival marriage as an engine of procreation".</p><p>The economic seriousness is seen in the following ratios. In 2002 there were 3.35 people of working age for every one of pensionable age. By 2031 it will be 2.5 people. In 2050 (if there is no change and to restore the balance) pension age may have to increase to 73, pensioners accept 43% less income, or pension contributions increase by 76%. "By 2025," says the Employers Forum on Age, "for every two people employed there is likely to be one person over 50 who is retired or inactive."</p><p>One solution is increased immigration. With low fertility a Europe-wide problem, experts anticipate the vacuum being filled significantly by people from the more youthful and fertile Middle East and North Africa. This is already the case in France. "By the end of the 21st century," says David Willetts, "Europe&nbsp;could well have an increasingly Muslim south and east ... Europe is going to have to think much more carefully about relations with an Islamic population that is growing." But with immigrants it only takes 15 years for their birth-rates to drop to that of the indigenous population. According to UN projections,&nbsp;for the EU to maintain the current ratio of workers to pensioners 700 million new migrants will be needed by 2050 - seven times the predicted total population of Turkey.</p><p><br><strong>A Christian Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>George Weigel, an American commentator, asks the following questions:</p>
<blockquote><div>Why is Europe systematically depopulating itself? Why is Europe committing demographic suicide? Why does no Western European country have a replacement-level birth-rate? Why will Spain's population likely decline from 40 million to 31.3 million by the middle of the century? Why will 42 percent of Italians be over age sixty by 2050? What is happening when an entire continent wealthier and healthier than ever before, declines to create the human future in the most elemental sense, by producing a next generation? Why will Europeans not admit that these demographics—which are without parallel in human history, [excepting] wars, plagues, or natural catastrophes—are the defining reality of their twenty-first century?</div></blockquote>
<p>He gives an answer: "These questions cannot be answered satisfactorily by reference only to Europe's distinct experience of the twentieth century and what Europe learned from it, or by European shame. Deeper questions have to be raised: Why did Europe have the twentieth century it did? Why did a century that began with confident predictions about a maturing humanity reaching new heights of civilizational accomplishment produce, within four decades, two world wars, three totalitarian systems, a Cold War threatening global catastrophe, oceans of blood, mountains of corpses, Auschwitz and the Gulag? What happened? And why?"</p><p>His answer is this: "the deepest currents of history are spiritual and cultural, rather than political and economic. In this way of thinking, history is not simply the by-product of the contest for power in the world - although power certainly plays an important role in it. And neither is history the exhaust fumes produced by the means of production. Rather history is driven [from a human perspective], over the long haul, by culture - by what men and women honour, cherish and worship; by what societies deem to be true and good, and by the expressions they give to those convictions in language, and the arts; by what individuals and societies are willing to stake their lives on."</p><p>This is the classically Christian way of thinking about history. It is the Old Testament view of history. It was accepted by St Augustine in the early church (witness his <em>The City of God</em>). So Weigel argues the long-term answer to the demise of Europe will only be found in a revitalization of its Christian roots and "the rebirth of Christian conviction in Christianity's historic heartland. Europe, in other words, needs something like a Great Awakening ... a rebirth of life-transforming and culture-forming Christian conviction." Hence, basic Christian evangelism is vital. Christians need to pray for, and witness to, their secular, Muslim and "other religion" friends and neighbours. The gospel and the ethics of Christ are not only true but good - they make demographic and economic sense. As Jesus himself said: "seek first [God's] kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well" (Matt 6.33).</p><p><br><strong>Mid-Summer Madness</strong></p><p>But what do we find? Earlier this summer Tony Blair allowed the new European Constitution to drop references to God and Europe's Christian heritage. Then on the 23 July 2004 his next major European response was to appoint Peter Mandelson as Britain's new EU commissioner. The new commissioner has had a questionable public and private life. The Press informs us that contrary to God's laws through his homosexual choices he supports sexual relationships that by their very nature are the most sterile of all. A British Prime Minister should be encouraging the UK and Europe to recover and revalue heterosexual married life at a time when fertility is the desperate need. Pray for God's mercy on our nation and continent.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Liberty, Licence and Norman Dennis">(September 2004) Liberty, Licence and Norman Dennis</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2004</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>The philosophy of Jesmond Parish Church is summarized as "Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain". We want to see people mature as Christians; we want to see more Christians; and we want to see our country living more and more as God intended - for everyone's benefit. </p><p>One area for change was highlighted by Norman Dennis, the social scientist who taught for many years at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. In his recent book The Uncertain Trumpet - a history of Church of England School Education to AD 2001 he reported the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>In January 2001 a Mr Griffin, the owner of a sex-shop, was fined £5,826 after pleading guilty before York magistrates to the charge brought by the local authority that he had sold videos in his Grimsby and York shops that were only 'soft pornography', or were not reasonably pornographic at all (e.g. Secrets of a Sensual Nurse and Confessions of a Sex Maniac). His customers had thought from the titles they had selected for themselves that they were buying 'hard pornography'.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>What is Happening?</strong></p><p>It beggars belief that our sexual culture has so degenerated that you can be fined thousands of pounds for not selling hard pornography. What is happening? There is, what has been called, a "Loss of Outrage" in the post-modern world. Emile Durkeim, one of the founders of sociology, would say this was a desecration of the sacred. He argued for the importance of the distinction made (or ignored) between the sacred and the profane or what was taboo and what was common. He believed this was fundamental to understanding any society or group. What do people feel is serious or unimportant? What do people show reverence and respect for? What do they treat with indifference? When you ask these questions of the UK, you can see we now have a complete inversion of many values or beliefs. The "politically correct" is the new sacred, and fundamental beliefs and morals as taught by the Bible are "profaned". Many "call evil good and good evil" (Isaiah 5.20).</p><p>Dennis' own answer to the question "what is happening?" includes the role of popular culture:</p>
<blockquote><div>Modern art, drama and popular entertainment have been preoccupied with seeking out what is 'sacred' precisely in order to profane it. The disappearance of the sacred is not a problem only for the Church of England and its schools. For from the opposite standpoint, both art and entertainment, confronted with the thoroughly blasé audiences they have created, face the problem (apparently unbeknown to them) that they have almost exhausted their own raw material. The century-long project of 'shocking the bourgeoisie' itself loses all its meaning when there are so few English people left, bourgeoisie or respectable working class, whose sense of the sacred make them shockable by any profanity at all.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>The Loss of True Liberalism</strong></p><p>A deeper reason, apart from blatant human sin and the defiance of God's law, is the emergence of a new revisionist liberalism. The (old) western liberal tradition that is looked to with envy by many developing countries is one that accepts the rightness of the Christian or Judeao-Christian world view, but is tolerant of those with other beliefs or none. However, according to John Locke (the father of this tradition at the end of the 17th century), violence and (we must note) sexual immorality had to be restrained. Nor is this tolerance indifferentism.</p><p>This tradition, however, is being eroded by a new liberalism that says the public square has to be "naked". It has no place for any "right" tradition. This new liberalism, of course, goes back to the Biblical book of Judges, where "everyone did as he saw fit" (Judg 17.6). Its more recent lineage, however, goes back to the German philosopher Friederich Nietzsche who, as an atheist, was the first to speak of "the death of God". Naturally he said there was no absolute morality. You make it up for yourself. You are the arbiter of what is moral. However, your choices are not totally random because of the "will to power". He said that what people really want is power over others. So down the centuries structures have been built up and ways of speaking and acting - moralities - have evolved that enable some people to dominate others. Nietzsche was then followed by existentialists and relativists of various hues. What all had (and have) in common was (and is) a rejection of God's Divine Law or his Natural Law such as is summarized in the Ten Commandments and that even non-believers can recognize (Romans 2.14-15).</p><p>Sharing this perspective new Liberals hold that the State (or our life together in the public realm) is not entitled to reflect any one idea of "the good life". No particular set of beliefs, virtues or values can be considered better than others. The only value that is to be protected is "individual choice". </p><p><br><strong>Intolerant Liberty</strong></p><p>I first met Norman Dennis years ago when I was asked to give a lecture on Christianity and Politics to students at the University of Newcastle. At the end, in answer to a question I said that I would rather live in Newcastle, where there was freedom for Christian churches and for mosques, than in Tehran under the mullahs. But this public expression of preference was treated with horror by a number of students. One threatened to report me to the Race Relations Board. </p><p>Norman Dennis comments on this incident in his book as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>In this new scheme of intolerant liberty - passionately upheld on this occasion not by the most ignorant in society but by the best educated - everyone is permitted to hold any belief about data or morals they like, except the belief that they have good grounds for preferring, for the present, their version of the facts and morals to anybody else's.</div></blockquote>
<p>But such absolute openness leads to a devaluing of all values. You no longer respect another person for their views. Argument becomes impossible and irrelevant, if one preference is always as good as another. All that is left is for personal emotional reaction.</p><p><br><strong>John Locke</strong></p><p>No society can cohere on this basis. We are having a sophisticated form of licence or "libertinism", not liberalism. Our liberal forefathers would be horrified. John Locke wanted to steer a middle course between "a spirit of persecution" and "impunity for libertinism and licentiousness."</p><p>What was new with Locke and clearly defined by him, was the principle that religious beliefs may not be enforced by the State. After the Wars of Religion, conscience was now to be free. The State should never again exert its authority and power to make someone believe or confess what they did not believe or were willing to confess. Jesus, of course, had never enforced belief. </p><p>And the Christian doctrine of hell especially safeguards the concept of human freedom. If God does not compel people to trust him, but allows them to reject him even ultimately, so must we. In consequence there were to be no more burnings at the stake and no more imprisonment for the John Bunyans of this world. Every belief was to be tolerated. But you were not required to be silent over what you considered wrong or false. Toleration was not indifferentism. By definition, you can only tolerate what you think is wrong. In his (first) Letter Concerning Toleration of 1668 John Locke wrote this about not enforcing beliefs:</p>
<blockquote><div>But I would not have this understood as if I meant hereby to condemn all charitable admonitions and affectionate endeavours to reduce men from errors which are indeed the greatest duty of a Christian. Anyone may employ as many exhortations and arguments as he pleases, towards the promoting of another man's salvation. But all force and compulsion are to be forborne.</div></blockquote>
<p>Nor was there to be absolute toleration. Toleration has its limits. The State was not to tolerate violence or "promiscuous uncleanness" on the part of anybody, and certainly not on the part of those professing religious faith:</p>
<blockquote><div>If some congregations should have a mind to sacrifice infants, or, as the primitive Christians were falsely accused, lustfully pollute themselves in promiscuous uncleanness, or practice any other such heinous enormities, is the magistrate obliged to tolerate them, because they are committed in religious assembly? I answer, No.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Conclusion </strong></p><p>There are only three options for public life: to live under an authoritarian regime (as Islam often imposes); to live an autonomous existence where each is a law to themselves (as new secular liberalism is enforcing); or to live with a freely recognized authority. That authority, of course, needs to be the tolerant authority of Almighty God. His authority has been the ultimate authority of the western liberal tradition, certainly in the UK and the USA. Pray that it is so once again. And take action and speak out as and when it is appropriate. As Jesus said: "the truth [God's truth] will set you free" (John 8.32).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Fantasy Faith">(October 2004) Fantasy Faith</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2004</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                <p>It has well been said that when people cease to believe in the God of the Bible they don't believe in nothing: they believe in anything. A recent instance of this may be the huge success in the United States of the novel <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> by Dan Brown. People are now reading it in this country. Working on this <em>Coloured Supplement</em> in the train at the end of September, what should I see across the aisle but a woman reading this very book! James Hitchcock writes a good summary: "Dan Brown turns the biblical story into a thriller in which Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, a rich woman who financed his ministry, but after his death (there being no resurrection), the apostles conspired to suppress the truth in order to maintain male dominance." None of this is based on fact. As Hitler said (to justify his lying to millions): "the great masses of people ... will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one."</p><p>The so called "evidence" for such a view comes from the apocryphal <em>Gospel of Philip</em>, one of the documents found in 1945 in a cave near the town of Nag Hammadi in Egypt. These were "Gnostic" texts from the third to fourth centuries. We have known about the heresies of Gnosticism from the 2nd century writers Irenaeus and Tertullian. But here was more of the Gnostics own literature than we had before. However, we <em>already</em> knew the fictitious nature of what the Gnostics believed. That is why the early Church rejected Gnosticism. It was simply false. And these discovered documents confirm that the Church was right to do so. </p><p><br><strong>The Gospel of Philip</strong></p><p>The <em>Gospel of Philip</em> was probably written in the second half of the third century AD. As Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham, says: "that puts it as long after Jesus' life as we are today after the time of George the Second, when Handel and Bach were writing music and George Washington was a small boy ... it tells us a good deal about third-century practice in the Gnostic sect which wrote it, but nothing of any value about the first century." So what does it say about Jesus and Mary Magdalene? This: "the companion of the [Saviour is] Mary Magdalene. [But Christ loved] her more than [all] the disciples, and used to kiss her [often] on her [mouth]. The rest of [the disciples were offended] ... They said to him, 'Why do you love her more than all of us?' The Saviour answered and said to them, 'Why do I not love you as [I love] her?'" </p><p>But, as Tom Wright points out, that passage is sandwiched between such texts as: "God is a man-eater. For this reason men are sacrificed to him. Before men were sacrificed animals were being sacrificed, since those to whom they were sacrificed were not gods." And: "The Lord went into the dye works of Levi. He took seventy-two different colours and threw them into the vat. He took them out all white. And he said, 'Even so has the Son of Man come as a dyer.'" As Professor F.F.Bruce says: "A comparison of the New Testament writings with the contents of <em>The Nag Hammadi Library</em> should be instructive." It is!</p><p><br><strong>The New Testament</strong></p><p>The early Christians did compare these Gnostic writings with the New Testament and they judged them to be spurious. It is important to remember that the twenty-seven books of the New Testament are <em>not</em> the result of some arbitrary selection of some church synod or committee that sat round the table with a stack of Christian documents and said. "Let's decide which of these shall we say has divine authority." No! Rather it was when these twenty-seven books were generally accepted by Christians throughout the known world that then they were said to be authoritative. </p><p>So "when at last a Church Council gave a ruling on the matter, all that it did was to ratify the general consensus of Christians, who (we may believe) had been guided in this respect by a wisdom higher than their own ... Canonicity implies supreme authority in matters of faith. By including a document in the canon, the early Christians meant that it might be confidently appealed to in the establishment of matters of doctrine, whether in debates within the 'catholic' [the Greek word for the Latin word 'universal'] church itself or in disputes with heretics. But they included these writings in the canon because they already recognized their authority; the writings did not acquire authority by being included in the canon. One of the chief criteria (though not the only one) in recognizing the authority and canonical quality of a work was apostolic authority. So much was this so, that individuals or groups wishing to invest their own line of teaching with special authority liked to set it forth in the form of a 'Gospel', a book of 'Acts', an 'Epistle', or even an 'Apocalypse' [a 'Revelation'], bearing the name of an apostle" (F.F.Bruce). And so you have the Gnostic <em>Gospel of Philip</em>, the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>, the <em>Gospel of Peter</em>, the <em>Acts of John</em> and so on. </p><p><br><strong>Ancient Gnosticism</strong></p><p><em>Gnosis</em> is simply the Greek word for "knowledge". But in Gnosticism it was knowledge of a superior sort; and salvation came not through faith in Christ and his death for us on the cross with the victory of the Resurrection and the giving of the Holy Spirit, but through knowing (bizarre) secrets. The key secret was that Jesus came into this world to release the divine element that had become imprisoned in our flesh and lead it back home. So "the fall" was not rebellion against God, but being involved in the material world. Nor did the supreme God create the world. That was the work of the demiurge, often identified as the God of the Old Testament. So Gnosticism was "dualistic". It saw not one God, but two irreconcilable principles: spirit and matter, or light and darkness.</p><p>Some Gnostics became very ascetic, as in the heresy behind Paul's letter to the Colossians, "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!" (Col. 2.21). Some others said that if the spirit is everything and matter nothing, it doesn't matter what you do with your body - so indulge it if you wish. Gnostics did not accept the Incarnation of Jesus (matter being evil). They, therefore, asserted that the Gospels were not to be taken at face value but as stories with hidden symbolic meanings. So they felt free to write new gospels. The Gnostics did not see themselves bound by what may or may not have happened while Jesus was on earth. That is how they could say that Mary Magdalene become Jesus' lover, even though it was quite untrue and blasphemous. They could dismiss the New Testament as essentially false even though it was essentially true.</p><p><br><strong>Modern Gnosticism</strong></p><p>All this is so congenial to many moderns. It leads to distinguished scholars coming up with the most unlikely theories. Hence Elaine Pagels, an academic who specializes in Gnosticism, suggests that Thomas is written up as doubting Thomas in the New Testament in order to discredit the Gnostic <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>. There is not the slightest evidence whatsoever for this. But as "truth" for many is no longer important, what can you expect?</p><p>I first came across Elaine Pagels in an <em>Observer</em> article she wrote on Sunday 23 December 1979 - the sort of article "journalistic charlatans" (to quote Professor Charlie Moule) produce to destroy the faith of people at Christmas time. Referring to the Nag Hammadi texts her headline said, "they challenge traditional belief in the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection." In the Spring of the following year, 1980, her best-selling book, <em>The Gnostic Gospels</em> was published which expanded on her theories. </p><p>However, Pagels is not a disinterested scholar. 20 years later she made a confession. In her book <em>Beyond Belief</em> she says that she was brought up with an evangelical background, but couldn't cope with the way some people spoke about Hell. So she was turned off church. She still, however, chose to do a Doctorate in religious studies, in the course of which she read a text in the <em>Gospel of Thomas</em>: "if you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you." This had a profound effect on her. She said: "The strength of this saying is that it does not tell us what to believe but challenges us to discover what lies hidden within ourselves; and with a shock of recognition, I realized that this perspective seemed to me self evidently true." Her personal history may have affected the way she looks at the Gnostic texts.</p><p><br><strong>The Tragedy of Gnosticism</strong></p><p>This is so sad. For she and many ancient and modern Gnostics have a gospel of self-actualization, which is no gospel at all. The human predicament is that we cannot find the answers to life's problems within ourselves. We are not God. In the recent past, men and women have been trying to live as Gods. The result, in particular in the 20th century, was probably more killing and more suffering than in all previous history put together. No! We need the true God to reveal his truth to us. This he has done in history, climaxing in the death and the Resurrection (in history) of Jesus, as recorded in the Bible. The apostle Paul was spot on in his second letter to Timothy in a passage that is so important to remember amid all the confusions of today: </p>
<blockquote><div><em>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage - with great patience and careful instruction. For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry" (2 Timothy 4.1-5).</em></div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Christmas and Medical Ethics">(December 2004) Christmas and Medical Ethics</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2004</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Conception of Jesus Christ</strong></p>
<p>The early Christians were marked out for their opposition to abortion. They respected foetal life in a Roman world that saw little wrong with the practice. That respect has been dominant in the West until recently. Fundamental to this Christian understanding of life in the womb has been the accounts of Jesus' birth. From these it is clear that the incarnation (his coming in the flesh as a real man) began not with Christmas, but with his conception. As we say in the Creed: "He was conceived ... ."</p><p>Jesus reveals true man as well as true God. The inescapable conclusion, then, is that life in the womb is human from conception and so worthy of respect and protection from conception. What is in the womb is not blob of tissue but a human being - as Jesus was a human being in the womb of Mary. True, it is an embryonic human being and not an adolescent, adult or senile human being. But protection is demanded because here is the beginning of a creation that is in God's image. The primeval biblical prohibition against killing was based on humans, alone of the animal kingdom, being "in the image of God" (Genesis 9.6). Also the Bible teaches that human life is "given". It is not "achieved" by reaching certain standards of skill or competence. Our God is a "giver" - a God of grace. Job said, when bereaved, "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away" (Job 1.21).</p><p>But in today's world many are denying just that. They are saying that "achievements", in terms of physical, psychological and mental development determine what it means to be "human". This, of course, is the route taken by the Nazis in the first half of the 20th century. It gave rise to their eugenics, experimentations and, of course, the holocaust. However, the eventual horror of it all, by the end of the Second World War, then gave rise to a rediscovery of a sense of natural law - namely that some things are so immoral there can be no arguments for them. Such an ethical consciousness is hinted at in Romans 2.14-15. And Christians were in the fore in this rediscovery which then gave rise to the UN Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and, very significantly, the Medical Code of Ethics, the Declaration of Geneva, from the second General Assembly of the World Medical Association in 1948. This required the new doctor to say:</p>
<blockquote><div>I solemnly pledge myself to consecrate my life to the service of humanity ... I will practise my profession with conscience and dignity; the health and life of my patient will be my first consideration ... I will maintain the utmost respect for human life, from the time of its conception, even under threat. I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.</div></blockquote>
<p>But that has all now changed - witness the issue for us in Newcastle. This came to a head with the licensing by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) earlier this year for scientists at Newcastle's Centre for Life to carry out "therapeutic cloning". This was only the second official cloning project in the world. Last month (November 2004), however, a legal challenge was raised to the granting of the licence. But a number of business people want the challenge to fail as the project is hailed as "the key building block for the future of the regional economy". Others are offering hopes of miracle cures. But these are not yet in sight. Critics say these offers of hope are being used as "emotional manipulation".</p><p><br><strong>The Beginning of Life</strong></p><p>The heart of the ethical debate over embryo research and cloning relates to whether conception is the beginning of life or not. This debate has led people to reject the Geneva Declaration of 1948. This is due, I suggest, to regression from a Christian world view (in Europe in particular) and liberal churchmen in high places who seem to prefer the world's ethic to a biblical ethic. It was noticeable that the chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Stem Cell research was the Bishop of Oxford, Richard Harries known for his liberalism on human sexuality. He argued in the debate in the Lords in 2000 that he did not believe human life needed to be protected from the moment of conception. His arguments prevailed. The "fourteen day" rule has again been adopted.</p><p>But what are the facts? Embryologists seem to agree that "Human development begins at fertilization" and "Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed" - to quote two textbooks.</p><p>Following normal sexual intercourse a new individual gets half his/her chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm cell and half from the nucleus of the egg cell. The new organism that is produced is then genetically distinct from all other human beings and has started its own distinctive development. However, modern techniques have supplemented this natural process. One is where a sperm and egg unite in a laboratory dish and not in a woman's body. This is "in vitro fertilization" (IVF). But another is where no sperm is needed. Rather an egg has its nucleus removed which is then replaced by a nucleus from another type of cell - a body or "somatic" cell. The egg is then stimulated by an electrical charge and a living human being (or zygote) is created. This is cloning, with the body cell supplying the necessary chromosomes. Both IVF and cloning currently involve the creation of spare or redundant embryos.</p><p>But the new organisms produced both by fertilization and cloning are quite distinct entities. One bioethicist, William Saunders writes*:</p>
<blockquote><div>From its first moment, supplied with its complete set of chromosomes, each new zygote directs its own integral functioning and development. It proceeds, unless death intervenes, through every stage of human development until one day it reaches the adult stage ... but it will never undergo a change in its basic nature. It will never grow up to be a cow or a fish. It is a human being from the first moment of its existence. As Paul Ramsey has noted, 'The embryo's subsequent development may be described as a process of becoming what he already is from the moment of conception.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Moral Slippage</strong></p><p>So how have we allowed the creation of spare embryos to be discarded and treated like commodities in IVF treatments? How are we allowing some to be used for scientific experiments? One answer is that word games have been played. People now speak of a "pre-embryo" for an embryo prior to implantation in the womb. You can then argue it is not human until fourteen days of life and so it need not be protected. "Certainly," writes Saunders, "the embryo at this point is 'pre-implantation,' and certainly implantation is a highly significant event. If the embryo does not implant, it will die; if it implants, it will receive nutrition and a suitable environment in which to live, grow and develop (every human being at every stage of life similarly requires nutrition and a suitable environment). But the critical question is: Does implantation effect a change in the nature of the thing that implants? It is clear from the basic facts of embryology that it does not." The term pre-embryo was introduced in 1986 largely for public policy reasons as Lee Silver, a Princeton biology Professor and advocate of all the new biotechnologies, tells us in his Remaking Eden (1997):</p>
<blockquote><div>The term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by IVF practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. The new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between a six-day-old embryo and a sixteen-day-old embryo. The term is useful in the political arena - where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo experimentation - as well as in the confines of a doctor's [surgery] where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by IVF patients.</div></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, another word game has been played with cloning. After opinion polls found that people did not want any kind of "cloning", some decided to rename the procedure and call it "somatic [from the Greek word for body] cell nuclear transfer". This is mischievous. [See Saunders' arguments in The Human Embryo Debate in Human Dignity in the Biotech Century (2004)]</p><p><br><strong>July 2004</strong></p><p>In the US there is activity to halt the slide. Some are saying that in IVF treatments no more embryos are to be formed than the number of children patients are willing to parent. And last July, 2,165 US Christian medical professionals opposed to embryonic stem cell research wrote to President Bush. They pointed out that the earliest possible hope for any clinical applications from the research was 10-15 years away if ever. On the other hand, non-embryonic adult stem cells are ethically obtainable from multiple sources in human beings. In the last three years this work has shown significant progress and is already providing hope and therapy for patients suffering from heart muscle injury, diabetes and brain damage from stroke. It has realistic promise for treating other diseases on the horizon. Yet the media is giving little attention to this work. And sadly Europe has frustrated the US attempt at the end of November to check cloning world-wide through the UN. Surely we need to pray for God's mercy.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Paulinus and Josephine Butler">(January 2005) Paulinus and Josephine Butler</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2005</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Paulinus</strong></p>
<p>When I have a few days off after Christmas, I have often visited St Gregory's Church, Kirknewton, near Wooler in North Northumberland. I have always been challenged on these visits by two things <em>outside</em> the church building. First, as you travel along the Yetholm road, just before the Kirknewton, you pass a plaque by the roadside attached to a stone wall that says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>At this place wasGEFRINRoyal Township ofthe Seventh Century Anglo-SaxonKings of Northumbria.Here the missionary Paulinus in AD 627instructed the people in Christianity forthirty six days and baptized them in theRiver Glen close by.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Paulinus had been sent from Rome by Pope Gregory I in 601 to help Augustine and his mission in Kent. Sometime later in 625, Paulinus went north. This was when the (now Christian) daughter of the King of Kent, Ethelburga, married Edwin, king of Northumbria. She asked Paulinus to accompany her on her move to York. And it was in York, in 627, that her husband was converted and baptised. This was a significant moment in the evangelization of the North. According to Bede (of Jarrow) something of a revival occurred when Paulinus evangelized further north still in the area where the King and Queen had a residence near Kirknewton at Ad-Gefrin. Bede, recording this in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>so great was the fervour of faith and desire for baptism among the Northumbrian people that Paulinus is said to have accompanied the king and queen to the royal residence at Ad-Gefrin and remained there thirty-six days constantly occupied in instructing and baptising.</em></div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>"A great cloud of witnesses"</strong></p><p>It is good to remember that we are "surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses" - as Hebrews 12 verse 1 tells us. These were the witnesses of chapter 11 and included not only the great Old Testament heroes of the faith, but others who "were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection." Others "were stoned; they were sawn in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and ill-treated - the world was not worthy of them." We, surely, should believe that some of those early Northumbrian converts are also among that latter group of a great cloud of witnesses but, sadly according to Bede, not all. They did not all remain faithful. Six years after his conversion, Edwin was killed in battle by, says Bede, "Cadwalla of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia." He then says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>A reign of terror was unleashed on the north country as Edwin's kingdom was mercilessly ravaged by his vengeful conquerors. His queen fled home to Kent and with her went the priest Paulinus, leaving many of those he had converted to revert to their pagan practices.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>However, before long King Oswald, from his fortress at Bamburgh restored control of the area and asked the Irish missionary from Iona, Aidan, to continue the Christian mission. Aidan came and established a monastery on Holy Island, from which countless missionaries went out preaching and teaching (the ruins of the monastery, of course, are still there). The "Golden Age," as it is called, of Christianity in the North was dawning.</p><p>The site of Gefrin is less than a mile from Kirknewton Parish Church. This tiny church relates to JPC as the Tyne Bridge does to Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Tyne Bridge is a miniature of Sydney Harbour Bridge. Kirknewton is a miniature of JPC. John Dobson, who designed JPC (and many of the well known Victorian buildings in the city of Newcastle) was responsible for the last restoration of this ancient village church in 1856 - a restoration that was completed in 1860. And JPC was completed in 1861. Some of the building work must have been going on at the same time in both places, with JPC being influenced by Dobson's plans for Kirknewton rather than the other way round. But, more importantly - and this is the second reason why I find the visit to Kirknewton challenging - not far from the door of the church is the grave of Josephine Butler.</p><p><br><strong>Josephine Butler</strong></p><p>Josephine Butler died, in Wooler, on 30 December 1906. On 31 December last year the newspapers reported that the Home Office was conducting a review of prostitution. <em>The Times</em> reported that "Brothels could be legalised as part of an overhaul of the law on prostitution that aims to undermine the grip that organised crime has on the sex industry." An article then appeared by Joan Smith that was headed: "Forget about 'vice', legalise brothels to protect women." Josephine Butler would have been turning in her grave. Her great life's work - "the cause" as she called it - was to fight against the legalization of prostitution that came with the Contagious Diseases Act of 1864. </p><p>Born in Milfield (near Kirknewton) on 13 April 1828, her father, John Grey, was a man of strong Christian conviction and a supporter of Wilberforce in his opposition to the slave trade; her mother, Hannah, was from a godly Huguenot family who lived in Alnwick and had entertained John Wesley. From an early age Josephine was made aware of social wrongs. At seventeen, she wrote that "so great was the burden on my soul about the inequalities, injustice and cruelties in the world, that I used to run away into these woods [around Corbridge - to where her family had moved] where no one followed me" and she would literally cry out to God. In 1852 she married George Butler, an Oxford Don, with whom she had a wonderfully happy marriage. Then in 1857 George moved to Cheltenham College where the couple had the terrible experience of their young daughter, Eva, falling to her death over some banisters in their home. In 1866 George became principal of Liverpool College and there was a move back north. For a period Josephine had been working for women's education. But then in 1869 some doctors asked her to lead a protest by women against the Contagious Diseases Acts (1864, 1866 and 1869). She agreed and formed the Ladies National Association for Repeal.</p><p>Her work was costly. She tells us that like Jonah, she didn't want to do it. "I worked hard at other things - good works as I thought - with a kind of half conscious hope that God would accept that work and not require me to go further and run my heart against the naked sword which seemed to be held out. But the hand of the Lord was upon me ... " She knew that she would be abused and mocked and her husband would come under fire as well. But seventeen years, hundreds of letters, hundreds of meetings and interviews, many books and pamphlets, much public speaking, many days of prayer, much vitriol, and even physical attacks later, in 1886 she saw the repeal of these Acts.<br>The Acts had legalized prostitution. There was a concern, particularly in the Port towns, for the amount of venereal disease. The army and navy, so the argument went, ought to have "clean women". So the Police were given draconian powers to ensure this happened with the legalizing of prostitution. The result was a demeaning of women but <em>no</em> reversal of venereal disease. Josephine's campaign majored on two fronts - justice and immorality. First, it was unjust that women (and not men) were the entire focus of the Government's legislation because women were thought to be the main cause of vice. It was assumed that men needed prostitutes! Secondly, prostitution is immoral and wrong. In 1872, in the Pontefract Parliamentary Election, where she and others were trying to unseat the sitting MP for his views and voting, the argument was: "If you vote for Mr Childers, you endorse the sentiment that a holy life is impossible for unmarried men, and that women must be provided for them by the State, and sacrificed, both body and soul, to their lust - a sentiment which blasphemes God, insults manhood, and destroys both men and women."</p><p><br><strong>Lessons</strong></p><p>Josephine Butler was a remarkable woman of prayer; and she kept a biblical balance between working for equality for women and recognizing the differences between men and women. Also she opposed what today is called the policy of "harm reduction". In 1871 John Stuart Mill who supported Josephine summarized their opposition to "harm reduction" for the Royal Commission on the Acts as follows. It was not the business of the government to provide securities beforehand against the consequences of immorality. That, he said, was not the same as remedying the consequences after they occur. To this he saw no objection. Such "harm reduction" policies lie behind "safer sex" education programmes today. As in Josephine's day, they seem not to be working but to be leading to an increase of disease by legitimizing behaviours.</p><p>Josephine had a simple faith in Christ. Just before her death, finding life hard, she wrote this: "I have been reflecting that Jesus trod the bitterest part of the way of the cross at the <em>close</em> of his earthly life. If some of us have to do the same ... and find the way of the cross rather hard at the end, we cannot complain. For, as with our Lord, we see Victory so near; and the joy of his presence is so great, flowing side by side with pain." We can all learn from Josephine Butler.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="John Newton - The Forgotten Hero">(February 2005) John Newton - The Forgotten Hero</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2005</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p>The claim that "Christian doctrine is grace and Christian ethics is gratitude" has considerable truth. At this time of our giving review, I do not want to write about our showing practical gratitude in response to God's grace to us in Christ through giving money. Rather I want to write about John Newton, the great hymn-writer on grace. His most famous hymn, of course, is "Amazing Grace".</p><p><br><strong>J.C.Ryle's Omission</strong></p><p>A book I commend to people very warmly in J.C.Ryle's Christian Leaders of the 18th Century. I have tried to follow the example of Canon Christopher of St.Aldate's, Oxford who once said that "he had turned to Ryle's book during every summer vacation for thirty years." </p><p>The book, I believe, is important because the 18th century of those Christian leaders has some parallels with today. According to Ryle inside the churches "sermons everywhere were little better than miserable moral essays, utterly devoid of anything likely to awaken, convert, or save souls." And writing of the situation outside the churches, Joseph Butler, later Bishop Durham, said:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>it has come to be taken for granted that Christianity is no longer a subject of inquiry; but that it is now at length discovered to be fictitious. And accordingly it is treated as if, in the present age, this were an agreed point among all persons of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a principal subject for mirth and ridicule, as it were by way of reprisals for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the world.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>But all that changed with the 18th century Evangelical Revival. Ryle decided to write about the leaders of that revival on the grounds that "to know the men whom God raised up to do his work in days gone by, will guide us in looking about for standard-bearers in our own days and days to come." So he wrote about Whitefield, Wesley, Grimshaw, Romaine, Rowlands, Berridge, Venn, Walker, Hervey, Toplady and Fletcher. For some reason he omitted John Newton. Perhaps his early life was too lurid!</p><p><br><strong>John Newton (1725-1807)</strong></p><p>Newton has been described as "one of the most colourful figures" in the 18th century Evangelical Revival. He wrote his own epitaph for his death in 1807 as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, by the rich mercy of Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had long laboured to destroy.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Chris Idle, no mean modern hymn writer himself, gives us this cameo of his life:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>A violent storm at sea was the turning-point in John Newton's life. Motherless at six and sent to sea on his eleventh birthday, he soon became a teenage rebel. He was press-ganged into the navy and flogged for desertion. Newton became involved with the African slave-trade and came close to starvation while living in extreme poverty in Sierra Leone. But in March 1748, at the age of twenty-three, he was on board a cargo ship which was fighting for its life against heavy seas and rough weather. Worn out with pumping and almost frozen, he called out for God's mercy at the height of the storm, and was amazed to be saved from almost certain death. Newton's life had many twists and turns. Eventually he renounced his involvement with slave-trading and, at thirty nine, became a minister in the Church [of England]. He persuaded the young William Wilberforce to stay in politics and joined him in the fight to abolish the slave-trade.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So<em> Amazing Grace</em> is Newton's personal testimony. An understanding of his life makes the hymn come so much more alive:</p>
<blockquote><div>Amazing grace! how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me!I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved;How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed!Through many dangers, toils, and snares I have already come;'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far And grace will lead me home.Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail And mortal life shall ceaseI shall possess within the veil A life of joy and peace.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><strong>Newton's Gift and Some of his Sayings</strong></p><p>Newton was not a great up-front evangelist like many of Ryle's heroes. Rather he was a personal counsellor. Someone has called him "the great spiritual director of souls in the Evangelical Movement." Marcus Loane, a former Archbishop of Sydney, calls him "the letter writer <em>par excellence </em>of the Evangelical Revival." In one of his letters he speaks of how clergy differ in their gifts and theological interests: "So far as I can judge, anatomy is my favourite branch; I mean the study of the human heart with its workings and counter-workings as it is differently affected in a state of nature or of grace, in the different seasons of prosperity, adversity, conviction, temptation, sickness and the approach of death." </p><p>Thank God for his gift to the church of John Newton. Nothing compares to reading Newton himself. Banner of Truth publish an accessible collection of the <em>Letters of John Newton</em>. In the meantime here are few random quotes (downloaded from the web), but each one a gold-mine in different ways:</p><p>"'What Thou wilt, when Thou wilt, how Thou wilt.' I had rather speak these three sentences from my heart in my mother tongue than be master of all the languages in Europe."</p><p>"If ever I reach heaven I expect to find three wonders there: first, to meet some I had not thought to see there; second, to miss some I had expected to see there; and third - the greatest wonder of all - to find myself there."</p><p>"I am not what I ought to be. I am not what I want to be. I am not what I hope to be. But still, I am not what I used to be. And by the grace of God, I am what I am."</p><p>"The Lord afflicts us at times; but it is always a thousand times less than we deserve, and much less than many of our fellow-creatures are suffering around us. Let us therefore pray for grace to be humble, thankful, and patient."</p><p>"The love I bear Christ is but a faint and feeble spark, but it is an emanation from himself. He kindled it and he keeps it alive; and because it is his work, I trust many waters shall not quench it."</p><p>"When everything we receive from him is received and prized as fruit and pledge of his covenant love, then his bounties, instead of being set up as rivals and idols to draw our heart from him, awaken us to fresh exercises of gratitude and furnish us with fresh motives of cheerful obedience every hour."</p><p>"I am persuaded that love and humility are the highest attainments in the school of Christ and the brightest evidences that he is indeed our Master."</p><p>"God often takes a course for accomplishing His purposes directly contrary to what our narrow views would prescribe. He brings a death upon our feelings, wishes and prospects when He is about to give us the desire of our hearts."</p><p>"I endeavour to keep all Shibboleths, and forms and terms of distinction out of sight, as we keep knives and razors out of the way of children; and if my hearers had not some other means of information, I think they would not know from me that there are such creatures as Arminians and Calvinists in the world. But we [would] talk a good deal about Christ."</p><p>"I compare the troubles which we have to undergo in the course of the year to a great bundle of fagots, far too large for us to lift. But God does not require us to carry the whole at once. He mercifully unties the bundle, and gives us first one stick, which we are to carry today, and then another, which we are to carry tomorrow, and so on. This we might easily manage, if we would only take the burden appointed for each day; but we choose to increase our troubles by carrying yesterday's stick over again today, and adding tomorrow's burden to the load, before we are required to bear it."</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Prince Charles Addresses the Nation on Divorce and Remarriage (A Dream)">(March 2005) Prince Charles Addresses the Nation on Divorce and Remarriage (A Dream)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2005</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>I have a dream. It is that sometime during this month of March (2005) Prince Charles addresses the nation as did his great uncle, Edward VIII. But it is not to announce his "abdication" as heir to the throne in favour of William. It is to announce that his relationship with Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles has ended. That is because as King he would be the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and would have to swear in the Coronation Oath to "maintain and preserve the laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel." He also would have to swear to maintain and preserve "the doctrine, worship, discipline and government" of the Church of England. However, Andrew Parker Bowles, to whom Camilla was married in 1973, is still living, and the relationship between her and himself contributed to the break-up of that marriage. It also contributed to the break-up of his marriage to Princess Diana. So he now realizes that there are theological and practical barriers that prevent him proceeding with the proposed remarriage on 8 April. He also realizes that there needs to be a new culture in the nation that promotes life-long marriage. To that end examples have to be set by those in public positions. He wants to be one of the first to set an example.</p><p>So my dream is that the Prince makes a short statement outlining the above. But he then gives a longer address explaining in more detail his new thinking. In Anglican fashion he argues from Scripture, Tradition and Reason, but reverses that order and says something like the following and beginning with the issue of divorce.</p><p><br><strong>Reason</strong></p><p>The latest UK divorce figures are for 2003 and show an increase of 3.7 percent to nearly 167,000. 44 years ago these were 27,000 (in 1961) and 45 years before that in 1914 they were only 1000. This divorce explosion began in the 1960s. What was happening? Several things. <em>First</em>, there was a new philosophy. In the 1960's "happiness", for many people, came to be seen fundamentally as the result of subjective feelings rather than objective social, familial or economic conditions. There was now talk about "self-esteem", "self-validation", "finding oneself" and "feeling good about oneself". This new expressive individualism then redefined commitment as a form of "self-commitment". Your first and foremost obligation was to yourself. Not surprisingly the family became less and less a place for a mother and father to fulfil their duties of parenthood and more and more as a place for exploring their self-hood unfettered by roles, rules and duties. And divorce had a new "lease of life". Previously it was seen as the last remedy for a failed marriage. Now, in the words of Barbara Whitehead, it was "the psychologically healthy response to marital dissatisfaction."</p><p><em>Secondly</em>, there was the rise of radical feminism, with Germain Greer claiming that "most women ... would shrink at the notion of leaving husband and children, but this is precisely the case in which brutally clear rethinking must be undertaken." Kate Millet went so far as to say "the complete destruction of traditional marriage and the nuclear family is the 'revolutionary or utopian' goal of feminism." <em>Thirdly</em> and less extreme, or so it seemed, were the changes in the law at this same time. One distinguished law Professor has said that these resulted in the "virtually universal understanding that the breakdown of a marriage is irretrievable if one spouse says it is." <em>Fourthly</em>, at the same time in the churches there was a "new morality" teaching that "anything is permitted, if there is love" - but without defining what "love" is. John Robinson, an Anglican Bishop, wrote a best seller entitled <em>Honest to God</em>. It included a chapter entitled "the New Morality" where the bishop dismisses the doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage as a relic of an outdated and untenable supernaturalism. Rather it is related to "a world of occult realities". He quoted with approval another new moralist, Professor Joseph Fletcher, who said: "if the emotional and spiritual welfare of both parents and children in a particular family can be served best by a divorce, wrong and cheap jack as divorce commonly is, then love requires it."</p><p><em>Fifthly</em>, there was also, another and more subtle shift taking place. Prior to the 1960s, as the divorce rate was rising, there was a general feeling that this was very wrong and needed to be restrained. This explains the outcry against King Edward VIII in 1936 and his subsequent abdication. Even in 1947 the famous judge, the late Lord Denning, could say (with his inimitable West Country accent): "some young people approach marriage with the feeling that if it does not work out well they can always get a divorce. If that goes on, we shall be approaching the stage of universal trial marriage. It is a serious state of affairs." But in the 1960's divorce, remarriage and stepfamilies were less and less seen as problems. In fact some saw them as useful resources in the armoury of remaking yourself. It helped you gain competencies such as initiative, assertiveness and a stronger and better self-image. Barbara Whitehead puts it clearly:</p>
<blockquote><div>Traditionally, one major impediment to divorce was the presence of children in the family ... This notion was swiftly abandoned after the 1960s. Influential voices in the society, including child-welfare professionals, claimed that the happiness of individual parents, rather than an intact marriage, was the key determinant of children's family well-being. If divorce could make one or both parents happier, then it was likely to improve the well-being of children as well.</div></blockquote>
<p>But then social science began to see that all was not well with children. However, few were heard publicly saying that the problem related to the assault on the marriage family. In Parliament "right-wingers" were heard to be saying that it was abortion, free contraceptives, illegitimacy and homosexuality that were destroying the family; "left-wingers" were heard to say the problem was domestic violence, economic deprivation and inadequate social service support for single parents. Few mentioned divorce and remarriage. "Right-wingers" probably did not want to alienate their wealthy and libertarian supporters who favoured easy divorce (nor to draw attention to the divorced and remarried leaders in their own ranks). "Left-wingers" probably were unwilling to alienate the large support they had from "feminist" women and single parents.</p><p>The result has been that the chattering classes and middle-classes view family breakdown and family problems as something to do with "them" and not "us". It is a problem caused by unwed mothers and those on social security benefits. They often seem blind to the instability of marriage caused by "respectable" families that break-up. Furthermore, this "blindness" has gone along with a new social ethic of commitment to <em>all</em> children in the mass. This is good. But it will be of no avail without the individual responsibility of each mother and father caring for <em>their</em> children.</p><p>But change is happening. Nor was this change motored by clergy and the church. No! It was the result of social scientists. A pioneer was Judith Wallerstein who began studying the children of divorce in 1969. Like other experts she expected to find that within months of the trauma the youngest children would fully recover. However, eighteen months after a divorce, she found a high rate of sudden, serious psychological problems. Sixty-five percent of the children who had been functioning well before the divorce began to experience inability to concentrate in school, trouble eating or sleeping, difficulty making friends, and withdrawn or hostile behaviour. At first it seemed that older children coped better than younger ones. But longitudinal studies showed the reverse. Ten years after a divorce, the older siblings showed signs of distress – inability to trust others, and difficulty forming lasting bonds with members of the opposite sex. And on nearly every measure of childhood well-being, children of divorce scored lower than children from intact families. Even ten years after divorce she found, children felt "less protected, less cared for, and less comforted" than children in intact families. Significantly children of divorce are much more likely to divorce themselves. These, of course, are averages. There are shining exceptions. But the averages cannot be denied.</p><p>But not only is it children who suffer. Adults also suffer through divorce - physically and emotionally. Indeed, the whole of society is affected. Judith Wallerstein cites Pat Conroy who observed when his own marriage broke up "each divorce is the death of a small civilization." And she says: "Today, all relationships between men and women are profoundly influenced by the high incidence of divorce ... Teachers from all over the country tell me that their students come to school wide-eyed with fear, saying that their parents quarrelled the night before and asking in terror, 'Does that mean they are going to divorce?' Radical changes in family life affect all families, homes, parents, children, courtships and marriages, silently altering the social fabric of the entire society."</p><p>Nor does remarriage help. One study has suggested that 62 percent of remarriages among women under age forty will end in divorce, and the likelihood is increased if children are involved. The latest report from the UK Government on divorce statistics says, "demographic factors associated with an increased risk of subsequent divorce include ... having previously been married." There is now a growing body of research that suggests children might be better off in single parent families than in stepfamilies. The UK National Child Development Study, a longitudinal analysis of seventeen thousand children born in 1958, found that the chances for stepchildren suffering social deprivation before becoming adults are even greater than for children living with one divorced parent. However, remarriages and stepfamilies preceded by death are much different to those preceded by divorce. In fact remarriages after widowhood, in contrast to remarriages after divorce, have a lower divorce rate than first marriages.</p><p>The effects of this "divorce and remarriage" culture are cumulative. In the 1960's when the "new age" was beginning, a clergy-psychiatrist said this:</p>
<blockquote><div>A couple who face the problems of married life are [now] aware that a host of others who failed to solve them got out of them by divorce; and the knowledge adds to their task. Their energies and their emotions are less than fully engaged. They do not 'need' to succeed; and success is therefore more difficult. And the vicious spiral goes on.</div></blockquote>
<p>Margaret Mead, the anthropologist, also described the emotional strain in a divorcing society where husbands and wives nevertheless hope they can maintain their marriage. When divorce is a fairly open door, enormous care to satisfy the other partner and not to arouse his or her suspicions is required. An emotional clutchingness which is very wearing, "an endless incitement to anxious effort," has to do duty for what in former generations was performed by the unshakeable conviction that marriage was permanent. "It was safe to be romantic when there was no real danger that new romances could tempt you away."</p><p>All this may seem so harsh. So we must be very careful how we all react. First we must show gentleness and compassion to individuals who find themselves in broken homes and broken marriages. Many of them are there through no fault of their own and no choice of their own. But to quote Glen Stanton:</p>
<blockquote><div>we must also rediscover a sense of moral outrage at the devaluation of marriage as an institution. We must rouse ourselves and find the courage and ability to make moral judgments. When a culture does not permit itself to make value statements about one thing being qualitatively better than another, that culture has removed the primary organ allowing it to make progress and better itself.</div></blockquote>
<p>And we must be outraged not because this new "divorce culture" fails to live up to some nostalgic ideal, but because people, including children, are being damaged.</p><p>That is why we must all work to re-establish a strong marriage culture. That will require two things. It will require <em>personal</em> commitment and <em>societal</em> expectation. Over the last forty years we have lost our <em>social</em> ethic. Marriage is fundamentally a <em>social</em> reality that relates the individual to the wider society. It is, as the old Anglican Book of Common Prayer calls it, "an estate". It is a little "society" within which relationships can be worked at and made to thrive. And the knowledge that it is unbreakable and should be exclusive until death enables a level of freedom for the relationship to be honest and so more healthy. "If love and marriage," says social scientist Ann Swidler, in <em>Habits of the Heart</em>, "are seen primarily in terms of psychological gratification, they may fail to fulfil their older social function of providing people with stable, committed relationships that tie them to a larger society."</p><p>So how do we go about re-establishing a marriage culture? Certainly we need to rethink our "relationships' education" strategy. Our educational focus needs to shift from trying to prevent out-of-wedlock <em>births</em> to preventing out-of-wedlock <em>sexual activity</em>. We now know that sex before marriage and cohabitation reduces the level of permanency in marriage, as well as the fact that children of cohabitees also score less well than the children of married parents over a range of developmental indicators. Also the increase of sexually transmitted diseases will only be assuredly reversed with a policy of "wait until marriage". Far from reducing sexual satisfaction, we also now know that the ethic of sex exclusively within marriage is the best way to physical and emotional sexual fulfilment. Other sexual ethics produce, as has been said, "more frustration, disappointment and pain."</p><p>We also need to change our laws. No-fault divorce laws which we now have in the UK effectively abolish traditional marriage in a legal sense. From a legal point of view, it seems that ultimately the only factor that now holds a marriage together is the simultaneous commitment of two individuals. While that personal commitment is vital, marriages need social and legal support. That must be restored if marriages are to be restored - for the good of children, adults and society at large. And we need our churches to rediscover a marriage ethic. Too many have bought into the "me" culture of expressive individualism. "Pastoral counselling," we are told, for some time has taken "a client-centred approach that required clergy to stay within the client's 'value system'. Pastors (and congregations) retreated from theological challenge to an individual's values on the psychotherapeutic ground that such a challenge would be damaging to the individual's selfhood and would come across as 'preachy' and 'moralistic'." Not surprisingly in the United States where much better research has been conducted than in Britain, researchers have discovered that 25 per cent of "conservative Protestants" - those who would claim to be "bible believing" - have been through divorce, exactly the same percentage as those in the total population. Then, finally, there needs to be the example of high profile figures in public life. There needs to be a new role-modelling. </p><p><br><strong>Tradition</strong></p><p>The tradition of the early church was almost unanimous on divorce and remarriage. It was this that gave the Christian community its identity over against the Roman world that had a much laxer sexual code. One scholar summarizes the early church Fathers' position like this:</p>
<blockquote><div>in the first five centuries all Greek writers and all Latin writers except one agree that remarriage following divorce for any reason is adulterous. The marriage bond was seen to unite both parties until the death of one of them. When a marriage partner was guilty of unchastity, usually understood to mean adultery, the other was expected to separate but did not have the right to remarry.</div></blockquote>
<p>Also in the early centuries of the church, the Fathers followed the New Testament in teaching equality of sexual rights in marriage. That was in contrast to the Old Testament, Jewish and Roman law. These gave more freedom to married men than married women. In the Old Testament a married man could have more than one sexual partner without being guilty of adultery against his first wife. But a married woman had to be totally faithful to her husband. Also Roman men could have concubines as well as a wife.</p><p>The wider culture of the early centuries of the Church was similar to today's culture. Even after the accession of Constantine, the first "Christian" emperor, Roman marriage law hardly changed. With full divorce freely available, some within the Church drifted away from Church teaching and were divorced and remarried. But this did not alter that teaching. Rather such people were disciplined - so seriously did the Church treat obedience to Christ regarding marriage. As today there were people who tried to justify their behaviour. Augustine of Hippo tells us of one man who said that the adulterous partner should be considered <em>as</em> dead; and so the innocent partner should be permitted to remarry on the basis that death terminates a marriage. Augustine disagreed.</p><p>Of course, the church Fathers ruled that there could be separation, when needed, "from bed and board" (<em>separatio <em>a thoro et mensa</em></em>). There was also the concept of an absolute "annulment" of a marriage, or "nullity" by insisting that from the outset the marriage had not lawfully been contracted. It had never been a marriage in the first place - for example when marrying within the "forbidden degrees", that is to say, when marrying a close relative. Over the mediaeval period, however, the "grounds" for such annulments grew in number. This led to much abuse in the eyes of reformers. It made a mockery of the teaching of Jesus. It was a legalistic way of having easy divorce while telling yourself you were upholding strict church teaching. In the Roman Catholic church Erasmus worked for reform by arguing for the right to remarriage after separation through reinterpreting key texts. His arguments, however, did not convince.</p><p>Many of the Protestant Reformers also wanted reform regarding divorce, such as Luther in Germany, Calvin in Switzerland and Knox in Scotland. They accepted the traditional interpretation of the marriage texts, but they argued for divorce by resurrecting the argument similar to the one Augustine rejected. Wenham and Heth summarize Luther's position as this:</p>
<blockquote><div>His starting point is that only death can dissolve the marriage tie and leave the partner free to marry again. The act of adultery, however, makes the offender <em>as dead</em> in his relationship both to God and to his partner ... Moses demanded that the adulterer be put to death and he believed that the existing civil powers should do likewise. If this was not done, the adulterer was still considered as dead in the eyes of God.</div></blockquote>
<p>Similarly both Calvin and Knox argued that the adulterer or adulteress was to <em>reckoned as a dead man or woman</em>. Death, they said, dissolves the marriage bond. If the guilty party was not punished but allowed to go on living, that was the fault of the <em>civil</em> authority. The Church could not be held to ransom by the state failing to do its duty.</p><p>This Calvinistic position is reflected in the teaching of the 17th century Presbyterian Westminster Confession, XXIV.5: "In the case of adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce, and, after the divorce, to marry another, <em>as if the offending party were dead</em>." That is why remarriage in the Church of Scotland is possible today.</p><p>But the Church of England took a different position at the Reformation. While some wished to allow for divorce and remarriage following the Continental Reformers, the mainstream of the Anglican Reformers decided to return to the patristic tradition of the early church. So the doctrine and practice of the Church of England became that of the Canons of 1597 that were incorporated into the Canons of 1604. Canon 106 provided only for "separation <em>a thoro et mensa</em>, or for the annulling of pretended matrimony [nullity]". Canon 107 was entitled "<em>In all sentences for Divorce, Bond to be taken for not marrying during each other's Life</em>." It said this:</p>
<blockquote><div>In all sentences pronounced for divorce and separation <em>a thoro et mensa</em>, there shall be a caution and restraint inserted in the act of the said sentence, That the parties so separated shall live chastely and continently; neither shall they, during each other's life, contract matrimony with any other person. And, for the better observation of this last clause, the said sentence of divorce shall not be pronounced until the party or parties requiring the same have given good and sufficient caution and security into the court, that they will not any way break or transgress the said restraint or prohibition.</div></blockquote>
<p>The Church of England was more concerned about remarriage even than about divorce. It saw that sometimes a "separation from bed and board" was inevitable (and biblical). But it refused to sanction divorce <em>a vinclo</em> (from the bond of marriage) with the right to remarry.</p><p>There were, of course, as today differences of opinion. But for good or ill - and the judgment of history is surely that it was for good - the Church of England developed a unique position in Christendom regarding divorce and remarriage. Returning to the ethic of the early church, it got rid of the abuses of the nullity system of the Roman Church, while resisting the desire to relax the teaching of Christ to allow more easy divorce, as happened in some of the non-Anglican Protestant Reformed churches. </p><p>The tradition of the Pilgrim Fathers, for example, undoubtedly has left a negative mark on the United States (for all the good that tradition undoubtedly represents). In New England the colonists objected to the restrictive English divorce laws. "The Puritan dissenters," writes one commentator, "took issue with the conservatism of the Church of England in retaining Roman Catholic doctrines respecting divorce. Not surprisingly, the Puritan strongholds of Massachusetts and Connecticut had the most liberal provisions for divorce as well as the most divorces in the seventeenth century."</p><p>The Anglican tradition, however, held firm in England. With the Ecclesiastical Courts granting divorce only <em>a thoro et mensa</em>, the only way for a divorce <em>a vinclo</em> with the permission to remarry could be by Act of Parliament. From 1670 (the date of the first such Act of Parliament) to 1857 (the date of the Matrimonial Causes Act that set up a special court empowered to dissolve marriages a vinclo on the grounds of adultery) there were 317 Acts passed. That is to say, only three divorces (as we understand them) every two years. Conservative Christians, like Keble, the Oxford Tractarian, were opposed to the 1857 Act. Liberal Churchmen like F.D.Maurice welcomed it. Middle-of-the-road churchmen like Mandell Creighton said: "We as Christians abhor divorce, but when divorce has been judged necessary are we to refuse any liberty to the innocent and wronged party?"</p><p>But the mainstream of the Anglican tradition judged that the loving action was not to go with the "liberal drift" but to stand firm. So the Lambeth Conference of 1908 affirmed that the remarriage of neither the guilty nor the innocent party should receive the blessing of the Church. The 1920 Lambeth Conference reaffirmed as "our Lord's principle and standard of marriage a lifelong and indissoluble union". The 1930 Lambeth Conference went further. It said no marriage of a divorced person with a partner living should be celebrated with the rites of the Church and that where an innocent party had remarried and desired to receive Holy Communion, the case should be referred to the bishop. It was this 1930 resolution that formed the basis for all subsequent pronouncements and discipline in the Church of England until 2002. The summary of this Anglican position was given by a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. He said:</p>
<blockquote><div>the attitude of the Church of England, shortly put, is a) no marriage in church of any divorced person with a partner still living, since the solemnizing of a marriage is a formal and official act of the Church, and the Church must not give its official recognition to a marriage which (for whatever cause) falls below our Lord's definition of what marriage is: b) but the relation of such people to the Church or their admission to Communion is another matter, one of pastoral care for the sinner and properly a matter of pastoral discretion.</div></blockquote>
<p>But the appointment in 2002 of a new Archbishop of Canterbury with a liberal stance on sexual morality gave a new confidence to "theological liberals" in the Church of England. So it was not surprising that centuries of Anglican tradition were voted down by the General Synod in 2002, with the bishops leading the way. While 32 percent of the laity opposed the change and 24 percent of the clergy, only 4 percent of the bishops present and voting did!</p><p>In one sense the doctrine of the Church of England remains the same. The current Canon B 30 that states marriage should always be undertaken as a "solemn, public and life-long covenant between a man and a woman" remains in place. Nor, according to the <em>Worship and Doctrine Measure 1974 </em>- and this is most important - is the Church of England permitted to depart from the doctrine of marriage implied in the Book of Common Prayer. This does not provide for remarriage. Rather in that service the couple are asked: "Wilt thou ... live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony ... in sickness and in health; and forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as you both shall live?" And the oaths are "to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health ... till death us do part". </p><p>However, the General Synod has now given clergy the freedom to do what they like - to remain faithful to the Anglican tradition or to "bless" the new divorce culture. New guidelines from the bishops are recognized as being unworkable by the clergy who have neither the time nor the statutory powers to determine matrimonial cases fairly. The future, therefore, of the Church of England without some clear leadership will probably be a split between those who remain "traditional" and those who will embrace the modern "divorce culture" and a free-for-all. It is, of course, the duty of any Supreme Governor of the Church of England not to define doctrine but to see that the church remains "legal" and so true to its "established" doctrine as defined by Canon A5. This says:</p>
<blockquote><div>The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Scripture</strong></p><p>So what does the Bible teach about divorce and remarriage? And what did the earliest Christians in the Apostolic age remember about Jesus' teaching on divorce and remarriage? For a number of years the first converts were dependent on an oral tradition before the four Gospels were written. So what did the early teachers pass on as Jesus' teaching? Fortunately we know the answer from Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. This was written before any of the four Gospels and so is a particularly good tradition. 1 Corinthians 7.10 and 11 gives this as a summary of Jesus' teaching:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>To the married I give this command</em> (not I, but the Lord [i.e. Jesus]): <em>A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Jesus taught that there should be no divorce once a marriage had been contracted. However, if for some reason there had to be separation (from bed and board) there must be no remarriage. It could not be clearer. So, how did that "memory" fit in with the Gospel accounts when they came, a little later, to be written? Mark (which some think the earliest Gospel) says this in chapter 10 verses 6-12:</p>
<blockquote><div>[Jesus said], <em>at the beginning of creation God "made them male and female. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.' When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. He answered, 'Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Luke's report of Jesus on divorce and remarriage in chapter 16 verse 18 is short but similar:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>But then there is Matthew chapter 19 verses 3-12 which people argue about:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?' 'Haven't you read,' he replied, 'that at the beginning the Creator "made them male and female," and said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh"? So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.' 'Why then,' they asked, 'did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?' Jesus replied, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.' The disciples said to him, 'If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.' Jesus replied, 'Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Is Jesus here allowing remarriage? Is Matthew contradicting Mark and Luke? It would seem unlikely. The early Christians in the church in the period following the age of the Apostles did not take this as a contradiction and allowing remarriage. So what did Jesus mean? "Marital unfaithfulness", as a translation of the Greek <em>porneia</em>, may be misleading. <em>Porneia</em> is not the word for "adultery" [<em>moicheia</em>]; rather it covers a wide range of sexual misconduct. Now, the context for this questioning of Jesus was a debate among Jesus' Jewish contemporaries over divorce. Some said that divorce should only be for something serious like adultery (the School of Shammai), while others took a more liberal line (the School of Hillel). They believed that divorce could be for almost anything. If, however, Jesus was saying divorce and then remarriage was possible for adultery (as some interpret Matthew), he would be no different to all those who followed the teaching of Shammai. But the disciples seem to be taken aback at the rigour of Jesus' teaching. It is unlikely, therefore, that he is just siding with Shammai. Also, the word <em>porneia</em> is not the word used by Shammai for his exception. He used the words of Deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 1 which, in the Greek version are different - <em>aschêmon pragma</em> ['something indecent']. So it looks as though Jesus is more "rigorous" than Shammai. It, therefore, makes more sense to try to see how the gist of Matthew agrees with the gist of Mark and Luke. How could this be? </p><p>It is quite probable that the word <em>porneia</em> here means "marriage within the forbidden degrees" (i.e. marriage to a close relative, as in Leviticus 18 and English Law). There is then a "nullity" (and, if no previous marriage, a right not to <em>re</em>marry but to marry). Certainly <em>porneia</em> has that meaning in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1: "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality [<em>porneia</em>] among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has <em>his father's wife</em>." It also seems to mean that in Acts chapter 15 verses 19-21. And also the "forbidden" marriage of Herod and Herodias was the context for Jesus' questioning by the Pharisees in Matthew chapter 19. Jesus is now in Perea, Herod's territory, "the other side of the Jordan" (19 verse 1). This "marriage" was a huge scandal for the Jews. John the Baptist was beheaded for condemning its illegality. Matthew chapter 14 verses 3 and 4 say: "Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, <em>his brother Philip's wife</em>, for John had been saying to him: 'It is not lawful for you to have her.'" So in Matthew 19 Jesus is saying that in cases of such "forbidden marriages", or such <em>porneia</em>, there is a nullity requiring a separation. He is agreeing with John the Baptist. </p><p>On the other hand, some scholars say <em>porneia</em> does mean "marital unfaithfulness", but Jesus is only allowing divorce or separation, but not remarriage; and it is this saying that gives rise to that memory recalled in 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 10 - namely "a wife must not separate from her husband. <em>But if she does</em>, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife." Jesus' followers knew, including Matthew, that Jesus allowed for separation when there was, say, some form of sexual violence or other sexual sin. But this Matthean exception qualifies only divorce, for the phrase "except for marital unfaithfulness" [<em>mê epi porneia</em>] comes after "divorces his wife" and not after "marries another". Whatever the correct understanding, Matthew surely has to be interpreted in the light of Mark and Luke and not vice-versa. </p><p>But what, says someone else, about the so called Pauline exception? In 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verses 15-16 Paul writes this:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound </em>[literally, 'enslaved' - <em>dedoulôtai</em>] <em>in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</em></div></blockquote>
<p>It does not look as though Paul is saying there is freedom in this case to remarry. The freedom seems to be that the Christian partner is free not to fight at all costs to stop the non-Christian partner leaving and feeling guilty once a separation has happened. Paul's argument is not that "God allows us to remarry" but "God has called us to live in peace". Also it may be significant that the word translated "bound" is not the same word that Paul uses for the release that death brings to the marriage. Paul says later in 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 39:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>A woman is bound </em>[dedetai]<em> to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And this is the word he uses in Romans chapter 7 verses 2-3:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>by law a married woman is bound </em>[dedetai] <em>to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that the Anglican tradition is the tradition of the Bible, as our Anglican Reformers taught. But is this compatible with the Jesus we read about in the rest of the New Testament? The answer has to be, "Yes". While Jesus was most compassionate, he was also, when necessary, most strict. In the passage that follows the divorce passage in Matthew chapter 19 we read about the Rich Young Man to whom Jesus had to say: "Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor" (verse 21). The disciples seemed shocked as in the case of no remarriage. Here we read "when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, 'Who then can be saved?' Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" (verse 25).</p><p>On both the issues of money and sex Jesus showed great compassion and great friendship to those who made mistakes. He ate with the (hated) Tax Collectors - modern day fraudsters. And he went out of his way to minister to a Samaritan woman who had remarried four times and was currently cohabiting with some other man (John chapter 4). So Jesus recognized remarriages that were contracted by the state, while knowing that from God's perspective the first marriage had not been dissolved. For, as Andrew Cornes (a biblical scholar and Anglican clergyman) says, by calling remarriage adultery it shows that "in his eyes the original marriage still exists. It may have been dissolved in the eyes of the law, it may have come to end emotionally a long time ago, but the marriage still exists in God's eyes. That is why Jesus can say that remarriage is 'committing adultery <em>against her</em> [the first wife]' (Mark chapter 10 verse 11). If the first marriage was dead and gone, it would be impossible to commit adultery against one's first wife. But if the first marriage is still a reality in God's eyes despite the legal divorce, then to remarry is to commit adultery." </p><p>The issue ends up by being very simple - do we believe Jesus? The Church of England has said we ought to. For as God the Son, the Second Person of the Divine Trinity, he is our maker as well as our redeemer. He not only loves us but knows how we work best. He knows that a divorce and remarriage culture will not be for our good. But supposing we are remarried. What do we do? To conclude here is Andrew Cornes again:</p>
<blockquote><div>Christ is not asking you to say my present marriage is a disaster. We frequently get into situations which we were mistaken in getting into, and yet which God meets us in and blesses us in. So God is not saying to you that you are to regard your marriage, your second marriage, as a disaster. Rather thank him for how he has blessed you in your new wife, and in the way that he has used you together. Yes, some things are closed to you, when you are divorced and remarried. But you should not renege on your second marriage. To say, 'I shouldn't have married in the first place, therefore, I should now separate from my second wife,' is wrong. You have new commitments to your second wife. It would be adding insult to injury and committing a second evil, to repudiate a wife to whom you have made solemn vows. However, the logic of Christ's position is, first, that you need to admit your remarriage was something which at the time, had you understood Jesus' teaching, you should not have entered. Secondly, you need to admit that you have a continuing relationship with your first wife. You should not invite her to live in your marital home; but you do have, in God's eyes, a continuing relationship with her, which is a married relationship, though it cannot be expressed fully. It is therefore required of you to be reconciled to her to the extent that that is possible, in terms of forgiveness, of re-establishing communication if necessary and possible, and of fulfilling any financial responsibilities. Particularly all this is important for any children of an earlier marriage and your commitment to them. But, of course, you must, at the same time, take account of your commitment to your second wife.</div></blockquote>
<p>These things are difficult. But as Jesus said to the Rich Young Man, "with God all things are possible." And, remember, through Jesus' Cross there is forgiveness for all sin. That includes sexual and marital sin. As Jesus said to the adulterous woman in John chapter 8 verse 11: "neither do I condemn you." But he added, "Go now and leave your life of sin."</p><p><br><strong>Post Script</strong></p><p>There my dream ends. Why should not Prince Charles say something that at least fits in with all that?

                                                <p><strong>Abortion - Facts and Figures</strong></p>
<p>Part of the sexual culture which is destabilizing the family is undoubtedly the easy availability of abortion. The way abortion evolved in the twentieth century was perhaps one of the century's most evil developments. Like bombing Serbia or Kosovo in the Balkans War of 1999 from 30,000 feet, abortion can seem so anaesthetized. From that distance you do not see the cluster bombs decimate villages, destroy families and maim or scar innocent people. It is the same with abortion - or foeticide, as it should more accurately be called. The foetus is so small, the process apparently so clinical. </p><p>For many in the West at the start of the new millennium, 'the family' does not include the unborn. That is sinister. At least, however, questions are now being asked. There is now a growing confidence about voicing opposition to abortion that was not present even a few years ago. Ronnie Campbell, the Northeast Labour MP for Blyth, defied Tony Blair and the New Labour machine which marginalizes 'pro-lifers'. He publicly reported how activists tried to deselect him because of his views. Fellow MPs said that his career was at risk because he supported the then Liberal Democrat MP David Alton and his proposals to lower the legal time-limit on abortions. But he had the courage to stand up for what he believed, against the tide.</p><p>What especially concerns many, however, certainly amongst the Christian public, are the official government figures such as those highlighted by the Christian Institute. The figures available show that for married couples only 8 percent of pregnancies are aborted, while for unmarried couples the figure is 33 per cent. And abortion is not a matter of poverty. Indeed, the most prosperous areas have among the highest abortion rates, while areas of high unemployment have lower rates. </p><p>Most serious of all, out of 156,539 abortions in 1994 only 147 were carried out because the mother's life was in danger; in only 1,796 cases was there a risk that the child would be born handicapped; and in only 2 per cent of cases was there a grave risk of permanent injury to the mental or physical health of the mother. That means that <em>97 percent of all abortions are performed for 'social' reasons</em>.</p><p>The 1967 Abortion Act never said that abortion was moral. It simply said that certain abortions would not be the concern of the criminal law. Practically that legitimized abortion for millions. But how do you decide the morality of an abortion? Many people play a game of 'ethical snap'. Someone cites a case of a woman or girl in desperate poverty who wants an abortion; someone then 'snaps' that with horrific photos of dead foetuses and dismembered foetal limbs.</p><p>The pro-choice movement accuses anti-abortionists of being sentimental in the operating theatre. The pro-life movement accuses abortionists of being sentimental in the counselling room. Others say it is all a matter of motives: if the decision is made with reasonably unselfish motives, that justifies an abortion. But the Bible suggests that while bad motives make good actions morally hypocritical, good motives do not make wrong actions acceptable. Peter, no doubt, had some good motives in opposing the way of the Cross for Jesus; but Jesus saw his activity as Satanic (Mark 8:33).</p><p><br><strong>The Christian Tradition and the Bible</strong></p><p>We need to note some history. Abortion was common in ancient Greece - hence the Hippocratic Oath for doctors: 'I will not give a pessary to a woman to cause abortion.' It was also common in the Roman Empire. By the time of Christ abortion was well known and common in the ancient world.</p><p>The coming of Christ and the spread of the Christian faith brought a challenge to the practice of abortion. In the period immediately following that of the Apostles - the period of the Church Fathers - one of the distinctives that marked the Church off from the pagan world was its opposition to abortion. This was a fruit of the gospel - the extension of care to the humblest of human beings, including human foetal life. Early canon law, and subsequent pronouncements, have in general defended the foetus as 'human' or 'human on the way' and so as worthy of Christian love and protection.</p><p>More recently, however, an ethic of 'justifiable foeticide' has evolved. This, too, claims a Christian basis, namely that human life itself does not have an absolute value, only a very high one. There may therefore be occasions when life can be taken or protection withdrawn. But such a serious action has to be justified. As with the 'just war', the right to act cannot be presumed. It has to be argued for.</p><p>Most would agree that a serious threat to the actual life of the mother is a justifying reason. Some argue that some congenital deformity is a justifying reason (some would also say that this has to be such that no life outside the womb can be maintained). But these and other difficult cases are very rare. As we have seen, most abortions are for 'social' reasons. That is why the issue is a serious moral question that Christians cannot ignore. It involves the taking of innocent life.</p><p>But is it, in fact, <em>innocent</em> life? Is actual <em>human</em> life being destroyed in abortion or in embryo research? And why should conception be so important? What does the Bible say?</p><p>Exodus 21:22 refers to an injury to a pregnant woman. If she miscarries, the claims of the foetus are assessed as less than her own. But violence to the foetus is an offence. Mostly, however, the Bible speaks at a more general level. Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, 'As you do not know ... how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.' Perhaps the Revised Standard Version's translation is better: 'You do not know how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child ...' This suggests that there should be a certain agnosticism, or at least humility in our thinking about antenatal life. We are not facing a blob of tissue, but a divine mystery; something we cannot understand fully; and the womb contains not only a body but a 'spirit'.</p><p>The basic philosophical question is this: 'Whose is the history of that which is in the womb - the mother's or a separate person's?' The Psalmist had no doubt. It was <em>his</em> history. <em>He</em> was in the womb: 'For you created <em>my</em> inmost being; you knit <em>me</em> together in <em>my</em> mother's womb' (Psalm 139:13, my italics). Isaiah said much the same thing: '<em>Before I was born</em> the LORD called <em>me</em>; from my birth he has made mention of my name' (Isaiah 49:1, my italics).</p><p>Most importantly, this is also the Christian understanding from the New Testament stories of the birth of Jesus. The incarnation of the Son of God began not with his birth but with his <em>conception</em>. So we say in the Creed: '<em>He</em> was conceived ...' In so far as Jesus Christ reveals true man (as well as true God), the inescapable conclusion is that life in the womb is human from conception.</p><p><br><strong>Human in What Way?</strong></p><p>The fundamental Christian belief is in a God who gives, a God of 'grace'. He 'gave' his only Son for our sins (John 3:16). And human life is a 'gift'. When Job was bereaved he said, 'The Lord <em>gave</em> and the Lord has taken away' (Job 1:21). Human life is 'given'; it is not 'achieved'. That is important. We do not 'achieve' our humanity by reaching certain standards of performance or development.</p><p>Nonetheless, in the debate on abortion (and embryo and foetal experimentation) many assume today that the word 'human' (and so the offer of protection) is to be applied only where there are certain 'achievements'. These are in terms of physical performance or psychological or mental development. This, however, is a totalitarian road. And it can go on to exclude from the category of the 'human' also certain physical or racial 'underachievements'. So, for example, Peter Singer, the Princeton Professor of Bioethics, says that mentally retarded children can be dispensed with - he is proposing infanticide; and Hitler dispensed with millions of Jews through the terrible Holocaust of the Second World War.</p><p>If humanity is a 'gift', the first 14 days surely cannot be discounted as a period of 'nonbeing', any more than other periods of a person's life. Behind human procreation is the divine creation. Procreation is creation on behalf of God (<em>pro</em> being Latin for 'on behalf of'). Protection is to be offered to human beings not because they 'reach a certain stage of development' but because of the fact that they are all created by God <em>in his image</em>. 'Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man' (Genesis 9:6).</p><p>So what are we saying if we say the foetus is 'human'? We are saying that in virtue of its genotype or genetic code it is a distinct being that has been <em>pro</em>created. It may be that God's creative powers, entrusted to men and women, have been misused, but that is not a ground for destroying what has been created. And what is created is a human foetus. It is not a human infant, nor a human adolescent, nor a human adult, nor a senile human being. If a senile person is a degenerating member of humanity, a foetus is a developing member. The boundaries of humanity are death and conception.<br>The foetus is not simply 'potentially' human either. Yes, the foetus only potentially has the characteristics it will develop in later life. The new born baby only potentially has the characteristics it will develop as a toddler or teenager. But a foetus is more accurately 'a human with potential'. An ovum or sperm - i.e. prior to conception - is 'potentially human'.</p><p>We should also not moralize, like bomber pilots, according to size. An embryo may look, and actually be, tiny. A village looks microscopic from 30,000 feet. So it may not <em>feel</em> so bad dropping bombs from that distance, but innocent people are killed nonetheless.</p><p>There are many other problems to consider, including the guilt felt by those who have had abortions. The Church, therefore, must not only teach what is right. It must teach also that the good news is about forgiveness at the Cross of Calvary, where Christ bore the sins of the world, including the sin of abortion and the sins of others that lead to abortion. Some reading this may be scarred by having had, or being involved in, an abortion. The gospel is that Christ loves the sinner and forgives, but he hates the sin and always says: 'Go and sin no more.' That is on the pastoral level.</p><p>There is also, however, the political level. We have to remember that the health of a nation is not just measured by the growth of its economy, the rate of its inflation, its budget deficit, or its prestige buildings. There are other more important measurements.</p><p>You can measure a nation's health by how many families are broken, how many children are suffering because of those breakdowns, the attitude to the sanctity of human life, and whether the vulnerable, the innocent and the unborn are being protected. On all those counts - especially the last one - Britain would seem to be sick. Since the 1967 Abortion Act in Britain we have lost 5 million lives through abortion - one in every five pregnancies. But the real evil, in the words of David Alton, is that 'in the short space of 30 years, a serious crime has become a right; a public question of law and ethics has become a personal choice; and a practice once firmly repudiated by the medical profession has become a tragic, routine medical procedure - so routine that clinics offer a lunch-box service.'</p><p>In the Church and the State there is a need to have a consciousness with regard to the facts, and then a conscience over this State-sponsored killing which is a daily occurrence.</p><p><br><strong>Raymond Johnston</strong></p><p>The above is an extract from a chapter in my book <em>Church and State in the New Millennium</em>, London, HarperCollins, 2000, pp. 145-151. Let me now extract something else. Last year I had to write up a lecture I had given on the life of Raymond Johnston and it was published as <em>A call for Christian thinking and action</em>, Newcastle, Christian Institute, 2004. Raymond was churchwarden at Jesmond Parish Church when I arrived in 1973. He was lecturing at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne but then left to be the first director of the Nationwide Festival of Light which he transformed into CARE - (whose initials stand for "Christian Action Research and Education"). Sadly he died relatively young in 1985. </p><p>In the booklet I included Raymond's views on abortion (pp. 12-14). It may be helpful to include them here as well. So the following is what I wrote. I began by saying that because Raymond Johnston was a "Reformation man", he saw no dichotomy between his Christian faith and social concern. </p><p>The doctrine of the Sovereignty of God means that God is concerned for the whole of life, not just life on Sundays in church but Monday to Saturday out in the world as well. Raymond believed that God was creator as well as redeemer; and he believed this created world couldn't be neglected even though our attitude towards it must always be in the light of heaven and eternity. He believed that God had created man in his own image, and that although that image was distorted by sin, it hadn't been destroyed. He, therefore, believed in the sanctity of human life. Believing also that "the archetypal transgression was murder" as evidenced in the sin of Cain, he naturally campaigned against attacks on human life. And the great attack since 1967 he saw coming through abortion, that huge blot on the moral landscape.</p><p>Let me give you Raymond's reasoning on this subject in some detail as it is still something to be fought and campaigned against. I quote:</p>
<blockquote><div>The question that is raised is: is it, or is it not, murder? It is true that the Bible never mentions deliberate induced abortion, so there is no explicit ruling on the matter. Nevertheless, by the end of the first century, one of the Christian ethical distinctives was already that Christians did not practise abortion. The <em>Didache</em>, an early manual of moral teaching and guide to conduct, was probably written before some of the latest epistles in the New Testament: it is against abortion. A prohibition against abortion was among the … canons of the Council of Elvira (c AD 306).By the end of the second century, the influence of Christianity had brought Roman law to forbid abortion, long before the conversion of Constantine and the Christianizing of the Roman Empire. Long before that, under the Emperor Severus, Roman law forbade abortion. This was the influence of Christianity over a hundred and fifty years. And the medical profession has never wavered over the last two thousand years – until our own lifetime … In Britain, for centuries a pregnant woman convicted of a capital offence could not be hanged – because she was bearing another life …The key question [then] is this: is the unborn child (for me as a Christian and equally as a member of the human race) entitled to my brotherly, neighbourly protection? Is it entitled to the same protection I would seek to give to a person I saw being attacked in the street? Is the unborn child my neighbour – or not?</div></blockquote>
<p>Raymond Johnston offers five considerations to help us answer that question.</p>
<blockquote><div>First, <em>ignorance points only one way</em>. If our answer is 'I do not know', or if I hold that there must be a point between conception and childbirth when the child becomes worthy of my protection but that I do not know when that point is – in either of these cases of ignorance, it must follow that we have to protect the child from the moment of conception onwards, because you could not accept ignorance as a morally valid defence in any comparable case.Consider the case of a man lying in the street, having been run over or knocked down. You would not say, 'I wonder if he is dead or not? I do not know. So I'll leave him, I won't try to save his life, I won't even call the ambulance.' On the contrary, you would say that because you did not know, you would go straight to that man's aid and help him as much as you could … [similarly] I begin my protection of that child from the moment of conception, simply because I do not know, and because otherwise I could be making a terrible mistake.Secondly, <em>human life is genetically complete at conception</em>.Admittedly, at the beginning you did not look much like a human being, though we now know that after a few weeks in the womb, you did. In any case, the fact that a person does not look like a human being is not an argument for not protecting him. If you are a doctor called to a major disaster, you do not discuss whether somebody looks enough like a human being before being treated. You just give the treatment …Thirdly, no criterion of 'full humanity' will justify induced abortion. <em>There is no point at which you can say that you are fully human …</em>Fourthly, <em>human life is a continuum in which birth is only one event</em>. What is natural birth today could have been induced childbirth yesterday … Indeed, the baby born by natural birth today could have been delivered by caesarean section a month ago …Fifthly, <em>the teaching of Scripture</em>. When we look to the Bible for guidance on this subject we find that the biblical writers are conscious of God's hand upon them long before birth. Think of the birth stories that go back long before conception: how many individuals – such as Samuel, Samson, Jacob and Esau and Jeremiah – were either called by God, or were spoken of in advance, long before the moment of their natural birth. This does not make the case unanswerable, but it is an important factor …But what <em>does</em>, in my opinion, conclusively resolve the issue is the use of the Greek word <em>brephos</em> in Luke 1.41. It means 'the child'. 'The child leaped in her womb' – it is the same word as is used for a child <em>after birth. And, more than leaping in her womb, the child apparently was filled with the Holy Spirit. Elizabeth spoke of the pregnant Mary as the 'mother of my Lord'.This brings us therefore to the Christian affirmation of the incarnation, which leaves us no room for escape at all. If you are an orthodox, well-taught Christian who is asked, 'When did God become man?' you will respond with the Apostles' Creed: 'conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary'. That is when he became man [at conception].But if that is true, then manhood [or human existence] begins at conception. And if the proper man – that is, Jesus – began his earthly existence as a human being at conception, then so do all human beings. It is inescapable.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Raymond's desperate concern over abortion was ultimately from his understanding that God has created men and women in his own image.</p><p><br><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>I quoted earlier that in 1994 there were 156,539 abortions. The latest figures are for 2003 and there were 181,582 abortions. And now not one in five but one in three pregnacies end in abortion. Things are getting worse. We are now reverting to the Greco-Roman pre-Christian ethic. The Greek philosopher Plato would have abortions mandatory for all women conceiving over forty and Aristotle was not much better. But once the Christian gospel had taken root, immediately there was change. Raymond Johnston mentioned the <em>Didache</em>. It is blunt: 'Thou shalt not murder a child by abortion nor kill them when born.' May we follow in that Christian tradition.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Politics, HIV/AIDs, Education, and the General Election 2005">(May 2005) Politics, HIV/AIDs, Education, and the General Election 2005</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2005</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Starting Point and William Temple</strong></p><p>After "Godly Living" and "Church Growth" the third part of our <em>vision statement</em> is "Changing Britain". But how is a Christian to "change Britain"? Paul's letter to the Romans, and especially chapter 13, is where you can start. William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury who died towards the end of the Second World War, wrote an important book in 1942 entitled <em>Christianity and the Social Order</em>. This took seriously that biblical tradition. Temple was adamant, therefore, that any political doctrine had to acknowledge the reality of sin. It was in this book that he gave a famous definition of sin:</p>
<blockquote><div>I am the centre of the world I see; where the horizon is depends on where I stand ... But I am not the centre of the world, or the standard of reference as between good and bad; I am not and God is. In other words, from the beginning I put myself in God's place. This is my original sin ... Education may make my self-centredness less disastrous by widening my horizon of interest; so far it is like the climbing of a tower, which widens the horizon for physical vision while leaving me still the centre and standard of reference.</div></blockquote>
<p>Statesmen have to deal with self-centred men and women who are sinners; and statesmen fundamentally have to provide security. The first priority of government, according to Temple, is not so much love or justice, but "some reasonable measure of security against murder, robbery and starvation." Therefore, we should be more interested in achievements than promises. A political programme can promise a great deal; but if it cannot deliver the basic necessities of life, it is useless. So he concluded: "Its assertion of original sin should make the Church intensely realistic and conspicuously free from Utopianism." It was for this reason that Temple never forgot the priority of evangelism: "If we have to choose between making men Christian and making the social order more Christian, we must choose the former." Also it was for this reason he believed the State only had a <em>limited</em> public function; and it needed to be kept that way. So he asserted three basics about the state: "One, society is more than the State, and has a life which is largely independent of the State; two, social progress largely consists of the expression and development of that independence; three, the State is distinguished from other 'social cohesions' by the fact that it alone is entitled to use force in order to secure obedience to its command."</p><p>Temple endorsed the view that the Public Square is not to be identified with Parliament Square. But while agreeing "that the task of the Church in the face of social problems is to make good Christian men and women," he realized that in a democratic society each person has a responsibility as a citizen to exercise political influence. Each person is part of those "governing authorities ... established by God" (Romans 13.1) and so responsible for justice and order. Most, of course, do not want to be heavily involved in politics (though, it needs to be said, currently we need more Christians to be elected to local and central government and then willing, when necessary, to act as a minority of one). But all Christians should be sufficiently informed of issues and of the key political players every five years or so. They can then register their support or protest by a cross on a voting paper; and that five-yearly vote has enormous influence. To be "sufficiently informed", Temple argued, the Church - its clergy and teachers - must provide Christian men and women "with a systematic statement of principles to aid them in doing these two things [i.e. living positively for Jesus Christ in the world and, then, voting responsibly], and this will carry with it a denunciation of customs or institutions in contemporary life and practice which offend against those principles."</p><p><br><strong>Ends and Means</strong></p><p>Temple believed that the Church (as such) was also limited. It was to focus on "those principles". This, he said, meant the Church was, first, to concern itself with ends, not means; and, secondly, to oppose means that were not achieving the prescribed ends or were self-evidently evil. He used an analogy:</p>
<blockquote><div>If a bridge is to be built, the Church may remind the engineer that it is his obligation to provide a really safe bridge; but it is not entitled to tell him whether, in fact, his design meets this requirement ... in just the same way the Church may tell the politician what ends the social order should promote; but it must leave to the politician the devising of the precise means to those ends.</div></blockquote>
<p>The three ends that Temple advocated for a Christian social order were "freedom, fellowship and service". These were derived from the "fundamental Christian postulates that man is a child of God and is destined for a life of eternal fellowship with him." Service, he believed, was so important. He was saddened that the French writer Rousseau, during the eighteenth century French Revolution, and Marx, during the nineteenth century economic revolution, had "taught the democratic movement to take its stand on rights." But there is only one safe way to true social progress, he claimed. That is not to be found in rights but duties. Initially there may be little observable difference in a system that majors on rights from a system that majors on duties. Duties are the other side of the coin to rights. For example, what is a duty for one man, namely that he observes a no-parking sign, is another man's right, namely that his drive-way is not obstructed. "But the difference in the temper of the movement that rests on rights will be aggressive, violent, contentious; and the temper of a movement that rests on duties will be persuasive, public spirited, harmonious."</p><p>What, however, of the first two of Temple's trio of ends, "freedom and fellowship"? It can reasonably be argued that "the right" majors on freedom, while "the left" on fellowship. The right seeks to restore the balance when the collective state ignores or frustrates personal opportunity and initiative; the left seeks to prevent personal freedoms unfairly frustrating the collective good. Then again the right seems more concerned to fulfil the biblical mandate of "being fruitful and replenishing the earth". It is concerned with wealth creation. The left seems more concerned with the biblical command to secure justice for the poor and oppressed and a fair distribution of the wealth that has been created. The dangers respectively are that the right, in its proper concern for wealth creation, ignores certain injustices; and the left, in its proper concern for justice and distribution, can forget wealth creation - so before long there can be general "want".</p><p><br><strong>Principles, their Application and HIV/AIDS</strong></p><p>In all of this we have to think clearly, and not least when we use the word "biblical". With the growth of evangelicalism it is now fashionable to claim as "biblical" all sorts of policies. Sometimes that means little more than someone has started with a biblical principle. They then, however, make claims about "means" by making deductions based not on the Bible but on human experience and observation. Their final conclusion is then said to be "biblical". </p><p>Surely this is misleading. Let me explain why, in simple terms using a <br>classical syllogism (or formal argument). Kenneth Myers puts it well in his essay, <em>Biblical Obedience and Political Thought</em>:</p>
<blockquote><div>If the major premise of my argument is drawn from Scripture (e.g., God hates injustice), but the minor premise is based on empirical analysis (e.g., capitalism is unjust), I cannot assert that the conclusion (e.g., God hates capitalism) is simply the teaching of the Word of God. I <em>can</em> say that God hates injustice and that, in my judgment, capitalism is unjust. But the truth of the minor premise is not determined either by the truth of the major premise or by the validity of the argument. Continually repeating the major premise with prophetic fervour will not demonstrate the truth of the minor premise. Only sustained examination of the facts and argumentation from them can do that.</div></blockquote>
<p>Much of politics should be "a sustained examination of the facts". And not only Christians want this. But Christians are often more open to facts and more honest. Take the debate on HIV/AIDS and condoms. </p><p>Roman Catholics are regularly damned for their policy on this issue, not least as regards the developing world. The Church of England disagrees with their forbidding the use of condoms for married couples. But epidemiologically Roman Catholics may be more right than wrong with regard to HIV/AIDS. On current evidence it is likely that widespread condom campaigns will <em>increase the spread of AIDS. What is needed, as they argue, are campaigns for abstinence before marriage and faithfulness within marriage. Uganda has had some success with such campaigns.</em></p><p><em>The hard facts that are not being faced are these: users of the condom as a contraceptive have a "typical use" failure rate in preventing contraception of 15% per year (according to the 2004 edition of <em>Contraceptive Technology</em>). True, the "perfect use" failure rate is 2%; but most people are not "perfect users". So in any given year we must predict that 15% of most women who rely on condoms for contraception will conceive. However, we know that women are fertile for only a small proportion of any given month. Therefore, the failure rate of the condom as a prophylactic against HIV/AIDS could be considerably higher than 15% for most people (not, of course, for the "perfect users"). All this should be warning enough. But "Utopian" politicians and health-workers are refusing to face other and more significant hard facts. We now have the research of Professor David Paton with regard to adolescent behaviour. He argues that "measures aimed at cutting teenage pregnancy and sexual disease among teenagers, such as making condoms more widely available, have had the opposite effect" (to quote the summary from the Journal, April 2004). All this, of course, is "on average". His own words in the conclusion to his paper on <em>Random Behaviour or Rational Choice</em> are:</em></p>
<blockquote><div>It is not enough to introduce a measure aimed at a specific outcome without considering the endogenous response of agents to the policy itself. In the case in question, it appears that some measures aimed at reducing adolescent pregnancy rates induced changes in teenage behaviour that were large enough not only to negate the intended impact on pregnancy rates but to have an adverse impact on another important area of adolescent sexual health - sexually transmitted infections.</div></blockquote>
<p>The point is this: some "measures" lessen some dangers when "perfectly" followed, once there is a decision to engage in sexual activity. But the measures themselves <em>increase</em> the amount of sexual activity. The result then is that the overall health outcome is not what was intended, rather the reverse.</p><p><br><strong>The Denial of Christian Principles and Education</strong></p><p>The fight against AIDS raises another important question for the Christian in regard to politics. As we have seen, we must be careful about calling all policies "biblical" simply because we start from biblical principles. However, where a policy directly contradicts a biblical principle, the political response of the believer is crystal clear. It is to affirm the principle as a non-negotiable policy and vote or lobby accordingly. </p><p>Take a proposal, whether overtly or covertly, to outlaw legitimate evangelism. Indeed, it seemed that the recent "religious hatred clauses" debated in Parliament could have resulted (covertly) in such a law. So Christians sided with those opposing the clauses. Today there is an assault on the Christian faith in Europe. Sadly that means there are more and more cases where a biblical principle is directly being attacked in Parliament. It then is not just a matter of having a fair debate over the application of a principle and where Christians can be on different sides. This is fighting for a principle. William Temple seemed to see these distinctions very clearly. </p><p>One of the areas where he personally saw the application of biblical principles&nbsp;as being important was education. Indeed, he was one of the behind-the-scenes architects of the 1944 Education Act. So Temple concluded his little book <em>Christianity and the Social Order</em> with his own views on Education. But he was clear: this was "application". So he distinguished what he had said earlier in the book, and which he believed was a fair statement of Christian political theory, from what he was now saying. He realized that not everyone in the Church would necessarily agree with him over education (in the event, however, the majority in the Church and country did). Similarly, speaking personally but from a local perspective, I, too, want to talk about education. </p><p>In 2001 I convened a local group of pastors and clergy to discuss the educational needs of the West of the city. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills was at that time inviting clergy, in particular, to sponsor new City Academies. So the group agreed that we should explore the possibility of such an academy for the West of the City. The DfES gave us encouragement; but we received, and have received, opposition locally from both the former Labour controlled Newcastle Council and now the Liberal Democrat controlled Newcastle Council. We believe something must be done. In terms of 5 A*-C's GCSE's, Gateshead LEA is 10th out of 150 LEA's in the country. Newcastle LEA, however, is 113th out of 150 LEA's. Newcastle West schools are, respectively, 3159th, 3421st, 3542nd out of 3579 state secondary schools in England. The children deserve better.</p><p>The latest twist in the saga is that Clive Harding, the senior Pastor at Bethshan Christian Centre, is standing as a Parliamentary Candidate for the new Newcastle Academy With Christian Values Party (NAWCVP) in this Election. You can be "sufficiently informed" about the other parties by reference to the Christian Institute's Election Briefing (www.christian.org.uk). But this does not include details about NAWCVP (www.nawcvp.co.uk) which is a single issue party. The Party shares the beliefs and aims of the Sponsoring Group and "fully endorses the statement of ethos of the Sponsoring Group". Subject to minor modification these were all documented in a previous <em>Coloured Supplement</em> for January 2001. But let me repeat them again.</p><p><br><strong>The Newcastle Academy With Christian Values Party (NAWCVP)</strong></p><p>The NAWCVP believes that a Newcastle Academy with Christian values will be a catalyst for growth and development for some of the most disadvantaged members of the North East community. It believes that an Academy run to the standards and <br>with the ethos that the Sponsoring Group propose will bring renewed confidence to the area and in turn produce significant social and economic regeneration. The NAWCVP believes there must be a general improvement in secondary level education. Particularly it wishes to see, <em>one</em>, greater diversity and choice in education; <em>two</em>, a raising of standards of achievement among 11-14 year-olds; <em>three</em>, vocational concerns and more flexibility in the national curriculum; and, <em>four</em>, greater managerial freedom with the employment of sponsors from the business world.</p><p>The NAWCVP believes the proposed Newcastle Academy with Christian values would be a partner school in the family of schools of Newcastle upon Tyne, ready to share what the school will be doing with others and equally desirous to learn from others. The NAWCVP believes that the Academy would offer a VIth Form with a realistic range of courses and so provide a pathway for those who want it and need it to higher education. The NAWCVP believes that the Sponsoring Group would produce an Academy better than any alternative as it would draw on the help of people with a proven track record for some of the best Academies in the country. The NAWCVP believes that the Sponsoring Group would ensure an Academy that is committed to working for high standards of work and behaviour and wants to see high academic standards from children including those who face challenges in their educational development.</p><p>The NAWCVP knows there are business professionals who strongly support a Newcastle Academy with Christian values. These professionals see that the project will play a significant part in helping the revitalization of the North East. The NAWCVP supports the proposal for the Academy to have as its specialism business and enterprise and an imaginative language programme that could involve languages such as Cantonese, other Asian languages and Latin as well as modern European languages. The NAWCVP also supports the concern of the Sponsoring Group to see excellence in sport and also the creative arts, including music and film/radio/TV production. The NAWCVP is confident that the concern for all subjects, both in the arts and sciences, will in no way be lessened by the specialisms. It believes they will all to be taught to the same high level.</p><p><br><strong>Ethos</strong></p><p>The NAWCVP fully endorses the statement of ethos of the Sponsoring Group who say:</p><p>1. We are a Christian group with a mainstream, historic, biblical Christian ethos. We are leaders of some of the largest churches in the city from a range of denominations - Anglican, Baptist and Pentecostal as well as the new and growing Chinese Church. But we are emphatically "non-denominational".</p><p>2. We are committed to an inclusive policy of "open" admissions. No tests will be applied to any parent or teacher who is willing to accept the ethos of the school. We, therefore, expect parents from other religious traditions or none to want to enrol their children. Such, we believe, will be the success and excellence of the school.</p><p>3. We will also hold a daily act of worship in accordance with the Education Reform Act 1988 and our religious education will, of course, involve the teaching of Christianity but also teaching about other world religions and non-religious philosophies. </p><p>4. We will be concerned to help children be clear on moral issues and we will expect pupils to finish their school careers being able clearly to distinguish right from wrong. </p><p>5. Our sex education will be premised on the view that two married parents committed together for life are in the best interests of the children while recognizing the need for the support of children from disrupted families and all the pressures that young people are under today.</p><p>6. Our ethos will seek to produce "good citizens". This will come through our training for public life. It will also come from our clear discipline but exercised in a secure and caring environment. </p><p>7. We see every human being as unique and of value in the sight of God from whatever background or environment. We will, therefore, seek to address the needs of every individual pupil. With those with potential or actual learning difficulties we will develop a strategy to raise their attainments.</p><p>8. We will seek to develop firm links with the business community in order to enhance the employment and life opportunities for our pupils.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Baptism and Infant Baptism">(June 2005) Baptism and Infant Baptism</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2005</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li><li>faith</li><li>covenant</li><li>repentance</li></ul>
                                                <p>At the end of his sermon on the day of Pentecost - the day some have called the "birthday" of the Church - the apostle Peter said this:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off - for all whom the Lord our God will call." </em>(Acts 2.38).</div></blockquote>
<p>That tells us five things, right at the start of the Church's life. <em>First</em>, baptism was an action relating to "the promise" God made originally to the Jews ("you and your children") but ultimately to the whole Gentile world ("all who are far off"). <em>Secondly</em>, it was an action relating to the "forgiveness of ... sins" and "the gift of the Holy Spirit". <em>Thirdly</em>, people needed to "repent" as a condition of being baptized. <em>Fourthly</em>, it was "in the name of Jesus Christ" - it meant a new commitment to Jesus Christ and his lordship. And, <em>fifthly</em>, everything depended on God's call - the promise was "for all whom the Lord our God will call."</p><p><br><strong>The Promise</strong></p><p>"The promise" referred to here needs to be understood in the context of the whole movement of God towards men and women that you read about in the Old Testament. This movement involved what the Bible calls God's "covenant". A covenant promised benefits and blessings; but it also carried some obligations. In the Old Testament (and in the New Testament) the covenant God made with Abraham was of great importance as God called Abraham to be the head of his special people - in the first instance the Jews (Genesis 17). As time went on the prophets made it clear that the promise of the covenant was a promise of eternal rather than temporal benefits and blessings, and that Abraham's "children" would come from all over the world as they were called by God (Isaiah 49). Then Jeremiah and Ezekiel spoke of God's promise of a renewed covenant whose main characteristic would be the giving of the Holy Spirit in a new way. It was this new covenant between God and those he calls to be his people that Jesus inaugurated by his death on the Cross:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" </em>(Matthew 26.28).</div></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes in the Old Testament God's promise to his people went along with a required ritual action. This action was as much God given as his promise. And like the signing and sealing of a document today, it was both an act of mutual commitment and a reminder (if necessary) of what had been promised and accepted. So on the day of Pentecost, Peter was saying that the promise of the new covenant had been fulfilled. The Holy Spirit had come in a new way. But his Jewish hearers needed to trust this promise and be baptized as a ritual act to show that they did trust it. Nor was this totally unlike what had happened to Abraham. Abraham (and his sons) were commanded to have "circumcision" as a ritual act. God said:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you" </em>(Genesis 17.11).</div></blockquote>
<p>The difference, of course, is that baptism was and is for everyone - men and women - not just for men (as circumcision was), and not just for Abraham's natural descendents but for people of every race and nation ("for all who are far off - for all whom the Lord our God will call"). But baptism certainly looks like God's guarantee of the benefits and blessings of the new covenant as circumcision was of the old. As Article XXVII of the <em>Thirty-nine</em> puts it: by baptism "the promises of the forgiveness of sins, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed." </p><p><br><strong>The Great Commission</strong></p><p>But why did Peter demand baptism? The answer is that just a few days before Pentecost Jesus himself had given his disciples these instructions as "marching orders" for the church:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" </em>(Matthew 28.19-20)</div></blockquote>
<p>The disciples, of course, were familiar with baptism through the ministry of John the Baptist. He used baptism as a ritual act in his call to repentance. Even Jesus had made use of baptism in the early stages of his ministry (John 4.1). There were also, it seems, ritual "baptisms" among the various groups of Jews, certainly for the admission of Gentile proselytes (or converts); and for these Jews baptism was always connected with cleansing from moral defilement - it was "for the forgiveness of sins". </p><p>The distinctive thing about John, therefore, was not his ritual. The distinctive thing was his calling to repentance and baptism not just Gentiles who were converting to Judaism but Jews themselves - those who could say: "we have Abraham as our father" (Luke 3.8). He was saying that the Jews were really no better than the Gentiles. </p><p>Christian baptism (post Pentecost), however, was distinctive from John's <em>and</em> Jewish baptism in that it was not just a ritual for repentance but a ritual that says the new covenant age of the Spirit had (and has) dawned. It was (and is) a baptism relating to "the gift of the Holy Spirit". John had said: "I baptize you with water, but he [Jesus] will baptize you with the Holy Spirit" (Mark 1.8).</p><p><br><strong>Were Infants Baptized in New Testament Times?</strong></p><p>Who were baptized on the day of Pentecost? We are told (Acts 2.41):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Did that three thousand include "women and children"? Sometimes in New Testament times when there was a higher total, the numbering was of men only. This happened in Jesus' miraculous feeding of the five thousand:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children</em> (Matthew 14.21).</div></blockquote>
<p>So did the three thousand include men <em>and women</em> but not children? Or did they include men, women <em>and children</em>? There is no reason to assume that women and children were not present for Peter's Pentecost sermon. We know that the core group of believers that met after the Ascension in the "upstairs ... room" included women as well as the eleven apostles (Acts 1.13-14). If some of these women were wives of the apostles (cf 1 Cor 9.5), it is likely there were some babies or children present as well. </p><p>We don't know whether the group of believers "numbering about a hundred and twenty" (Acts 1.15) before Pentecost was, or was not, a hundred and twenty "besides women and children." Similarly we don't know whether the three thousand "God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven" (Acts 2.5), who were converted that Pentecost, included women and children. It is, however, extremely unlikely that women and (their) children were not present as Peter preached at this festival time. </p><p>Jews took infants and very young children to their religious events. In the Old Testament immediately after Samuel's birth, Elkanah (his father) "went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord" at Shiloh. Elkanah was expecting Hannah and the baby to come as part of this family visit. But on this occasion she perferred to keep the baby at home until he was weaned (1 Samuel 1.21-23). In the New Testament when Paul left Tyre, Luke tells us that ...<em>"... all the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray"</em> (Acts 21.5).</p>
<p>The New Testament tells us very little about children. Yes, Jesus had a great concern for children, and, compared with the pagan world of the first and subsequent centuries, the early church had enormous respect for children from conception to adulthood. Nevertheless, the early church was not like today in being so child-centred. Rather, as in Old Testament times, the early church saw children as truly dependent on their parents, spiritually as well as materially. They were uniquely embedded in their families. The spiritual status of their parents, or even of one believing parent, became the child's spiritual status. On the day of Pentecost babies and very young children present could well have been considered to be sharing in their parents "repentance" and so have qualified for baptism.</p><p><br><strong>1 Corinthians 7.14</strong></p><p>In 1 Corinthians 7.14 Paul says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Using the language of "covenant" this verse says that children of believers are within the new covenant. </p><p>As D.W.B.Robinson comments:</p>
<blockquote><div>holy' here does not refer to moral attainment; it is rather a term applied to those who are members of the 'people of God', whose status, given by God, is one of 'holiness', which means set apart by God for himself ... Thus the children of those who belong to the 'people of God' are likewise reckoned to be members.</div></blockquote>
<p>And W.A. Strange says:</p>
<blockquote><div>Paul states this [children being 'holy'] not as a problem, but as an established and agreed point ... It seems to be a matter of family solidarity that one parent being 'holy' (a Christian) affects the status of the children, and even the status of the other spouse ... This verse is a difficult one for the modern reader. But the point for our purposes is that Paul counts the children as in the community of faith, not out of it.</div></blockquote>
<p>So Paul considers the children of believers at Corinth exactly as he considers the whole church at Corinth. Here is his opening address to the Corinthians:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ - their Lord and ours</em> (1 Cor 1.2)</div></blockquote>
<p>But how did the believing wife or husband know that their children were "holy"? How was this an established and agreed point in the way that it wasn't an established and agreed point with regard to the unbelieving partner? There has to be something objective to which appeal could be made. In the light of subsequent history, the baptism of the believing partner <em>along with her (or his) child or children</em> is the most plausible suggestion. That, of course, would mean that infant baptism was a practice of the apostolic church. It would also mean that when you read of "household baptisms" in the New Testament (as with Cornelius, Acts 10.24,48; Lydia, Acts 16.15; the Philippian gaoler, Acts 16.33; and Stephanas, 1 Cor 1.16) children, if in the family, were included in those "households". </p><p>For sixteen centuries the church, almost universally, seemed to believe that children, indeed infants, were included in households and were baptised in the<br>apostolic period. But at the Reformation a minority group of radical Reformers, the Anabaptists, challenged that received wisdom, while in the 20th century there were also a considerable number who expressed doubts. </p><p>The main reason for doubting is simply that there is no overt statement in the New Testament to the fact that infants were included in the "households". The subordinate reason for doubting is a belief that conscious repentance in the case of everyone is necessary for admission to baptism. That would exclude all babies and young children. But if we discover that as a matter of fact the apostles baptized the babies and young children of Christian households, that belief will have to be revised. 1 Corinthians 7.14 suggests the simplest starting point.</p><p><br><strong>No Overt Statements</strong></p><p>To address these doubts, first another question: how do we know whether women were baptized in those household baptisms? The answer is: "only because of one text and one woman." We are told that Lydia was baptised in Acts 16.15. Had we not been told in that one verse, we could have been doubtful about women's baptism in the church in the age of the apostles. We know that there were distinctions made in the early church between men and women. Without that one text could we not have wondered if baptism was for "men only", like circumcision?</p><p>Neither Mark, Luke or John tell us about the "women and children" at the feeding of the five thousand. Unless Matthew had filled us in, we would never have known that "women and children" were also present. And no one has told us plainly whether or not children or infants were suitable candidates for baptism. Had they done so "an enormous quantity of ink could have been saved, and the church could have been spared a divisive and troublesome controversy ... It was not of any consequence to Luke or Paul to tell their readers whether these households had any children, and if so, whether they were included or excluded when the other members were baptized" (W.A.Strange). </p><p>So how do we go about trying to solve this problem about the facts?</p><p><em>First</em>, it is worth noting that Paul not only hasn't filled us in with all the details we want in the 21st century, he also himself did not seem to have baptism in theory or baptisms in practice or who did, or did not, do the baptizing at the top of his consciousness. His was a somewhat relaxed attitude. It is hard to see, therefore, these disputes as being of primary matters of doctrine. In 1 Corinthians 1.14 he says this:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius ... Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else</em> (1 Corinthians 1.14,16)</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, it is also worth noting that there is one small piece of evidence in John 4.49 regarding the profile of New Testament "households". When John tells us about Jesus healing an "official's son", we are told that the son was not just a <em>pais</em> (Greek for a "child") but a <em>paidion</em> (Greek for a "very young child"). "Servants" are, then, mentioned reporting the goodnews of the miracle. And in verse 53 we read:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>so he </em>[the official]<em> and all his household believed".</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Common sense says, exegeting "scripture in the light of scripture", it looks as though a household would include men, women, very young children and servants. So if this incident had been post-Pentecost, the very young child and the servants might have been baptized as being in the "household". We must note also that the "very young child" experienced the benefits of his father's faith and not his own. It was his father's faith that led to the miracle of the child's healing.</p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, there is evidence that children of Jewish proselytes were "baptized" along with their parents at the time of Jesus. If this was common practice, we may assume that John the Baptist baptized very young children or babies (as occasion required) along with their mothers (and fathers). If this was common practice that is why we are not told about it in the case of John. It was not a distinctive. What was distinctive was John's calling Jews to repentance and not just Gentiles. And if this was common practice in Jewish baptisms perhaps that is also why the fact of children in household baptisms was not mentioned in the texts. The New Testament writers thought there was no need to spell it out that children were included, as most readers assumed they were.</p><p><em>Fourthly</em>, there is no single piece of evidence in the New Testament of a child being brought up as a Christian and baptised at a later age. As Anthony Lane says:</p>
<blockquote><div>If the problem with infant baptism is <em>inconclusive</em> evidence that it happened in the [early] church, the problem with the alternative theory [dedication with later baptism] is <em>total lack</em> of evidence. It is true that the New Testament evidence for the baptism of infants is inconclusive, but at least there are passages which may plausibly be interpreted as implying that infants were baptised - such as Acts 16.33. By contrast there is no evidence at all for the later baptism of Christian children. There is no record of such a baptism and no hint in the epistles that such children should be seeking baptism ... It is noteworthy that in the New Testament epistles the instruction given to the churches includes instruction to children (Eph 6.1-4; Col. 3.20). These children, [however], are not encouraged or instructed to be baptised, nor are their parents instructed to work to that end. Instead, the children are addressed as Christians, which fits best with the theory that they are baptised.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Around the Year 200 AD</strong></p><p><em>Fifthly</em>, along with the argument from 1 Corinthians 7.14 (about "holy" children), the most significant argument relates to the period when we can be certain about what happened. We can then work backwards - from the definite to the less definite. </p><p>Around the year 200 AD there is clear evidence for the baptism of infants or children. Before that we have no <em>definite</em> information one way or the other about infant baptism. But in this period there were Hippolytus at Rome, Tertullian at Carthage, Cyprian (also) at Carthage, Origen in Alexandria and inscriptions on Christian tombstones. All are unequivocal. All make it clear that babies and little children were being baptized at this time. </p><p>However, there is no evidence that baptizing infants was a recent innovation. Rather, the evidence goes the other way, namely that this was an established practice and, most definitely, an established practice that some of the early church fathers much regretted! Tertullian (165-225), for example, in his work <em>On Baptism</em> urges that baptism should be delayed:</p>
<blockquote><div> ... deferment of baptism is more profitable, in accordance with each person's character and attitude, and even age: and especially so as regards children. For what need is there, if there really is no need, for even their sponsors to be brought into peril, seeing that they may possibly themselves fail of their promises by death, or be deceived by the subsequent development of an evil disposition? ... So let them come when they are growing up, when they are learning, when they are being taught what they are coming to; let them be made Christians when they have become competent to know Christ. Why should innocent infancy come with haste to the remission of sins?</div></blockquote>
<p>Tertullian's problem is that of "post-baptismal" sin. Tertullian was holding to the non-biblical idea that sin after baptism could not be forgiven. Therefore, postpone baptism, he taught, until much later. He never, however, opposed the <em>principle</em> of infant baptism. He just thought it was an unwise strategy. Tertullian never suggested that infant baptism was a recent innovation and was un-apostolic. Had he believed that, he would have said so. Tertullian was not a man to pull any of his punches. </p><p>Origen, in fact, positively claimed that the practice of infant baptism did go back to the apostolic age. Origen was born about 185 AD and into a Christian family. Growing up he would have known people in their sixties and seventies. If none of these people had been baptised as infants and they knew nothing of the relevant history, it is unlikely that Origen would have claimed the practice to be apostolic. Only 30 years before Origen's birth Polycarp was martyred, the godly bishop of Smyrna. At his martyrdom in 155 AD he declared that he had been a Christian from childhood:</p>
<blockquote><div>For eighty-six years I have been Christ's servant and he has done me no wrong, and how can I blaspheme my King who saved me?</div></blockquote>
<p>That takes Polycarp's birth back at least to 69 AD and the death of Paul if he was baptized as a child, or earlier if he wasn't. Polycarp knew whether or not infants were baptised in the time of the apostles. So people even in their forties and fifties, let alone sixties and seventies, when Origen was in his teens would have had reliable information. </p><p>To quote Anthony Lane again:</p>
<blockquote><div>Theology can of course change subtly over the years, but a simple fact like whether or not babies were baptized can easily be remembered. Polycarp knew from his own experience whether or not babies were baptised in the late apostolic age and it is unlikely that he and others took this information to the grave with them. This does not preclude changes taking place, but it does mean that informed Christians at the end of the second century, were not as ignorant of early practice as is usually assumed.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Augustine and Later</strong></p><p>The details of baptism are surely matters of secondary importance. However, the paradigm of baptism is clearly the baptism of new adult converts. But the majority in the history of the Church have found it hard to deny that for the children of at least many converts infant baptism was taking place in the apostolic age. When a significant number wanted to oppose the baptism of infants, it is unthinkable that no one pointed out that it was a non apostolic practice, but a more recent innovation.</p><p>Following the influence of men like Tertullian in the third and fourth centuries there were a lot of fine Christians who deferred baptism until a later age. So infant baptism was not always universal in the early church. Yet no one complained about infant baptism being a recent invention. One famous later example of those who deferred is Augustine (354-430). He documents in his <em>Confessions</em> how his mother wouldn't have him baptised as an infant. But, then, due to Augustine himself, infant baptism once again became the norm for Christian households. Augustine re-affirmed the doctrine of original sin and, against the Pelagians, reaffirmed the doctrine of the grace of God as the key element in salvation. For salvation is due to God's grace, not our faith: faith is simply the "spiritual" hand that receives God's gift of salvation - Ephesians 2.8:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Infant baptism, as a <em>verbum visibile</em> (a visible word), especially speaks of God's grace in salvation, if it is thought about carefully. However, for many people today baptism is believed to be more a sign and seal of their profession of faith than of God's grace and his pouring out of his Holy Spirit. True, God's grace has to be received by repentance and faith. But most important is faith in God's promise, which, as Peter said at Pentecost, is not only for Jews and their children but "for all whom <em>the Lord our God will call</em>."</p><p>Whatever faults Augustine may have had, he was clear on the grace of God. So his theology of baptism became an orthodoxy. Up until Augustine's time, infant baptism was a practice looking for a theology. Augustine, by pointing out the reality of sin and that salvation is not due to our faith but God's grace, provided that theology, whatever limitations it may have had.</p><p>But by the time of the Reformation infant baptism was so indiscriminately adminstered that the Anabaptists wanted to do away with it entirely. They did <br>not carry the day, though. The Magisterial Reformers - Luther, Calvin and the Anglicans - retained the practice. Godly moderate Baptists, however, in England kept the criticisms of infant baptism alive. </p><p>Then, alongside growing theological liberalism and secularism, that had begun in the 18th century, and that mushroomed in the 19th century (not least in Germany), and that then became an avalanche all over 20th century Europe and America, there was indiscriminate infant baptism in the modern age. This caused more and more of a scandal. Writing in 1952, one American Congregationalist, C.T.Craig, suggested that the concern about baptism in general and infant baptism in particular was due to ...</p>
<blockquote><div> ... the increasing awareness of the anomaly of a situation where millions of baptized persons have no active relation with the Church.</div></blockquote>
<p>In such a context the rejection of infant baptism often seemed a safe measure. Also the Protestant spiritual renewal beginning in the 1950's in the US was associated with Billy Graham (Baptist), in the UK it was greatly influenced by the IVF/UCCF and the London Bible College that were both funded significantly by the remarkable and generous John Laing (Plymouth Brother with baptist views), and in various other countries it was led by Pentecostals (also with baptist views). This has meant for many that a rejection of infant baptism has been uncritically accepted as axiomatic and "the truth".</p><p><br><strong>The Church of England and Jesmond</strong></p><p>What is the (official) doctrine of the Church of England on infant baptism? It is not so rigorous as the doctrine of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland which is found in the Reformation <em>Westminster Confession</em> and that says:</p>
<blockquote><div>not only those that do actually profess faith in and obedience unto Christ, but also the infants of one or both believing parents <em>are to be</em> baptized.</div></blockquote>
<p>Article XXVII simply says (among other things):</p>
<blockquote><div>The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.</div></blockquote>
<p>That, it needs to be noted, was a revision of an original which included the words "<em>commended and</em> ... retained". "Commended and" were deleted.</p><p>There is, therefore, not such a three-line whip in the Church of England as in the Church of Scotland. As an Anglican clergyman, I am fully committed to the historic practice of the Church of England and persuaded that it is the biblical way. But the Church of England has always been comprehensive over secondary matters. While having a dominant theology of baptism that embraces infant baptism, it is also generous to those who differ. </p><p>According to the <em>Preface</em> to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the Prayer Book service of <em>Publick Baptism of such as are of Riper Years</em> was included because "by the growth of Anabaptism ... crept in amongst us, [it] is now become necessary." This was a (reluctant) concession to the Anabaptists. In that same spirit, in the 1980 Alternative Service Book, there was introduced for the first time a service of <em>Thanksgiving for the Birth of a Child</em> in the Church of England. </p><p>So our own practice at Jesmond, as we say in CLASS 1, is that ...</p>
<blockquote><div>we baptize young children. This, however, is only where they will be brought up in a Christian family. It is on the basis of their parents' faith. There are also Thanksgiving Services for those who do not want their children baptized.</div></blockquote>
<p>Our own policy at Jesmond means that</p>
<blockquote><div>we don't agree with the extremes of either the paedo-baptist position or of the adult-baptist position. We don't agree with those who say all children must be baptized, even when they come from non-Christian families, nor with those who refuse to recognize as baptized those baptized as infants [and confirmed as adults or renewing their vows].</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Pastorally and theologically there is much more to say about infant baptism. But let me conclude with this comment. If the apostles baptized infants, they made it clear that Christian parents should bring their children up <em>as members</em> of the new convenant community, the church, but needing in adulthood to confirm that membership. They did not intend their children to be brought up <em>as outside</em> the community but needing in adulthood to opt in.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Fundamentalism and Islam">(August 2005) Fundamentalism and Islam</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2005</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li><li>7 July 2005</li><li>7/7</li><li>London Bombings</li><li>desecularization</li><li>morals</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Heaven and Hell</strong></p><p>That a person should die for their faith is hard for many Western Europeans to believe. But this is what, it seems, four young men did on the morning of 7 July in London when they became the first Muslim suicide bombers in British history and, terribly, killed 52 people and injured 700. Part of the reason why this is so unimaginable for many today is that current secular Western Europeans have little concept of heaven and hell. For the devout, Koran-believing, Muslim heaven and hell are very real and of eternal significance. The Koran has the phrase, "to believe in Allah <em>and the Last Day</em>". The Koran shares with Christianity a strong belief in the final judgment. </p><p>But the Koran denies that Jesus Christ truly died on the Cross for our sins. So Muslims do not have any assurance of heaven. The Cross, however, provides great assurance. It demonstrates God's love with Christ, the divine Son, dying in our place. That penal and substitutionary death of Christ is at the heart of the "good news" that relates not only to time but also to eternity. </p><p>The final judgment, therefore, for the Muslim depends entirely on how you live the current life. For the Muslim right living is living according to the teaching of Mohammed. Mohammed, they say, had been given direct teaching from Allah (when in a trance like state and, allegedly, through the Angel Gabriel). That teaching is recorded in the Koran and the Koran is strong on the final judgment. So securing a passage to heaven is very important for a devout Muslim. Some say suicidal martyrdom secures that passage.</p><p><br><strong>Patrick Sookhdeo</strong></p><p>In the <em>Spectator</em> for 30 July, Patrick Sookhdeo wrote a piece entitled "The myth of moderate Islam". He began by talking about Shehzad Tanweer, one of the four suicide bombers:</p>
<blockquote><div>The funeral of British suicide Shehzad Tanweer was held in absentia in his family's ancestral village, near Lahore, Pakistan. Thousands of people attended, as they did again the following day when a qul ceremony was held for Tanweer. During qul, the Koran is recited to speed the deceased's journey to paradise, though in Tanweer's case this was hardly necessary. Being a shahid (martyr), he is deemed to have gone straight to paradise. The 22-year-old from Leeds, whose bomb at Aldgate station killed seven people, was hailed by the crowd as 'a hero of Islam'.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>Some in Britain cannot conceive that a suicide bomber could be a hero of Islam. Since 7/7 many have made statements to attempt to explain what seems to them a contradiction in terms. Since the violence cannot be denied, their only course is to argue that the connection with Islam is invalid. The deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Brian Paddick, said that 'Islam and terrorists are two words that do not go together.' His boss, the Commissioner Sir Ian Blair, asserted that there is nothing wrong with being a fundamentalist Muslim.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>But surely we should give enough respect to those who voluntarily lay down their lives to accept what they themselves say about their motives. If they say they do it in the name of Islam, we must believe them. Is it not the height of illiberalism and arrogance to deny them the right to define themselves?</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Fundamentalism and Peter Berger</strong></p><p>So what is going on? The social reality of committed religious belief is something, sadly, beyond the conception of many ordinary citizens as well as of those now in leadership in Western Europe. But why is that? So many people around the world find no difficulty is understanding religious commitment. Let me try to explain.</p><p>Around the world there is a process of desecularization that is going on. An important book was published in 1999 entitled <em>The Desecularization of the World.</em> Its subtitle was "Resurgent Religion and World Politics". </p><p>Let me quote from the opening chapter on "A Global Overview" by Peter Berger, the doyen of social scientists and the book's editor. He is referring to the Fundamentalism Project - a project that was very generously funded by the MacArthur Foundation and chaired by Martin Marty, the distinguished church historian from the University of Chicago. Peter Berger writes:</p>
<blockquote><div>A number of very reputable scholars took part in it, and the published results are of generally excellent quality. But my contemplation of this first volume gave me what has been called an <em>aha!</em> experience" ... So I asked myself, why would the MacArthur Foundation shell out several million dollars to support an international study of religious fundamentalists?</div></blockquote>
<p>The important answer he came up with was this:</p>
<blockquote><div>Fundamentalism' is considered a strange, hard-to-understand phenomenon; the purpose of the Project was to delve into this alien world and make it more understandable. But to whom? <em>Who</em> finds this world strange? Well, the answer to<em> that</em> question was easy: people to whom the officials of the MacArthur Foundation normally talk, such as professors at elite American universities. And with this came the aha! experience. The concern that must have led to this Project was based on an upside-down perception of the world, according to which 'fundamentalism' (which, when all is said and done, usually refers to any sort of passionate religious movement) is a rare, hard-to-explain thing. But a look either at history or at the contemporary world reveals that what is rare is not the phenomenon itself but knowledge of it. The difficult-to-understand phenomenon is not Iranian mullahs but American university professors - it might be worth a multi-million-dollar project to try to explain that!</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>A Global Overview</strong></p><p>In his global overview, Peter Berger points out that "on the international scene, it is conservative or orthodox or traditionalist movements that are on the rise almost everywhere. These movements are precisely the ones that rejected an <em>aggiornamento</em> with modernity as defined by progressive intellectuals. Conversely, religious movements and institutions that have made great efforts to conform to a perceived modernity are almost everywhere on the decline. In the United States this has been a much commented upon fact, exemplified by the decline of the so-called mainline Protestantism and the concomitant rise of Evangelicalism; but the United States is by no means unusual in this."</p><p>He doesn't find the word "fundamentalist" particularly helpful "not only because it carries a pejorative undertone but also because it derives from the history of American Protestantism, where it has a specific reference that is distortive if extended to other religious traditions." However, he lets people use it as "it suggests a combination of several features - great religious passion, a defiance of what others have defined as the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, and a return to traditional sources of religious authority." These conservative "upsurges" are taking place around the world and outside Protestantism and outside Christianity. They are taking place in Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism as well as being in revival movements in smaller communities (such as Shinto in Japan and Sikhism in India). But they differ greatly in their social and political implications. However, "taken together they provide massive falsification of the idea that modernization and secularization are cognate phenomena. At the very least they show that <em>counter</em>-secularization is at least as important a phenomenon in the contemporary world as secularization." And the "differences" are nowhere clearer than in "what are arguably the two most dynamic religious upsurges in the world today, the Islamic and the Evangelical."</p><p>With regard to the Islamic upsurge "it affects every single Muslim country from North Africa to South-east Asia. It continues to gain converts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (where it is often in head-on competition with Christianity). It is becoming very visible in the burgeoning Muslim communities in Europe, and, to a much lesser extent, in North America." Nor are these revivals limited to the "less modernized or 'backward' sectors of society, as progressive intellectuals still like to think. On the contrary, it is very strong in cities with a high degree of modernization, and in a number of countries it is particularly visible among people with Western-style higher education - in Egypt and Turkey, for example, many daughters of secularized professionals are putting on the veil and other accoutrements of Islamic modesty." But, of course, there are great differences <em>within</em> Islam. Even in the Middle East and the Islamic heartlands you have Sunni and Shiite revivals that differ religiously and politically. Islamic conservatism, as the new King realizes, means different things in Saudi Arabia to what it means in Iran. Indonesia is different again.</p><p><br><strong>The European Exception</strong></p><p>So the world today is getting "religious"; that is not according to the secularists' plan. But there are two notable exceptions. The <em>first</em> exception is Europe west of the old "Iron Curtain". Secularization theory seems to be holding up in Western Europe. Here, increasing modernization has seen a decline in religious belief and religious practice - certainly in terms of church attendance, church related codes of moral and sexual behaviour and in terms of recruitment to the ordained ministry. The rejection of Rocco Buttiglione (a Roman Catholic) last Autumn as EU Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security and then the failure to acknowledge Europe's Christian heritage and value system in the proposed European Constitution is recent evidence of this "European Exception". However, that Constitution's rejection by the Netherlands and France may prove what some social scientists are saying, namely that there is still a significant body of silent religious and Christian attachment in Europe. (Let's pray it becomes audible.) The second exception is made up of an international subculture. It contains people with Western style higher education.</p>
<blockquote><div>This subculture is the principal 'carrier' of progressive, 'Enlightened' beliefs and values. While its members are relatively thin on the ground, they are very influential, as they control the institutions that provide the 'official' definitions of reality, notably the educational system, the media of mass communication, and the higher reaches of the legal system. They are remarkably similar all over the world today, as they have been for a long time (though ... there are also defectors from this subculture, especially in the Muslim countries).</div></blockquote>
<p>This globalized <em>elite</em> culture is, of course, particularly strong in Europe and in Britain. So there is a "double whammy" from both of these exceptions as far as the people of Britain are concerned. And this is the reason - this exceptional secularism - why so many people in Britain cannot conceive of how anyone can believe anything to be worth dying for.</p><p><br><strong>Richard Reid and the <em>Sunday</em> programme</strong></p><p>On the BBC Radio 4 <em>Sunday</em> programme on 24 July 2005, there was a discussion on the subject of "What makes someone blow himself up and kill anyone in the vicinity - be they man, woman or child, Christian, Jew or Muslim?" The presenter of the programme was Roger Bolton. For this item he was joined by Dr Zaki Badawi (the President of the Muslim College) who was described as being "in the forefront of interfaith dialogue"; he was also joined by Oliver Mcternan, a Roman Catholic priest who was described as the author of the book <em>Violence in God's name - religion in an age of conflict.</em></p><p>Zaki Badawi clearly thought the primary motivation of these bombers was political. "These youngsters," he said, "were mislead by people who have political ambitions and are using religion for that particular ambition." Oliver Mcternan "profoundly" disagreed: "The cause is political but inspired and motivated by religious belief (albeit misguided); but it is religious belief that motivates."</p><p>To prove his point Oliver Mcternan referred to Richard Reid, the British shoe bomber who tried (but failed) to blow up a Trans-Atlantic airliner on the 22 December 2001 and is now in prison in America. He was an enigma to many people. But Oliver Mcternan spoke of his conversation, while in Boston, with the two public prosecutors who had been appointed to defend Richard Reid. This is a transcript of what Oliver Mcternan said:"They [the Prosecutors] said: 'Can we come and talk to you, because we are just moved by this young man's convictions. It's totally contrary to what we are dealing with in our normal course of things - of murder and everything else.' They were profoundly moved by his understanding, albeit - and I agree with Zaki - a misguided understanding of his faith tradition. But he profoundly believed in it, so much so that they were worried about how it was impacting on them!"</p>
<p><br><strong>Dr Zaki Badawi</strong></p><p>But who does have the right understanding of the Muslim faith tradition? Does Zaki Badawi? He certainly has the understanding most people want to hear in Britain. Not surprisingly he was the Muslim asked by BBC Radio 4 to give their <em>Thought for the Day</em> on the <em>Today</em> programme on 13 September 2001. That was just two days after the terrible events of 11 September when the twin towers of the World Trade Centre were destroyed by Muslim suicide bombers and thousands were killed. (On the morning immediately after that awful destruction, an English bishop had been asked to give the <em>Thought for the Day</em>.) Dr Badawi concluded his short address with these words:</p>
<blockquote><div>In the Koran our Sustainer says, 'We ordained that if anyone killed a person ... not in retaliation of murder or in punishment ... it would be as if he killed all Mankind. And if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of all Mankind.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>Those who plan and carry out such acts [as the destroying of the twin towers] are condemned by Islam, and the massacre of thousands, whoever perpetrated it, is a crime against God as well as against humanity.</div></blockquote>
<p>But Zaki Badawi did not mention the very next verse of the Koran that follows the one he quoted (which was Sura 5.35). Sura 5.36 says this:</p>
<blockquote><div>The punishment of those who wage war against God and his Apostle [Mohammed], and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.</div></blockquote>
<p>Some have used this text to deal with converts from Islam to other religions. But the clearest verse on punishment for apostasy suggests that punishment takes effect after this life: "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God) never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good)" (Sura 3.85).</p><p><br><strong>The sword</strong></p><p>If you take the text of the Koran literally, you cannot deny that it does seem to validate force or violence to achieve spiritual goals. However, there is one verse the moderates can appeal to: "Let there be no compulsion in religion" (Sura 2.250). Much of the Koran is ethical teaching that is not controversial. Certainly the Christian distinction of General Revelation (that is open to all and can be discerned by all) and Special Revelation (that comes through Christ and the Bible alone) means that there is material in the Koran that Christians can agree with as Sura 2.250. But there is also material that the Christian has to reject. Nor is the Koran progressive as a revelation like the Bible is. For the Christian the Old Testament clearly has to be interpreted in the light of Christ. As Article VII of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England says: "Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts [the political and legal arrangements] thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet not withstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral." Those same articles make it clear that the Bible, "God's Word written", has to be the supreme and final authority for the church. Nevertheless, the supreme revelation is God's Incarnate word, Jesus Christ. For the Muslim it seems that the Koran takes the place of Christ and is quite absolute. And the Koran has clear instructions for the use of force or violence.</p><p>Sura 2 of the Koran is the Sura that the British Muslim Marmaduke Pickthall says, "might be described as the Koran in little. It contains mention of all the essential points of the Revelation, which are elaborated elsewhere." Most of it, of course, is not about fighting. But let me list the following (from the Yusuf Ali translation of Sura 2). Sura 2.190: "Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors." 191: "And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. But fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they first fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith." 192: "But if they cease, God is oft-forgiving and most merciful." 193: "And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression." 216: "Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not." 217: "They ask thee concerning fighting in the prohibited month. Say: 'Fighting therein is a grave offence; but graver is it in the sight of God to prevent access to the path of God, to deny him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members.' Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein." </p><p><br><strong>The Cross</strong></p><p>But Jesus says, "all who draw the sword will die by the sword" (Mat 26.52). This is not what a Koran-believing Muslim would naturally say. Of course, there are many different nuances within Islam within all its subdivisions. As in Christianity you will have liberals, middle of the roaders and conservatives. But as the world of the 21st century is discovering, it is the theological conservatives who are the true believers or those who are true to their founding authorities. So Dr Badawi may be seen as a "liberal" by more conservative Muslims who do not "pick and choose" their texts and who follow the generally agreed traditions regarding Mohammed. One such "conservative Muslim" was the Ayotallah Khomeini. He understood the common sense reading of the Koran that makes God always powerful and, apparently, successful. This gives you the sword rather than the cross. Bill Musk in his book <em>Holy War - why do some Muslims become Fundamentalists?</em> has this perceptive comment about Jesus and the way of the cross:</p>
<blockquote><div>Mohammed was a prophet of God and as such learned in Medina to model his caliphate or leadership on a philosophy of 'God's side is always successful'. Endemic in the common Muslim interpretation of the Koranic record of Jesus is the conviction that God could not possibly have allowed such a prophet of his to have failed. God would never have allowed the Jews to grab and kill this man. The truth must have been that God took the visage of Jesus and imposed it upon another human being at the crucial moment. Thus Jesus was raised to heaven and someone else (maybe Judas) was crucified in his stead.</div></blockquote>
<p>He then quotes Khomeini on the possibility of a "weak" Jesus and saying:</p>
<blockquote><div>This idea of turning the other cheek has been wrongly attributed to Jesus (peace be upon him); it is those barbaric imperialists that have attributed it to him. Jesus was a prophet, and no prophet can be so illogical.</div></blockquote>
<p>"Islam cannot cope," says Musk, "with a 'suffering' Messiah." The distinction between Islam and Christianity was summed up by Bishop Lesslie Newbigin: "The Prophet [Mohammed] rode into Mecca to conquer; Jesus rode into Jerusalem to die. The crux lies there."</p><p><br><strong>The <em>Muslim Manifesto</em></strong></p><p>Those words of Lesslie Newbigin were written during the public debate that followed the issuing of a <em>Muslim Manifesto</em> in 1990 by the London based Muslim Institute and that resulted in the founding of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain. Right at the start there were was a section on Assumptions. Key among them was the following: "Of all the major religions of the world, Islam is the most 'politicised'. At its inception Islam created a political platform from which Muslims were to launch themselves on a global role as founders of great States, empires and a world civilization and culture. Political and cultural subservience goes against their grain. Yet in Britain today Muslims are being asked to accept subservience and the total disintegration of their identity, culture and religion, as the only real options open to them." So another key assumption was "that the option of 'integration' and/or 'assimilation' that is on offer as official policy in Britain must be firmly resisted and rejected."</p><p>Now, undoubtedly these views of Dr Kalim Siddiqui, the drafter of this manifesto, are not held by all Muslims in Britain. There must be a good number, perhaps the majority, who are very uncomfortable with this sort of approach. For the manifesto supports <em>jihad:</em> "<em>Jihad</em> is a basic requirement of Islam, and living in Britain or having British nationality by birth or naturalization does not absolve the Muslim from his or her duty to participate in<em> jihad:</em> this participation can be active service in armed struggle abroad and/or the provision of material and moral support to those engaged in such struggle anywhere in the world." And this claims Koranic support. But which is the voice of true Islam - such a conservative statement, or statements of moderates or modernizers? Take Tariq Ali for example. Having given up his revolutionary Marxism of the 60s, he now seems to be a reformist Muslim:</p>
<blockquote><div>We are in desperate need of an Islamic Reformation that sweeps away the crazed conservatism and backwardness of the fundamentalists but, more than that, opens up the world of Islam to new ideas which are seen to be more advanced than what is currently on offer from the West. This would necessitate a rigid separation of state and mosque; the dissolution of the clergy; the assertion by Muslim intellectuals of their right to interpret the texts that are the collective property of Islamic culture as a whole; the freedom to think freely and rationally and the freedom of imagination.</div></blockquote>
<p>I suspect that many Muslims' view such comments as Evangelical Christians view certain comments of liberal bishops.</p><p><br><strong>Morality</strong></p><p>A large part of the problem that Muslims are being faced with at this present moment is the call to "be British". Islam has, as have all religions, its share of hypocrisy regarding morality and sexual morality in particular. And the Muslim treatment of women is not always good. Nevertheless Koran-believing Muslims have a code that in a number of areas Christians share and they see this being eroded on all sides in modern Britain. They are not so sure they want to "be British" if it means being immoral. </p><p>Not so long ago I was asked to be a lead contributor in an ITV young people's discussion programme on homosexuality. It was a totally new experience for me. Often in programmes of that sort and on that subject I have been in a minority of one when arguing for the reasonableness of sexual restraint and Christian sexual ethics. Often I have been quite abused (verbally). This time it was a shock. I, with one or two other Christian young people, were in terms of our views and attitudes in the middle between the aggressive homosexual lobby and a number of Muslim young people who were also aggressive (and quite articulate) on the other side. It was clear that these Muslim young people did not like decadent Britain. </p><p>But it has been opposition to such decadence that is a factor behind extremist Islam. At the beginning of the rise of fundamentalist Islam, one of its modern founders Sayyid Qutb, the Egyptian Islamist ideologue who was executed by President Nasser's police in 1966, wrote this: "Humanity is living in a large brothel! One only has to glance at its press, films, fashion shows, beauty contests, ballrooms, wine bars, and broadcasting stations! Or observe its mad lust for naked flesh, provocative postures, and sick, suggestive statements in literature, the arts and the mass media!". That is over the top. But the rise of this new version of Islam coincided with the sixties and the breakdown of traditional sexual morality in the West. And many Muslims still do not like what they see of the West in moral terms. They then find it hard being asked to assimilate to something which is so against their own traditions and morality. One leader of resurgent Islam has said that the problem is not really political, rather it is at the level of ...</p>
<blockquote><div>... two cultures and civilizations, one based upon Islamic values and the other on the values of materialism and nationalism. Had Western culture been based on Christianity, on morality, on faith, the language and <em>modus operandi</em> of the contact and conflict would have been different. But that is not the case. The choice is between the Divine Principle and a secular materialist culture.</div></blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Muslim Manifesto</em> it was said that some British laws were in direct conflict "with the laws of Allah". Included were those relating to abortion and homosexuality. Then under "Goals of the Muslim Community in Britain" there were the following: "to develop the Muslim community as an island of peace, harmony and moral excellence, free of promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases, drinking, gambling, drug-addiction, fornication and the related social and moral disorders which plague our age."</p><p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Looking at the papers to see what people were writing on Islam in the last week of July, in one paper I saw a huge amount about the capture of the suspected 21 July terrorists. But on another page was a feature on filming gay sex scenes for a new BBC production. We were told that the corporation commissioned a producer "in part because of his willingness to portray bedroom scenes and to make explicit sex scenes where in the original book there might be only a subtle hint." And on the sofa besides me was the <em>Church of England Newspaper</em> with the main headline: "Church allows gay clergy to register partnerships". Then, of course, there was the BBC production of <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em> with its blasphemy of Jesus not long before the bombings of July. Many Muslims would have been appalled at that production just as Christians were. All this is undoubtedly a factor behind suicide bombings. On 2 August a letter was published that was written from prision in America by Richard Reid. The report said that in it he "launches an attack on US foreign policy ... as well as hitting out at Western governments which 'glorify' and 'promote' immorality in the name of freedom."</p><p>There is indeed a clash of civilizations in the world and in Britain. What is currently being played out in Britain, however, is not a clash between Islam and the West. Rather it is a clash between Islam, Christianity and a secular decadent West, in which Christianity is in the middle. What is the way ahead? It is vital that we preserve those freedoms that were secured at the end of the 17th century after the Wars of Religion. In simple terms it was then agreed that no longer could the State enforce any religious belief. Nevertheless the State still could and must outlaw violence and sexual immorality. That meant in Britain that under an overarching Christian establishment there could be subordinate pluralisms. Of course, secularists are happy with outlawing violence and Muslims happy with outlawing sexual immorality. But Muslims must renounce violence more than they seem to be doing at present and secularists must work for a change in sexual behaviour and the reinstitutionalization of marriage. And with freedom secured, there can be open debate over the truth claims of each world view or "civilization". Then, as Christians, we must speak the truth in love, as it is, and only is, in Jesus.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Postmodernism - A Sermon">(September 2005) Postmodernism - A Sermon</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2005</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>Sunday 10 July 2005 was the Commemoration Day for the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. It also was the Sunday after Thursday 7 July, when extremist Muslim suicide bombers in London killed 52 people, injuring 700. As it happens I was down to preach at Jesmond Parish Church on "The Culture and the Future". The intention was to talk about "relativism" and the way so many have lost an interest is questions of truth. Some asked if I would write up what I said as a Coloured Supplement. In the event (for August 2005) I decided to write on "Fundamentalism and Islam". But the media discussions following 7 July (and the failed suicide bomb attempts on 21 July) have revealed just how important it is to understand what is going on in our culture. Some journalists and commentators seem incapable of asking questions about what is true. For example, few (certainly on the BBC) seem interested in what the Koran actually teaches compared with what the Bible teaches and, then, in asking where the truth lies. There is an assumption that both are "legitimate" and questions of truth or falsity are irrelevant. But questions as to whether Jesus Christ actually was crucified and truly died is a simple and fundamental question of truth. All this is an amazing and frightening phenomenon, not least in the light of the Government's proposed incitement to Religious Hatred legislation. For if "truth" is simply a matter of personal choice, the concept of "hating" fundamental objective error as evil (a biblical requirement - Romans 12.9) is beyond a postmodern person's conception. It is, for them, a form of "hating the person". When people think there is little objective truth in matters of belief but all depends on personal choice, it is serious because it does not allow for rational discussion, only assertion and expression of feeling. If your beliefs allow violence to accompany assertion, that is indeed frightening. (This also relates to the national consultation the Government wants regarding the human embryo and assisted reproductive technologies.) So here is a transcript of that sermon of 10 July. It seems best to give it exactly as said. This needs to be kept in mind.</em></p><p>Our title this morning is <em>The Culture and the Future</em>. This is fitting for a day like today when we look back 60 years to the end of World War II and inevitably take stock. But what is "culture"? The word is used in so many different ways. Anthropologists tell us that culture is "all learned human behaviour which is socially acquired." Culture, however, has to do with beliefs as well as behaviour. That is why now there are what are called "culture wars" - over matters such as education, sexual behaviour, abortion, euthanasia and so on. To help us with our thinking I want us to look at Psalm 11, which (its heading says) is "For the director of music. Of David". Particularly I want to address the question in verse 3 (see below):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>1 In the Lord I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain. 2 For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. 3When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?" 4 The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them. 5 The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence his soul hates. 6 On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulphur; a scorching wind will be their lot. 7 For the Lord is righteous, he loves justice; upright men will see his face </em>(NIV).</div></blockquote>
<p><em>First</em>, I want us to think about the first half of verse 3: "when the foundations are being destroyed". Then I want us to address the question that forms the <em>second</em> half of the verse: "what can the righteous do?" And, <em>thirdly</em>, I want to ask, "what did David - the psalmist - do?"</p><p><br>So, <strong><em>first</em>, "When the Founations are Being Destroyed"</strong></p><p>This is a Psalm of king David, we are told. We have no idea what these "foundations" were that are being referred to. Scholars have guesses. But the good thing about our not being sure is this. It means the psalm can be helpful to any individual or any group of people experiencing the destruction of what is foundational in their own situation - whether in their own personal lives or in the wider world. This morning I want us to apply it to foundations in the wider world. There is undoubtedly today at a national level, and even international level, foundational destruction. There is a "cultural collapse" occurring. The foundations - civilizational foundations - are being destroyed, certainly in Europe and the West. </p><p>Raymond Johnston used to be church warden at JPC when I first came to the church over 30 years ago. He was a remarkable man and left Newcastle to be the founder and director of the Christian charity <em>CARE</em>. One of his books was entitled <em>Christianity in a collapsing culture</em>. That was written in 1976 not long after I arrived at Jesmond. He began by saying that "Britain today stands on the brink of a precipice. Many have watched with concern the changes in the mood of the nation over the last twenty years." He was referring to the social revolution of the 1960s and the decadence that followed; and his book is a response to that revolution. Many argue that things have collapsed even further since the 70s. The main difference now is that not only is there a collapse but the collapse is being celebrated and endorsed as never before. Let me try to explain, first, by saying what is going on and, secondly, by saying what are some of the results.</p><p><em>First</em>, what is going on? Answer: we now have a culture in Europe and the West where for many there are no absolute or universal truths. Nothing is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. All is relative. Now, it is said, you can make up your own standards and morals, and I can make up mine. And these ideas are being taught in our universities, colleges and schools. Uncritical students accept this "post-modern" (as it is called) teaching. Of course, most people know very little about all the academic discussions going on. But ideas have wings and they spread and gradually affect the whole culture not least through the press and the electronic media of TV and Radio. Let me quote one famous postmodernist teacher - a Professor of English at Oxford (he is using the jargon of academic Postmodernism): </p><p>"We are now in the process of wakening from the nightmare of modernity, with its manipulative reason and fetish of the totality, into the laid-back pluralism of the post-modern, that heterogeneous range of lifestyles and language games which has renounced the nostalgic urge to totalise and legitimate itself."</p><p>By the "fetish of the totality" he means a world view, such as the Bible gives you - a total picture of reality. That now has to be rejected, he says, in favour of a "range of lifestyles" that you don't need to "legitimate". For you can just choose to do what you like. You see, people are now rejecting the modernism that goes back to the 18th century - hence the term "<em>Post</em>modernism". Such "modernism" was an aspect or fruit of what historians call the European Enlightenment. That was a period when, beginning in the 18th century, <em>one</em>, there was a general rejection of the God of the Bible; <em>two</em>, a deification of human reason; and <em>three</em> a denial of the doctrine of sin together with a belief in the perfectibility of man. People said that if God existed he certainly never interfered in human affairs; and any problems with the human race would be sorted out either by education or by evolution. So "modernism" rejected God but kept reason. Postmodernism, however, seeing the failures of modernism in the 20th century - not least in the two World Wars - has decided to reject not only God but reason as well. That is what is going on.</p><p><em>Secondly</em>, then, what are the results of all this? Let me give you at least three of the results. <em>First</em>, there is a new level of irrationality, with the human will and human emotions taking over from the human mind. If there are no true or absolute principles, all you can have in life are preferences or things you simply like. This in turn means a new level of sexual and marital immorality - another feature of Postmodernism. So if your "will" or "preference" is to sleep around, commit adultery, break-up your marriage, engage in homosexual relationships or even in bestiality, so be it. All is permitted. </p><p><em>Secondly</em>, there is a new anti-humanism. Modernism was humanistic. Postmodernism is not. Denying the God of the bible and mankind made in his image, Postmodernism often sees no theoretical reason to treat human beings differently to animals. One extremist is on record as even saying that human beings are an evolutionary mistake. He says he has more sympathy for threatened insect species than for children dying of hunger in Africa. </p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, there is loss of freedom and Christians are being attacked as freedom is eroded. When there are no values or commonly held beliefs and everything is relative, "might is right". Tolerance goes out of the window when there is a clash of preferences. And there is no protection for those who believe that not everything is relative. Witness the Religious Hatred Bill going through Parliament at this moment, and that, if passed, will mean a huge loss of freedom for Christians. It seems it will be possible to prosecute someone for saying that Jesus Christ is right and Mohammed is wrong. This is already happening in Australia. So do pray for the defeat of the Bill. But don't be surprised when God's people are attacked and don't be surprised at the subtlety of the attacks. This was happening to king David. Look at verse 2: "For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot [note] <em>from the shadows</em> at the upright in heart [they haven't got the bottle to do it openly]."</p><p><br>That leads, <strong><em>secondly</em></strong>, to <strong>"What Can the Righteous Do?"</strong> There are, again, at least three answers to that question. </p><p><em>First</em>, you can "flee" or somehow hide away and pretend nothing is happening. Look at verse 1b of Psalm 11: "How then can you say to me: 'Flee like a bird to the mountain.'"</p><p>But that is not the way of Jesus Christ. His prayer for his disciples was this: "My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one" (John 17:15). So the first option when the foundations are being destroyed is to runaway and not face up to what is going on.</p><p><em>Secondly</em>, you can compromise and drift and "go with the flow". That is a universal temptation. It was in Old Testament times; it was in New Testament times; and it is today. There was a survey in the United States not so long ago that showed that 66 percent of people believed that there is no absolute truth, with 72 percent of the "next generation" believing that and, listen, 53 percent of people who call themselves evangelical. </p><p>Arnold Toynbee in his mid-20th century study of civilizations found that there were three temptations for people with collapsing cultures. He called them "idolatries". They were in effect, <em>one</em>, the idolatry of nationalism; <em>two</em>, the idolatry of unity on a global scale; and <em>three</em>, the idolatry of technology. How prophetic he was in respect of the postmodern world! We have seen the idolatry of nationalism after the collapse of the USSR, not least in the former Yugoslavia where nationalisms erupted in terrible and bloody ways. We have seen the idolatry of unity in the futile hope that the United Nations, the International Court at the Hague, the IMF, the G8, the EU and so on, could be ultimate solutions to the world's problems - valuable as those may be in humbler ways. And we have seen the idolatry of technology that disregards moral restraints in aspects of medicine, in weapons of mass destruction and in the abuse of the electronic media. And Christians can be tempted in those areas as well as others. So the second option is to drift and compromise when the foundations are being destroyed.</p><p>The <em>third</em> option, and the only genuine Christian one, is to pray and then make sure you have a Christian mind; and then express it, confess it and teach it, as and when you can (see John Stott, <em> New Issues Facing Christians Today</em>, p 37). This is well summed up by Paul in Romans chapter 12 and verse 2: "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - his good, pleasing and perfect will." In a day when reason is being rejected it is all the more important for Christian men and women to be people of reason - not deifying reason like the modernists; nor rejecting reason like the postmodernists; but having a biblical attitude to reason. Paul makes it so clear that the way to resist being conformed to a culture when it is wrong, is to be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Paul is here setting before his readers two alternatives. </p><p>On the one hand, you can be conformed to this world and its standards (or lack of them, at the moment), its values (which for many are still materialistic) and its goals (which are self-centred and godless). This is the prevailing culture. And you can drift with it. On the other hand, the way to resist is to be transformed by the renewing of your mind. The assumption is that your renewed mind will have an effect on your behaviour. But this renewed mind has to be a "humble" mind. So Paul tells the Philippians in chapter 2 verse 5: "Your attitude [or mind] should be the same as that of Christ Jesus." And Jesus himself says in Matthew 11.29: "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." </p><p>As the Holy Spirit fills us and works in us so we should be doing just that - being humble, like Christ. Humility is so essential to the Christian mind. Paul immediately says in the next verse in Romans 12 - verse 3: "For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you." God's ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts, that is why we need his revelation. So humbly you need to admit your need for the teaching of prophets and apostles and of Jesus. That is why the Bible is so important. That is where you find that teaching. You discover in the Bible a total picture - not about everything possible but sufficient for our needs; and that total picture is something the postmodernists so hate. But it is a world view that is essential to understanding life and eternity. This world view is summarized in the creeds and various Christian confessions of faith. And it hinges on four cosmic events - the Creation (at the beginning of history), the Fall, the Redemption and the Consummation, when Christ will come again (at the end of history). </p><p>Having this world view the Christian knows that this world is good, because God made it and man is unique, because he is made in the image and likeness of God. But he also knows that man and the world have massive problems because of the rejection of God and his word by the first man and woman and then by every man and woman. So to continue to reject God as postmodernists do is utter folly. For God judges that rejection since it leads to death and destruction and all that is against God's creative purposes for life and fulfilment. So, of course, he has to condemn and outlaw rebellion against his word and will. But the good news is that God in his love has provided a genuine way of escape. </p><p>This way of escape began with Abraham whom God promised to bless along with his descendants. It continued as he renewed this promise - together with the obligations that went with it - at various points in Israel's history. Then the promised Messiah came - Jesus Christ. He was the one who would inaugurate the new age and fulfil God's promises and blessing through his death for our sins on the cross and his resurrection to new life that first Easter morning. But the end is not yet. For there will be a consummation when Christ will return. The dead will be raised; he will judge the world; there will be a new heavens and a new earth; and pain, sin, sorrow and death will be no more. To know those truths comes from having the Christian world view and the Christian mind. And that has to be the framework for all our thinking about a nation's culture and our own culture. So of course the Christian knows that not all beliefs are the same. Of course you cannot just make up your own values. Of course men and women are special and significant. Of course you have to assert that Jesus Christ is the only way.</p><p>To recap: when the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do? They can flee, but they shouldn't. They can drift, but they shouldn't. They can, and they should, have a Christian mind and think accordingly. And, in so far as God had revealed himself to David (at that stage of salvation history), David had such a mind.</p><p><br>So, <strong><em>thirdly</em>, What Did David Do?</strong></p><p>The <em>first</em> thing he did was to put God first and put his trust in God. Look at Psalm 11 verse 1: "In the Lord I take refuge."</p><p><em>Secondly</em>, he had a sense of perspective as he exercised his godly mind. Men and women may be destroying the foundations but he knew that God is still sovereign over all. He is still ruling over all. That is so encouraging. Look at verse 4: "The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord is on his heavenly throne."</p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, he remembered the reality of judgment. One day the Lord will judge. Each one will have to go before him at the judgment day. Look at verse 4b: "He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them. The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence his soul hates. On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulphur; a scorching wind will be their lot." There is a reference there (in the "fiery coals and burning sulphur") to the judgment in history on Sodom and Gomorrah - proverbial in David's time (as it is today) for degeneracy and decadence. Oh yes! The Bible teaches that such behaviour gets judged in the present as well as at the end. </p><p>Of course, the postmodern mind cannot cope with this - the idea of sin, judgment and hell. If reality is determined by what you like, and you don't like the thought of sin, judgment and hell, then you say these things are not real. But reality is not determined by your preferences or your likes - witness the terrible events of last Thursday in London. And love says you have to warn people of terrible things, as last night people in Birmingham were warned about a threatened terrorist attack and so took appropriate action. It was Luther who famously said: "The ultimate proof of the sinner is that he doesn't know his own sin. Our job is to make him see it." </p><p><em>Fourthly</em>, the Psalmist remembers that there are absolutes. Look at verse 7: "For the Lord is righteous, he loves justice; upright men will see his face." And there you have the good news. God doesn't want his last word to be about judgment but about men and women being in a relationship with him - the Psalmist calls it "seeing his face".</p><p>So let me <strong>conclude</strong> with this question. Who needs "to see God's face" this morning, perhaps for the first time? If so, what then do you need to do? Answer, repent and believe - to use the biblical words. You turn away from your sin and rebellion and turn back to God and his word; you trust Christ for forgiveness, which is freely given through the Cross where he died for your sins; and you receive new life by his Holy Spirit.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Racial and Religious Hatred Bill: A Legal Perspective">(October 2005) The Racial and Religious Hatred Bill: A Legal Perspective</h2><ul><li>October 2005</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>

<p><em>Daniel Scot, a Pakistani Christian, was forced to flee his home country because of Muslim persecution. Having settled in Australia he was indicted under the Religious Hatred laws of the State of Victoria. This was for his teaching in a local church on Islam, in which he is an expert. Visiting the UK in the summer he spoke at some meetings sponsored by the Christian Institute about his recent experiences. </em></p><p><em>One of the meetings was in Gateshead. Unfortunately many were away on holiday as it was the end of August. They were, therefore, unable to hear how Daniel Scot is concerned to alert people in Britain to the dangers of the similar (if not worse) legislation that is being forced through our own Parliament at this very time. The Bill is being considered by the House of Lords during October – hence the need for Christians and other people of good will to write to MPs, visit MPs and take other action to make their views known. </em></p><p><em>At one of these mid-summer meetings in the south, Mark Mullins, a barrister, gave the following address. This transcript and an "audio" of a meeting, together with other helpful material about the Bill are available on the</em>Christian Institute's <em>website</em> "www.christian.org.uk."</p><p> DRJH</p><p><br><strong>The Bill</strong></p><p>The Government is aware of Daniel Scot's case but does not believe that the same thing could happen in the UK. The purpose of this talk is to show there are serious dangers in the proposed offence of inciting hatred against persons on religious grounds that would catch exactly this sort of behaviour here in the UK. The Bill will amend Section 18 of the <em>Public Order Act 1986</em> so that it will read:</p>
<blockquote><div>A person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting, is guilty of an offence if -</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>(a) he intends thereby to stir up racial or religious hatred, or</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>(b) having regard to all the circumstances the words, behaviour or material are (or is) likely to be heard or seen by any person in whom they are (or it is) likely to stir up racial or religious hatred.</div></blockquote>

<p>This is nothing less than a blasphemy law for all religions which, in my view, will be used to restrict Christians preaching the Gospel. I will now take you through this offence to try and show you how potentially dangerous it seems to be.</p><p><br><strong>The Threshold for Committing the Offence</strong></p><p>First, the "words, behaviour or material" must be "threatening, abusive or insulting." These words will be given their ordinary dictionary meaning. While the courts have held that words which are rude or offensive are not necessarily insulting, the example of Harry Hammond demonstrates that, where Christians are concerned, the threshold can be disturbingly low. </p><p>Mr Hammond was a 67 year old street preacher who suffered from Asperger's syndrome. On 13 October 2001 he stood in the Square in Bournemouth holding a placard displaying the words: "Stop immorality. Stop homosexuality. Stop lesbianism". </p><p>This sign stirred up the crowd, resulting in Mr Hammond being attacked and pushed to the ground with mud and water being poured over him. Mr Hammond was arrested and later convicted for displaying the sign. Very sadly Mr Hammond died shortly afterwards. </p><p>Following his conviction his case was appealed to the High Court who held that the magistrates were entitled to find the sign to be insulting, because it appeared to relate homosexuality and lesbianism to immorality. </p><p>The provision that the words must be "threatening, abusive or insulting" will not provide much protection, if this case is anything to go by. One can easily see how other religions would be insulted by the claim of the Christian faith that all are sinners destined for hell and the only way to God is through His Son, Jesus Christ. </p><p>It is worth noting that the ancient common law offence of blasphemy required the words to be contemptuous, scurrilous and ludicrous in matters relating to God, Jesus Christ, the Bible and the formularies of the Church of England: very similar you might think - but wait.</p><p><br><strong>Religious Hatred</strong></p><p>Just as the words "threatening, abusive or insulting" will be given their normal meaning, so also will "hatred". The dictionary defines hatred as "intense dislike or detestation". This is the same definition that the Australian court used in Daniel Scot's case. </p><p>What is worrying about the stirring up of hatred is that it is <em>a wholly subjective state of mind</em> which is not necessarily linked to any outward form of behaviour. </p><p>However, the common law offence of blasphemy required the words or behaviour - complained of - to tend to endanger society by endangering the peace or depraving public morality or shaking the fabric of society or being a cause of civil strife. While these may be quaint expressions <em>at least they have an objective element to them</em>.</p><p>Religion in the Bill is not defined and can, therefore, cover cults including Satanism. We saw recently that on HMS Cumberland a Satanist was given permission to read his Satanic scriptures on board ship.</p><p>In the State of Victoria, Australia, a witch used the same law that caught Daniel Scot, to argue that the King James Bible has the potential to vilify many groups in Australian society and should not be used by people running the Alpha course, a widely used introductory course to Christianity. Although this claim was thrown out by the court, it shows how easy it is for anybody of apparently any religious belief to bring a complaint.</p><p><br><strong>Intention</strong></p><p>The offence of stirring up religious hatred does not require intention because the offence is also framed in the alternative (b):</p>
<blockquote><div>(a) he must either intend to stir up racial or religious hatred; <em>or</em></div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>(b) having regard to all the circumstances the words, behaviour or material <em>are (or is) likely to be heard or seen by any person in whom they are (or it is) likely to stir up racial or religious hatred</em>.</div></blockquote>
<p>So, in summary, you can be guilty of religious incitement if your words are deemed insulting, and there is <em>a likelihood that at least one person is likely to feel intense dislike as a result</em>.</p><p><br><strong>Defences</strong></p><p>Let us look at the defences for the offence in the Bill:</p>
<blockquote><div>(4) In proceedings for an offence under this section it is a defence for the accused to prove that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the written material displayed, would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>(5) A person who is not shown to have intended to stir up racial or religious hatred is not guilty of an offence under this section if he did not intend his words or behaviour, or the written material, to be, <em>and was not aware that it might be</em>, threatening, abusive or insulting.</div></blockquote>
<p>You will notice that <em>truth</em> is not a defence and so raises the question about how serious the Government really is about protecting the rights of people to confront the misconceived, though genuinely held, beliefs of others. Furthermore, in sub-clause five (above) a person has to show that he <em>was not aware that his words might be</em>, threatening, abusive or insulting. When it comes to criticising other people's beliefs or lack of them, most people are aware that their words <em>might be</em> insulting to those who hold the views under scrutiny. After all, we are warned by Paul in Galatians 5 against removing "the offence of the cross".</p><p><br><strong>Standard and Burden of Proof and Penalties</strong></p><p>While it is true to say that the "standard of proof" is the "criminal standard", this factor is neutralised somewhat under the new offence because the threatening, abusive of insulting words or behaviour must only be <em>likely</em>. to be heard by someone in whom hatred is <em>likely</em> to be stirred up.</p><p>If a person is found guilty of stirring up religious hatred then he, or she, faces seven years imprisonment. Compare this with the offence of causing grievous bodily harm which covers all really serious harm (short of murder) under Section 20 of the <em>Offences Against the Persons Act 1861</em>. What Section 20 has in common with this offence is that intention is not required. However, the maximum sentence for causing really serious harm is only five years – two years less than for stirring up religious hatred. </p><p>On 22 June 2005 Daniel Scot was ordered to apologise for his comments during the church seminar and not to speak about the Koran or Islam anywhere in Australia. If Daniel Scot does not comply, then he will find himself in prison. </p><p>This indicates a further danger to the UK law. If it is passed, then it could act as a justification for Local Authorities and the Police to apply for Anti-Social Behaviour Orders in similar circumstances to Daniel Scot. It also opens the possibility of Private Injunctions being applied for by organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain.</p><p><br><strong>The European Convention on Human Rights and the Need for this Law</strong></p><p>I think it is unlikely that a general challenge to the new offence of "religious incitement" as being incompatible with the rights to freedom of religion and speech would succeed. These rights can be limited in certain circumstances, although it may be that individual cases might be in breach.</p><p>The Government says that the new offence is aimed at really serious cases and they refer to the attacks on mosques after 11 September. Of course firebombing a mosque, or a church, or anywhere else, is <em>already illegal</em>. It is already illegal to incite someone to commit criminal damage or violence to a person or to commit a terrorist offence. It is already illegal to harass someone, shouting at them in the street or pestering them with nuisance phone calls or poison pen letters. </p><p>The Government says the new law addresses what they call a gap - a lacuna - whereby existing race law protects Jews and Sikhs with mono-ethnic religions, but does not protect those with multi-ethnic religions such as Christians and Muslims. However, race and religion are two very different things. Race is unchangeable, but people change religion all the time. Race has no moral component. Religion, by definition, determines a person's morals. </p><p>Let me read you the previous Home Secretary's example of a situation where the prosecuting authorities would consider taking action under the new offence:</p>
<blockquote><div>… in response to an extreme racist organisation widely distributing material setting out a range of insulting and highly inflammatory reasons for hating Islam. Such reasons have included suggesting that Muslims are a threat to British people and liable to molest women and that they should be urgently driven out of Britain.</div></blockquote>
<p>However, even this offence is caught by existing legislation. Section 31 of the <em>Crime and Disorder Act 1998 </em>contains the offence of religiously aggravated harassment. The religious aggravation element was inserted by the <em>Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001</em>. On 9 January 2002 Mr Norwood, the regional organiser of the British National Party, displayed a poster in the first-floor window of his flat in Shropshire, containing words in very large print "Islam out of Britain" and "Protect the British people". A member of the public was offended by the poster, reported the matter to the Police who removed it and charged Norwood with the offence of causing religiously or racially aggravated harassment, alarm or distress under Section 31 of the <em>Crime and Disorder Act 1998</em>.</p><p>He was convicted in the Magistrates Court and the conviction was upheld in the High court who found that the sign was insulting to Muslims. </p><p>The European Court of Human Rights rejected a claim to review this decision as inadmissible. It found that such a general, vehement, attack against a religious group, linking the group as a whole with a grave act of terrorism, is incompatible with the values proclaimed and guaranteed by the Convention, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination. So existing legislation can be used.</p><p><br><strong>Attorney General's Fiat</strong></p><p>The Government say that no prosecutions will take place without the consent of the Attorney General. However, this will place an enormous amount of pressure on one man; and expectations of some in the "faith community" may cause him to allow prosecutions that the Act was never intended to cover. Even if the current Attorney-General resists such pressures, what about his successor, or his successor's successor? The other practical problem with this safeguard is that the Attorney General will not make a decision until after a (possibly) lengthy and intrusive police investigation which will inevitably involve unnecessary anxiety for otherwise law abiding members of the community. This could be seriously disruptive if complaints were made at the beginning of a five day university mission, for example. </p><p><br><strong>"Chilling Effect"</strong></p><p>Unfortunately once this offence becomes law no amount of Government assurances will really matter. It is then in the hands of the courts; and it will take on a life of its own. The danger with the incitement to religious hatred law is not just that there will be prosecutions. It is the "chilling effect". You will recall that eighteen months ago the Bishop of Chester was investigated by the police for saying that homosexuals could be cured by therapy. Even though he had committed no offence, the threat of police investigation can have a disproportionate effect on normally law abiding citizens and discourage them from coming any where near to crossing the line. There have also been examples of the police threatening prosecutions under the existing law for seeking to proselytise Muslims. </p><p><br><strong>A Stick to Beat Opponents?</strong></p><p>The final danger is that this proposed law could be used as a stick by people to beat their religious opponents with, as the Daniel Scot case demonstrates. Premier Radio is a Christian radio station based in London. In 2001 the Mysticism and Occultism Federation used five part-time monitors to listen in to the station with the deliberate intention of taking offence and making complaints against it. They objected to them airing preachers warning of the danger of dabbling in the occult. Surprisingly, the Radio Authority upheld some of their complaints. As a result of these complaints the renewal of Premier Radio's broadcasting licence was put in jeopardy, although it was in the end renewed. In Australia it is reported that Muslims are having their meetings infiltrated by Christians. We can see how this could quickly turn into a tit-for tat exercise with the Attorney-General being caught in the middle and being censured for whatever action he takes.</p><p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In summary then, I believe that this is a further erosion of our Christian privileges in this land. The Christian faith has been protected historically because it represents the cultural heritage of this country – and, more importantly, because it is true. The effect of according equal standing to all other religions will inevitably be at the expense of the truth, as we have seen in Australia with Daniel Scot's case. As the Prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah 59.14:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>So justice is driven back and righteousness stands at a distance: truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter.</em></div></blockquote>

<p><br><strong><em>Post-script by DRJH</em></strong></p><p><em>Who said the following?</em> 1) "O disciples, seek the love of God by your hatred of sinners." 2) "Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities – but the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world." 3) "The Koran says: 'Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into the enemies of Allah and your enemies' (Sura 8.60)." 4) Referring to views such as those in 1) and 3), "they are perverted and poisonous." <em>Answers</em>: 1) The "prophet" Jesus according to Muslim teachers who allege this is one of his non-biblical sayings. 2) Winston Churchill. 3) An Iraqi terrorist. 4) Tony Blair, the instigator of this Bill. All these remarks could fall under its ban. Is that what is wanted? </p><p>Yes, restrain terrorists but for what they do (including inciting action), not for what they think. The state can restrain actions but it is dangerous if beliefs and ideas, which are promoting neither violence nor gross immorality, are not free. False beliefs and ideas must be vigorously countered, but by argument and preaching the gospel, not by the force of penal sanctions. To restrain beliefs and ideas, both false <em>and true<em>, as this legislation will restrain them, is to go back on basic, hard won, democratic freedoms. God allows our freedom - the doctrine of hell proves that. We must never destroy his great and good gift.</em></em></p><p></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Jesus Will Come Again">(December 2005) Jesus Will Come Again</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2005</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>The following is an edited version of an earlier Coloured Supplement. With regard to the "challenge" of the Second Coming and the "Final Judgment" including the judgment of believers see the sermon "Expecting His Return" (on Luke 19.11-27) preached by David Holloway on Sunday 27 November 2005 (9.30am/11.15am) - www.church.org.uk.</em></p><p>Christians recite in the Apostles' Creed, "He [Jesus] will come again to judge the living and the dead." This is a source of great hope for those who believe in Jesus Christ, but for non-believers it is a momentous challenge. </p><p>Christ, it is true, comes in a sense for every Christian at death. The Creed, however, speaks of a day when he will come publicly and at the end of history. However, because the biblical teaching on the "last things" has given rise to a number of strange ideas, many now neglect what the Bible teaches about the return of Christ. One respected theologian has complained over "the setting aside of the duty to preach the Second Coming and to stir the Church's longing in the Holy Spirit for that coming, a setting aside of duty largely caused by fear of its abuse." But the early Christians were so different. They were noted for their "waiting" confidently for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p><p><br><strong>Is it Believable?</strong></p><p>If you ask, "what did their contemporaries notice most about the early Christians?" the Apostle Paul gives you a very clear answer. He writes to the Thessalonian church that people were telling ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>... how you</em> [the Christians in Thessalonica] <em>turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead - Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath" </em>(1 Thess 1.9-10).</div></blockquote>
<p>These Christians were noted for two things. On the one hand they were known as people who served the true God and not false gods - presumably by seeking to be obedient to him both privately and publicly. On the other hand they were known as people who were "waiting for his Son from heaven".</p><p>Is such a "return", however, believable today in the 21st century? To answer that we must always distinguish what is believable from what is imaginable. Much that cannot be imagined can be believed. Certainly what is unimaginable to one generation is fully believable in the next. That has been true in recent times of space travel, of computerization, and of nanotechnology. Undoubtedly, even for believers, Christ's Second Coming has always been unimaginable in some ways. But our imagination cannot determine what is possible with God. Isaiah says in the Old Testament:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts,' declares the Lord" </em>(Isaiah 55.9).</div></blockquote>
<p>So what is to be believed about the Second Coming? One thing is this: at present Jesus, by his Holy Spirit, is invisibly present to millions and at the same time. But at some point in the future, when he comes again, in some way he will make himself visibly present to everybody. And the New Testament is emphatic that this will happen. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ is referred to about 300 times (on average once in every 15 verses) in the New Testament. That contrasts with the fact that Holy Communion is mentioned only on four clear occasions!</p><p><br><strong>What Will it be Like?</strong></p><p>How, then, are we to begin to imagine the Second Coming? One clue is given in the narrative of the Acts of the Apostles where it describes the Ascension of Jesus. We are told that "two men dressed in white" (presumably some sort of an angelic presence) said this, Acts 1.11:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>"But isn't all this only mythology?" someone asks. "No one can believe the Ascension today. Therefore, if the Second Coming is in some way a reversal of the Ascension, it, too, is only mythology." But why should the Ascension be <em>only</em> "mythology"? The early Christians certainly believed that Jesus had <em>really</em> ascended. Peter writes about Jesus as the one ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand - with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him" </em>(1 Pet 3.22).</div></blockquote>
<p>How could such a belief come about without the event recorded in Acts 1.9? That says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>he </em>[Jesus] <em>was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Nor, as some say, is that verse necessarily implying a "three-decker" universe. It is not at all clear that the New Testament authors were tying themselves to any particular cosmology. For example, Paul once spoke of being "caught up to the third heaven" when he was describing a visionary experience (2 Cor 12.2). But this was not a <em>journey</em> to another place in a distant part of the universe. Rather, in the context of the passage, it was a translation to a different <em>order</em> of existence.</p><p>The Ascension cannot be so easily dismissed. As a former Archbishop of Canterbury and distinguished biblical scholar, Michael Ramsey, put it: "there is nothing incredible in an event whereby Jesus assured the disciples that the [Resurrection] appearances were ended and that his sovereignty and his presence must henceforth be sought in new ways."</p><p>The Ascension seems to have been a decisive and deliberate withdrawal by Jesus from human sight; and there was something gradual about it. It was not like the sudden disappearance of Christ on the Emmaus Road. Some would find that easier to believe. As C.S.Lewis put it:</p>
<blockquote><div>if the spectators say they saw first a short vertical movement and then a vague luminosity (that is what 'cloud' presumably means here as it certainly does in the account of the Transfiguration) and then nothing - have we any reason to object?</div></blockquote>
<p>And "clouds", of course, feature in the Second Coming of Jesus.</p><p><br><strong>The <em>Parousia</em></strong></p><p>The "cloud" in the Bible was often a symbol of the divine presence. In the days of Moses a "cloud" was above the tent of meeting. It was a visible sign to Israel that the glory of the Lord was there (Ex 40.34). Also a "cloud" featured in the transfiguration of Jesus: "a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: 'This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!'" (Mk 9.7). So when Jesus described his own Second Coming as a "coming <em>in clouds</em> with great power and glory" (Mk 13.26), it would have been understood as referring to his own divine glory. </p><p>However, the Second Coming of Jesus will be more than just a "reversal" of the Ascension. The Ascension was private and seen just by Jesus' disciples. The Second Coming will be, as we have said, public. Revelation 1.7 says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And the Second Coming will not only be public and visible but also triumphant. The Greek word in the New Testament often used for the Second Coming is <em>Parousia</em>. That was an official term for the visit of a person of high rank, especially a king or emperor, visiting a province. Such a "picture" may well be behind "the trumpet" mentioned several times in the New Testament:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed - in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed" </em>(1 Cor 15.51).</div></blockquote>
<p>The trumpet suggests the heralding of a royal visitor or the noise that would go with a royal welcome. "But how helpful is this? There can't, surely, be a literal trumpet" asks another critic. </p><p><br><strong>Picture Language</strong></p><p>It needs to be remembered that this <em>is</em> "picture language" (or, more precisely, it is using analogies). We simply have to use picture language to talk not only about the Second Coming but also about the related subjects of life after death, judgment, Heaven and Hell. But that does not mean that what is referred to, or what stands behind that picture language, is not real and true.</p><p>Our human language and human concepts are designed for this world of space and time. To describe what happened at, before or beyond "the beginning" or "the end" requires such language (or analogies). That does not mean, however, we are describing a fantasy. </p><p>This language is describing something that is real. Christians have always been aware of that. So Augustine of Hippo (354 - 430 AD) writing about the fact that Christ is now seated at God's right hand in Heaven, says of this "sitting", "the expression indicates not a posture of the members, but judicial power, which majesty never fails to possess." </p><p>Augustine would never have been in doubt as to what Christ was now <em>really</em> doing. He knew that Christ <em>was</em> sitting at the right hand of God. Yes, he knew that he was using picture language. But he knew that this was a true fact and a reality.</p><p>It is the same with the Second Coming. Some picture language is required such as the "trumpet" and the "shout". But that does not affect the <em>reality</em> referred to. The reality of a situation or an event is not affected by the kind of language used to describe it. To be hesitant about the reality of what is claimed when using picture language is something like asking someone "what happens at dawn?" and they then reply: "I don't know; all I can do is use pre-Copernican picture language and say 'the sun rises.'"</p><p>That is not being clever. It is showing that someone does not know how to use language. <em>What</em> happens in the morning, is that the sun <em>does</em> rise. There is an objective event that happens for everyone in a given area. We may think that this pre-Copernican picture language can be misunderstood. Today we say that the earth goes round the sun and not vice-versa. But as we know, this picture language is usually capable of communicating, given our limitations - namely that we are on earth and not out in space. </p><p>Of course, we will have to wait for Christ's return before we see in detail in what ways the biblical picture language has been appropriate. Until then we simply have to allow it to capture our imaginations, while never forgetting that it is referring to a reality and an actual future event.</p><p><br><strong>The Events</strong></p><p>So Christ has promised to return. Therefore, we should not be embarrassed about taking his promise seriously. Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am</em> (John 14.3).</div></blockquote>
<p>This is a <em>personal</em> return. Whatever else it may or may not be, there will be a relationship established between Christ and all true believers; and salvation will be completed. It will be comparable to two parties meeting and "seeing" each other. It will not just be a "spiritual" event. So Paul says: "When Christ, who is your life, <em>appears</em>, then you also will appear with him in glory" (Col 3.4). Nor will Jesus only end history, raise the dead and judge the world. His Second Coming will also result in a reconstructed universe. Again Paul writes:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God</em> (Rom 8.18-21).</div></blockquote>
<p>What, however, is to happen between now and Christ's Second Coming? The New Testament talks about a range of happenings that can be embodied more than once. Nor do we have single identifiable dates, except possibly the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD (Lk 21.20). Among other things, and most importantly, Jesus says there will be the preaching of the gospel in the Gentile world (Mat 24:14). He also says there will be false prophets, false Christs and antichrists (Mat 24:5). And Paul says somehow Jews will be brought to faith in Christ (Rom 11:25-29); on the other hand there will be difficult times for believers, including the appearance of "the man of lawlessness":</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction" </em>(2 Thess 2.3).</div></blockquote>
<p>None of this, however, gives us grounds for predicting when events will happen and certainly not the date of Christ's return. Jesus said: "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father" (Mk 13.32). </p><p><br><strong>Down the Centuries</strong></p><p>Down the centuries Christians have said various things about this period between the two comings of Jesus. In the first century Jesus made it clear that he would return, but his coming could be delayed; so Christians might die first. That caused problems for some. The New Testament talks about "scoffers" who will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation" (2 Pet 3.4). The New Testament reply to that criticism was: "But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance" (2 Pet 3.8-9). God's time frame is not ours.</p><p>Then in the second and third centuries there were varied views among Christians about this period. Some straightforwardly believed in a final climax to world history with a general resurrection and judgment. Others spoke of an earthly reign of Jesus Christ for a 1000 years first (the "millennium" referred to in the book of Revelation chapter 20); this millennium would <em>follow</em> the Second Coming and happen <em>before</em> the "end".</p><p>In the fourth century Augustine argued that it made more sense of the Bible to interpret the "millennium" as already having begun. He thus equated the "millennium" with the whole age of the church. He believed, too, that the verses in Revelation that spoke of further manifestations of evil would be fulfilled at the close of the millennium. This Augustinian teaching then became mainstream. </p><p>Jumping the centuries to the 16th century, many of the Reformers believed that they were in the middle of a manifestation of evil and the final conflict because of their fight against the Pope. Some saw him as the "Anti-Christ". Since then others have been identified as the Anti-Christ – in modern times murderous dictators like Hitler, Stalin, and Pol-Pot. But it probably will never be possible to identify categorically any given historical figure as the Anti-Christ. Rather figures in history may need to be seen as embodying the symbolism of the book of Revelation. It is always an open question at any given time as to whether a contemporary Godless, anti-Christian tyrant who is persecuting the faithful is only a precursor to the final Anti-Christ or the Anti-Christ himself.</p><p><br><strong>"Watch!"</strong></p><p>Whatever is going to happen between the two Comings of Christ, the response Christians should have to the fact of Christ's return is simple. It is to <em>watch</em>. Here is Jesus teaching in Mark 13.32-37:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back - whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Nor does "watching" mean just waiting and doing nothing. First, we need to trust and follow Jesus Christ. Then there is clearly the need to watch out for opportunities of evangelism and service; but also, says Jesus, to watch out for temptation: "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation" (Mk 14.38). We should, indeed, live each day as if it were our last. If Christ returns and we are unprepared, he taught it would be a fearful disaster (Mat 24.36-51) (the return of Christ for those who are alive will have the same significance as death has for those who die before it happens). So Lord Shaftesbury in the 19th century tried consciously to remember the return of Christ everyday. It did not lead to an other-worldliness. Rather it was a motive for his remarkable humanitarian work. For him it helped in living a "holy and godly life". So let Peter have the last word:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives" </em>(2 Pet 3.10-11).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="The Sociology of Knowledge and Doubting the Christmas Story">(January 2006) The Sociology of Knowledge and Doubting the Christmas Story</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2006</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Sociology of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Ever since the evolution of the "sociology of knowledge" in Germany in the 1920's - popularized to the English-speaking world by Karl Mannheim - we have known that our social environment powerfully conditions beliefs. The sociology of knowledge is common sense. </p><p>The principle is simply that when, for example, post-modern intellectuals say that we must be open to this or that aberrant behaviour or new set of anti-Christian views, it is not just reason that dictates these new attitudes. There is a "plausibility structure" in place which means people are <em>conditioned</em> to feel that such new morality or new beliefs are reasonable. This "feeling" of reasonableness often has little to do with logic and much to do with social conditioning. Today this social conditioning is effected not least by education, the media and legal enactments.</p><p>This "common sense theory" seemed later to be supported by a psychological experiment - the Asch Experiment. Here a volunteer is told he (or she) is taking part in a visual perception test. What he doesn't know is that the other participants are actors and he is the only person taking part for real. This test is actually about group conformity. In the experiment the group (made up of actors and the one volunteer) are told that they will be tested regarding their perception of line length. Their task is simply to look at a line on the left of a screen and say which of the three lines on the right is equal to it in length. The actors have been told to match the wrong lines, with all the actors following the lead of the first actor. The volunteer is then monitored to see if he gives the correct answer or if he goes along with the opinion of the group and gives the wrong answer. In the experiment I saw (on film), in the first test the correct answer was line two. The first actor then said, "one", the second then said, "one" and the third said, "one". Then came the turn of the volunteer who paused and with surprise and hesitancy in his voice said, "two". Then the final actor said, "one". In the second test (with a different set of lines) again the correct answer was two. This time the first three actors said, "three"; and this time, after a long pause, the volunteer also said, "three", followed by the final actor saying "three". This was the comment on the experiment: "The Asch Experiment has been repeated many times and the results have been supported again and again. We will conform to the group. We are very social creatures. We are very much aware of what people around us think. We want to be liked. We do not want to be seen to rock the boat. So we will go along with the group. Even if we don't believe what people are saying, we still go along." </p><p>In terms of the sociology of knowledge, and with regard to moral beliefs, Peter Berger, the sociologist, expresses this as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>With the possible exception of a few areas of direct personal experience, human beings require social confirmation for their beliefs about reality. Thus the individual probably does not require others to convince him that he has a toothache, but he does require such social support for the whole range of his moral beliefs. Put differently, physical pain imposes its own plausibility without any social mediations, while morality requires particular social circumstances in order to become and remain plausible to the individual. It is precisely these social circumstances that constitute the plausibility structure for the morality at issue ... It follows from this that there is a direct relation between the cohesion of institutions and the subjective cohesiveness of beliefs, values and worldviews ... There are always exceptions - deviants or mavericks, individuals who maintain a view of the world and of themselves even in the absence of social support. These exceptions are always interesting, but they do not falsify the sociological generalization that human beliefs and values depend upon specific plausibility structures.</div></blockquote>
<p>The Asch Experiment suggests that if a large enough majority becomes too irrational, <em>any</em> belief - not just beliefs about morality - can be socially conditioned. Beliefs about hard facts can be distorted by a corrupt society. This seems to be happening at the moment; and it seems to be happening with regard to belief in the accounts of the birth of Jesus in the New Testament. Nor is this surprising. There is now enormous social pressure to de-Christianize Christmas. Sadly many Christians seem to be falling prey to this pressure. Michael Saward, a clergyman and writer, gives some alarming statistics.</p><p><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Doubts</strong></p><p>Michael Saward, however, begins with some ancient doubts:</p>
<blockquote><div>His name was Celsus and he didn't have much time for the Christian faith. He claimed that Jesus 'had invented his birth from a virgin,' a poor village girl 'turned out of doors by her husband, a carpenter ... because she was convicted of adultery and disgracefully gave birth to Jesus, an illegitimate child ... who proclaimed himself a God.' She had 'become pregnant by a Roman soldier, named Pantheras.' Not exactly in keeping with our Christian celebration of 'a virgin most pure,' who, 'as the prophets do tell, hath brought forth a baby.' What is clear, however, is that the claim to a virgin conception is very early and flatly rejects the extraordinary assertion of Karen Armstrong (an ex-Catholic nun, probably no longer a Christian) that it is a 'mythical expression of a religious truth' which is 'a late addition to the original story.</div></blockquote>
<p>This appeared in <em>The Church of England Newspape</em> just before Christmas (2005). An explanation could have been added that Celsus was a 2nd century pagan philosopher whom the early Christians decided was simply wrong. Be that as it may, Michael Saward was writing because he was disturbed at the amount of scepticism he has come across with regard to the virginal conception of Jesus. Nor is this just from modern pagans - the successors of Celsus - but from <em>within</em> so called Christian circles. Saward quoted a survey that led him to say this: "39 percent of Anglican evangelicals and 54 percent of Anglo-Catholics believe in the Virgin Birth. As the two groups most committed to the New Testament and Christian historical theology, these minimal figures are horrific. So when they say the Nicene Creed week by week, what do they mean?"</p><p>If the survey is accurate (and we were told it was by Peter Brierley of <em>Christian Research</em> which is normally reliable), first of all it shows that old labels, like "evangelical" and "Anglo-catholic" can be meaningless. Many may now feel they need to echo Lord Shaftesbury, the great evangelical layman and humanitarian reformer of the 19th century when he said: "I knew what constituted an Evangelical in former times. I have no clear notion what constitutes one now." We should not, however, be surprised at what is going on. It merely underlines the truth of assertions about the sociology of knowledge.</p><p>The early church, as in the case of Celsus, had to face similar questions and doubts. But after careful consideration they were agreed that Matthew and Luke had got things right and that the sceptics had got things wrong - <em>as a matter of fact</em>. The "church" then itself acted socially and institutionally to support that conclusion, not least by incorporating the facts into its creeds. But today in modern Europe, education and the media are now institutionally stronger than the church. So Charlie Moule, a New Testament Professor at Cambridge, has written about "a strangely perverse attitude." This is where people too readily accept what he calls "the latest irresponsible speculation by the journalistic charlatans." These are people who treat, in a cavalier fashion, the documents and evidence of the New Testament. When then doubts about the text of the Bible are continually being taught in our schools and broadcast in the media, unless you are one of Peter Berger's "mavericks" - those "individuals who maintain a view of the world and of themselves even in the absence of social support" - you will "go with the flow" before too long.</p><p><br><strong><em>Time</em> Magazine</strong></p><p>The Christmas 2004 (European) edition of <em>Time</em> magazine had as a cover story "<em>Secrets of the Nativity</em>". It was sceptical over the virgin birth, the visit of the wise men, and "Luke's description of an empire-wide census at the time of Jesus's birth, with Palestine's part conducted by the Syrian governor Quirinius." It said, "this seems inaccurate. There is no other record of a census in Palestine at the time, and Quirinius was not yet governor. But he did administer an infamous census on Augustus' behalf some 12 years later in AD 6 [Jesus' birth is often estimated to be in 6 BC]." Luke, the article suggests, was making this census fit in with the birth of Jesus to show that Christians were law abiding citizens and not revolutionaries. The tone of the article was seen in its doubts about Jesus' birth in Bethlehem and the suggestion that Herod's slaughter of the innocents of Bethlehem was not fact but introduced to parallel Pharaoh's murder of male Jews at the time of the Exodus. The article, however, admitted there were ...</p>
<blockquote><div>three responses among scholars. Traditionalists promote theories meshing Matthew's and Luke's versions. Says Paul L. Maier, a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University: 'Radical New Testament critics say it's a hopeless jumble. I myself do not think it's impossible to harmonize them.' Others champion one Gospel writer while discounting the other. A growing majority, however, conclude that there is simply not enough textual agreement to declare Bethlehem a historical given.</div></blockquote>
<p>Note the phrase "a growing majority" in that last sentence. This, of course, is difficult to prove. But whether true or false it generates "social (press) support" for a denial of the basic facts of the nativity story. What is interesting is that the conservative scholar interviewed was not a New Testament scholar but an ancient historian. Consistently you find that modern experts who approach the New Testament from the view point of secular ancient history find Luke (who records Jesus' birth) convincing. A.N.Sherwin-White, an Oxford Roman Historian, is amazed at the scepticism of some New Testament critics. Having examined the New Testament, especially Luke and Acts, from the view point of Roman law and culture he finds it remarkably reliable. Contrast that with the comment of one New Testament scholar <em>Time</em> quotes: "I do not see these stories as historical reports but as literary creations. As the latter, they are not history remembered but rather metaphorical narratives using ancient religious imagery to express central truths about Jesus' significance". So wrote Marcus Borg, from Oregon State University.</p><p>But if you are continually told through the Press, TV or Radio that there is a "growing majority" who disbelieve the New Testament documents as historical but just see them as poetic stories, before long you will believe these assertions of "experts". That will happen even though the sceptical arguments are not convincing. Such is the psychological pressure on human beings to conform. That is why you need to be in another environment where you have access to, and social support for, other knowledge - a "believing" church.</p><p><br><strong>Alternative Views</strong></p><p>But what can be said about some of the details regarding the nativity of Jesus that are regularly denied? Take the Star that Matthew said led the Wise Men to Bethlehem to "the place where the child was" (Matthew 2.9). Sceptics say this is simply a creation by Matthew from Numbers 24.17 where Balaam prophesies the rising of a star out of Jacob. That is hard to believe. </p><p>There, indeed, have been various theories about this Star. The pages of the <em>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society</em> make for more interesting reading than much that comes from Moule's "journalistic charlatans". Much goes back to 1603 and the great German Astronomer Johannes Kepler. He calculated that the "star" was the result of a new planetary object at the same time as a planetary conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. This theory was then revived in the modern period and dated at 7 BC. Others have claimed that the star is the Comet in Capricorn of 5 BC which was probably a nova. Yet others claim it is the Comet in Aquila, also a nova, and dated at 4 BC. But one of the most sophisticated papers on the Star from the quarterly journal is in vol 19 (1978) pp 517-520. It is by a distinguished Austrian astronomer, Konradin Ferrari d'Occhieppo. The summary of his paper is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>The original text of St Matthew's gospel (2.1-12), if understood literally with due regard to the general concepts and to the numerical results of the contemporary Babylonian astronomy, alludes to two definable and extremely distinguished stages of the great planetary conjunction in 7 BC. The appearance of the Star staying over where the child was can be fully explained by the intervention of the zodiacal light. Additional evidence for the planetary conjunction hypothesis (PCH) comes from a passage in the papyrus Bodmer V, MB.</div></blockquote>
<p>And in the text of his paper he concludes: "In my opinion, by the consistency of data resulting from Babylonian astronomical sources with St Matthew's report about the Star, the hypothesis of a legendary invention (myth) by Matthew is definitely excluded." Whatever the final truth and with Matthew no doubt seeing the symbolism of the events, there are certainly reasonable alternatives to the view that Matthew is simply mythical.</p><p>Then there is the issue of the Census that Luke refers to in chapter 2:1-3. Verse 2 says: "This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria." This was the reason Mary and Joseph had to leave their home town of Nazareth and make their way to Bethlehem. </p><p>We have independent evidence for a census - the Venetian Stone discovered in 1674. On it are the words: "On the orders of Quirinius I carried out the Census in Apamea, a city state of 117,000 citizens." But this Quirinius was the governor of Syria from AD 6 to AD 9. That is a decade <em>after</em> Jesus birth. So is Luke factually wrong? <em>Time</em> magazine thinks so. However, we know that censuses took years to complete. One in Gaul spread over four decades. It is quite possible that Augustus decreed the census earlier when Saturninus was governor of Syria, but that Quirinius completed it some years later. So one New Testament scholar translates it as "this enrolment [census] was before that made when Quirinius was governor of Syria." Others argue that Quirinius was possibly in office for two terms, first at the time of Christ's birth and then AD 6-9. If this was the "first" census, the "second" is referred to in Acts 5.37. The point is there are various ways of making sense of Luke's comment without having to dismiss it as fabrication for theological purposes.</p><p>And with regard to Herod and his brutality, it is surprising that anyone could doubt the "slaughter of the innocents." As R.T.France writes in his Tyndale New Testament Commentary on Matthew 2.16: "The ruthlessness of Herod's later years, particularly where a potential rival was concerned, is well documented." For example, Josephus the 1st century Jewish historian writes: "he was a man who was cruel to all alike and one who easily gave in to anger and was contemptuous of justice." </p><p><br><strong>The Virginal Conception</strong></p><p>Finally with regard to the virginal conception itself, let me repeat six key considerations we must never forget.</p><p><em>First</em>, the starting point is the Gospel narratives themselves. Matthew and Luke both have the same central core - namely that Mary remained bodily a Virgin in the conception of Jesus and did not have intercourse with Joseph. Yet both evangelists clearly were drawing on very different sources for their information. Few, therefore, would deny the following: "that a virginal conception through the power of the Holy Spirit is one of the few points on which they agree and that this tradition antedated both accounts (Raymond E. Brown - a [fairly liberal] New Testament scholar). The story of the Virgin Birth goes right back to the earliest period. Indeed, the infancy narratives are clearly of Palestinian origin. They reflect Jewish fears of Herod the Great and Jewish piety centred on temple worship in Jerusalem. The traditional view is that the ultimate source of the narratives is the holy family - Joseph for Matthew and Mary for Luke. We must also remember that James, Jesus's brother, became head of the church at Jerusalem. He was, therefore, in a position to correct any Palestinian traditions where they were obviously untrue.</p><p><em>Secondly</em>, the claim that "virgin births" are common in other religious literature has to be challenged. For religious literature mostly has accounts of "holy marriage". Here a "god" in human or superhuman form sexually impregnates a woman. But that is quite unlike the accounts of the virginal conception in the Gospels.</p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, the story of the Virgin Birth cannot simply be dismissed as a midrash - and for this reason. In Judaism a midrash was essentially a commentary on a passage of Old Testament scripture which then "took off". The midrashist had a text in front of him which he elaborated often in a most fanciful way. But the text was the starting point. However, Matthew clearly is not starting with a text. He has a series of traditions about the birth and childhood of Jesus. Into these he weaves scriptural references. He is not adapting the narratives to fit [Old Testament] scripture. If anything he is adapting scripture to fit the narratives. The quotation in Matthew 2.23 ("he will be called a Nazarene") is a very drastic adaptation - it has no known reference! Matthew is not taking Old Testament texts and then writing myths to fit. If he were doing that he would have chosen more evocative sections of the Old Testament. And, from contemporary Jewish practice we know that basic events were never concocted out of texts. The Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran show how texts are made to fit contemporary events and not vice-versa. There always was a substratum of fact. Even the critic must admit that Matthew started with the basic outline of the infancy narrative.</p><p><em>Fourthly</em>, Luke himself tells us that he was interested in the truth - "it seemed good to me ... to write an orderly account ... that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught" (Luke 1.3-4). Even if contemporary Jews had a more cavalier approach to history writing, there is every reason for thinking that the early Christians had a very different attitude to history. That was because other Jews located the saving events of God in the distant past; or, if they were of an apocalyptic turn of mind, in the future; but the early Christians said they were located in the recent past. Hence we must presuppose they had an interest in what actually happened.</p><p><em>Fifthly</em>, the Old Testament said the Messiah would be born of David's line. The New Testament makes it clear that Jesus was believed to be the Messiah. Why then invent an untrue story that separates Joseph (of David's line) from the process of conception?</p><p><em>Sixthly</em>, if Mary had not been a virgin, no one would have created a myth to suggest she was a great example of obedience. The strict moral climate of the day would have classed her fornication as highly disobedient.</p><p><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Those are some of the considerations that give us confidence in the New Testament and in the teaching of Christians down the centuries as it is summarised in the Creeds. As we say so regularly, "He [Jesus] was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary." The virginal conception was a supernatural miracle. It confirmed the fact that Jesus is, indeed, God incarnate - fully man, but without sin.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="William Carey - Getting the Gospel Out">(February 2006) William Carey - Getting the Gospel Out</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2006</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p>William Carey, born in 1761 was a baptist shoemaker. According to Timothy George's biography <em>Faithful Witness - the life and mission of William Carey</em> (IVP 1992), he is "universally recognized as the father of modern missions." Nearly 32 years of age, in 1793 William Carey set out from England for India inaugurating the modern period of world mission. For the next 41 years he lived and worked in India and never saw England again, dying in 1834. So what lessons has William Carey for us as we now face a missionary situation in the West generally and in Britain in particular? Here are three out of many.</p><p><br><strong>Good People can be Wrong</strong></p><p><em>First</em>, Carey believed that good people could be wrong. Bishop Ryle, another church leader from a previous century - this time from the second half of the 19th century - was also clear on this. Ryle said: "great ministers may make great mistakes". He cited the apostle Paul publicly criticizing the apostle Peter when he "withstood him to his face" in Antioch because Peter gave in to the Judaizers (Gal 2. 11-16). Ryle says, "Peter, without doubt, was one of the greatest in the company of the apostles … and yet here this very Peter ... plainly falls into a great mistake." Ryle goes on to say, "it is all meant to teach us that the apostles themselves, when not writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, were at times liable to err." So were believers in Old Testament times liable to err and so have been believers in post-apostolic church history:</p>
<blockquote><div>The early fathers were zealous according to their knowledge and ready to die for Christ. But ... nearly all sowed the seeds of many superstitions. The Reformers were honoured instruments in the hand of God for reviving the cause of truth on earth. Yet hardly one of them can be named who did not make some great mistake.</div></blockquote>
<p>Ryle concluded: "We are far too ready to think, that because some great minister or some learned man says a thing - or because our own minister, whom we love, says a thing - it must be right, without examining whether it is in Scripture or not." For Carey's part he seems to have been worried about one of the things the Reformers said and which others had followed. Carey saw this as leading to a resistance to mission. For in Europe there had been (and still is) a tradition against "going out" to evangelise. But how can this be when you think about the Great Commission of Jesus at the end of Matthew's gospel? The risen Jesus Christ is there reported as saying:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" </em>(Mat 28.18-20).</div></blockquote>
<p>The answer is that many in Europe at this time did not think the Commission any longer relevant. They thought it was binding only on the apostles. </p><p><br><strong>Luther and Calvin</strong></p><p>Here is Luther writing two centuries earlier: "that the apostles entered strange houses and preached was because they had a command and were for this purpose appointed, called and sent, namely that they should preach everywhere, as Christ had said, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.' After that, however, no one again received such a general apostolic command, but every bishop or pastor has his own particular parish." And here is Calvin in his commentary on 1 Corinthians 12.28:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For the Lord created the apostles, that they might spread the gospel throughout the whole world, and he did not assign to each of them certain limits or parishes, but would have them, wherever they went, to discharge the office of ambassadors among all nations and languages. In this respect there is a difference between them and pastors, who are, in a manner, tied to their particular churches. For the pastor has not a commission to preach the gospel over the whole world, but to take care of the church that has been committed to his charge.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Of course, these men believed the gospel should spread somehow. Indeed, they saw the ripple effect of persecution and dispersal. As people were persecuted, Christians would share their faith in new situations. But there was no planned strategy for the conversion of men and women through "going out". Christian workers were confined to their parishes. So when Wesley treated "the world as his parish" and went around Britain preaching and evangelizing in other people's parishes, we can understand the opposition.</p><p><br><strong>30 May 1792</strong></p><p>However, then came William Carey. On 30 May 1792 he was preaching to a group of ministers in Nottingham. He challenged them with this slogan: "<em>expect great things (from God); attempt great things (for God)</em>." That was a catalyst for an amazing century and a half of Christian missionary work. For he then in the same year (1792) published his booklet, <em>An enquiry into the obligations of Christians to use means for the conversion of the heathen</em>. He referred in it to the Great Commission of Jesus to go into all the world making disciples. The first section of Carey's booklet was entitled, "An Enquiry whether the Commission given by our Lord to his disciples be not still binding on us." Carey was horrified at the lack of zeal and concern for the pagan world in his own generation. So he took direct issue with ...</p>
<blockquote><div>… an opinion existing in the minds of some, that because the apostles were extraordinary officers and have no proper successors, and because many things which were right for them to do would be unwarranted for us, therefore it may not be immediately binding on us to execute the Commission, though it was so upon them.</div></blockquote>
<p>Carey was insistent. Christ's command was as binding on men in his day as it was on the apostles in their day. Otherwise the command to baptize should be seen as restricted to the apostles, and the promise of the presence of Jesus "to the very end of the age" should also not apply to us. This legacy of "non-evangelism" is, it seems, still with us and is deep-rooted in Europe.</p><p><br><strong>The Holy Spirit uses "Means"</strong></p><p><em>Secondly</em>, William Carey realized that Christians do have to take initiatives in evangelism. He believed in the use of "means". The title of his little booklet was "An enquiry into the obligations of Christians to use means for the conversion of the heathen." Christians do have to plan, think and strategize for getting the gospel out. Some people think that all you have to do in an age of confusion and denial, is simply "preach the truth". That is vital, absolutely necessary and non-negotiable. But it is obvious from the Acts of the Apostles that Paul was led by the Holy Spirit to be strategic as well as faithful. He went, for example, to key urban areas to start his mission work. He realized that he had to plan for getting his message heard. So we today, as it is put in our JPC foundation document, not only have to "maintain" but also to "promulgate" biblical and evangelical truth. It is possible to be so committed to "maintaining" the truth against error that you never "promulgate" it and end up with a dead orthodoxy. Equally, if you spend all your energies in planning the promulgation without maintenance of the truth, you can find yourself before long with nothing to preach except a religious version of political correctness. Carey both maintained and promulgated the truth of God's word; and he used "means" in his obedience. He did not just sit back passively waiting for something to happen.</p><p><strong>Risking Prison</strong></p><p><em>Thirdly</em>, Carey upheld the law but when necessary risked prison by breaking the rules - the rules when the local authorities were forbidding evangelism. The East India Company had authority in India at the end of the 18th century. But they did not want missionaries evangelizing local Indians. They seem to have thought that this might upset the Indians and be bad for business! Carey, therefore, had to enter India as an "illegal alien". Let me give you the account from Timothy George's biography of Carey of his arrival in India after many months at sea:</p>
<blockquote><div>Every one on board was anxious for landfall. Yet no one in the missionary party had a permit to enter the country. Before disembarking the commander of every vessel was required to submit an affidavit stating that he carried no contraband or unlicensed passengers. To avoid this danger, the missionaries, with the connivance of Captain Christmas, transferred to a small fishing boat, called a <em>pansi</em>, which carried them from the mouth of the estuary up the Hooghly River towards Calcutta. On November 14 the <em>Calcutta Gazette</em> announced the arrival of the <em>Kron Princessa Maria</em>, her only cargo, "Sundries." Three days before, the missionaries had slipped into the vast city unnoticed and unmolested by the company officials.</div></blockquote>
<p>So began an amazing period of church growth and world evangelism not only through Carey's work (in particular as a linguist) in India but as others followed his example. Carey made mistakes (as good men do). God, however, used him in remarkable ways. How we should thank God, therefore, for his life and his strategy of "first pray then use means" to get the gospel out.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Cartoons, Nigeria and Shari'ah">(March 2006) The Cartoons, Nigeria and Shari'ah</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2006</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The cartoons</strong></p>
<p>Nigeria is important for the Anglican Communion. It has the largest church in the Communion with 17,000,000 members. Recently, however, Anglican and other Christians in Nigeria have been suffering serious attacks. These were in riots following the publication of cartoons featuring Mohammed in a Danish paper on 30 September 2005. One showed the founder of Islam wearing a headdress shaped like a grenade. In another he was saying that paradise was running short of virgins for Muslim suicide bombers. Three weeks later, on 20 October, Muslim ambassadors complained to the Danish Prime Minister saying they found these cartoons offensive. Three months later, on 10 January, a Norwegian publication reprinted the cartoons.</p><p>There then followed the extreme action that took many people by surprise. May be there was some orchestration; for many young Muslims, regular internet browsing was probably a sufficient stimulus to action. On 26 January 2006 Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador. On 31 January the Danish paper apologized. But on 1 February papers in France, Germany, Italy and Spain reprinted the cartoons. On 4 February Syrians attacked the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus. On 5 February protesters destroyed the Danish embassy in Beirut. And in Nigeria, on 6 February in the northern majority Muslim state of Kano, Nigerian MPs cheered as Danish and Norwegian flags were burned in a ceremony in the parliament premises. The secretary general of the Christian Association of Nigeria, the Revd Joseph John Hayep, added his voice to calm things. He said the publication was totally uncalled for at a time when the world was looking for unity. Nigeria is a nation where there has been very serious Muslim - Christian tension. But this was to no avail.</p><p>For there were reports that during the weekend of the 19 February 16-25 people were killed in northern Nigeria during protests by Muslims over these cartoons. Most of the deaths occurred in rioting in Maiduguri, the capital of the north-eastern Borno State; and witnesses said most were from Maiduguri's minority Christians. The BBC reported that these were the first violent protests in the country and led to eleven churches being torched and Christian businesses being targeted. Later reports said that 36 churches were burnt in Maiduguri alone. The <em>Church Times</em> reported that a Roman Catholic priest died with all his staff when his home was burned down. The Roman Catholic Bishop's residence was also set alight. Maiduguri was normally a quiet place, but Christians were worried when they heard over the radio there was going to be a demonstration in the state against the cartoons. The attacks on Christian places of worship, however, were seen as a culmination of several years of persecution at the hands of the Muslim dominated Borno State government. One clergyman said: "for the past thirty years, no Christian has been given the certificate of occupancy to build any church in this state ... Christianity has always been under attack. The only difference is that it has not been to the extent of burning churches."</p><p>From a distance it is hard to know exactly what has been going on in Nigeria. In the South of Nigeria there have been terrible reprisals by violent youths on the Muslim community in Onitsha with 80 reported killed. Christian leaders have condemned these reprisals saying, "our faith does not accept such retaliatory actions;" and they told Christians to remain calm and law-abiding.</p><p><br><strong>Bishop Ben Kwashi</strong></p><p>The secular media gave full coverage to the terrible things going on in Onitsha, which must be stopped and the culprits punished. But some of the reports failed to highlight the fact that the violence all began with Muslims attacking Christians in the North. One attack concerned the wife of someone I have known through <em>REFORM</em> and who was visiting England in February - Bishop Ben Kwashi. Rachel Harden reported in the <em>Church Times</em> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>Gloria Kwashi, the wife of the Bishop of Jos, in northern Nigeria, was rushed to an intensive-care unit after being attacked and tortured in her home at the weekend by a gang looking for her husband. The attack is believed to be part of the persecution of Christians in Nigeria, which has been re-ignited in the wake of the publication in Europe of cartoons caricaturing Mohammed.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>The Bishop, Dr Benjamin Kwashi, who was in the UK when the attack took place, returned home without delay, and called for immediate 'intervention, assistance, and protection' from the Nigerian police. In a letter to the Inspector General of Police in Abuja, Dr Kwashi wrote: 'They got everybody under their control and any little move was met with severe and brutal beatings resulting in injuries. As a result, my first son, Rinji (aged 19 years), was beaten to the point of unconsciousness. Nanminen, our last son (seven years) was also severely injured on his face. Morris, our gateman, was injured in the face.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>The attackers, who demanded to know the Bishop's whereabouts, then singled out Mrs Kwashi. 'She was taken to the bedroom, where she was undressed naked and severely beaten. They tortured her to produce me, and they made their demand very clear, asking where I, Bishop Kwashi, CAN (Christian Association of Nigeria) chairman, was. She told them that I was not CAN chairman, and that I was not around,' the Bishop said. After the attack, she was marched naked three kilometres to the diocesan office, where she was forced to hand over money. After attacking staff members at the diocesan headquarters, the assailants fled, and the alarm was raised. Mrs Kwashi was admitted to hospital with serious injuries to her back, hips, head, and other areas. Dr Kwashi said he was appealing for help and protection for his family and staff after the 'apparent and imminent threat to my life and to the lives of my family'.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>Baroness Cox, a close friend of the family, said on Tuesday that she was in no doubt that the attack was linked to anti-Christian protests in other parts of Nigeria. She said that the family was recovering, but that Mrs Kwashi was still seriously ill, and there were 'very serious concerns' about future safety and the targeting of Christians. 'I have written already to a government minister expressing my concern, as this is not the first attack on Bishop Kwashi and his home,' Lady Cox said. Dr Kwashi was in England at the time of the attack for a meeting of Sharing of Ministries Abroad (SOMA) International, of which he is chairman. A statement from SOMA on Wednesday said that after two operations Mrs Kwashi had been moved out of intensive care, and that the surgery she had undergone had been successful.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Shari'ah law</strong></p><p>Tensions have risen in the north of Nigeria since the introduction of Shari'ah Law in 1995. Shari'ah law, however, seems to vary. Paul Marshall, the editor of <em>Radical Islam's Rules: The World-wide Spread of Extreme</em> Shari'ah <em>Law</em>, argues (<em>Christianity Today</em> February 2006) that Shari'ah can be extreme as in Saudi Arabia, Iran or Pakistan, with people getting stoned for adultery and with vicious blasphemy laws; but in places like Indonesia Shari'ah has been less extreme. However, for all the modernizing tendencies, most Muslims live in Africa and Asia where many cannot read the Koran and so their views on Islam are unformed. This gives conservative Muslim teachers an opportunity to teach the Koran in their own way. So in countries like Bangladesh or Indonesia where Islam has been historically more moderate, change is now happening for the worse. Islamic teachers from the Gulf, and funded by Saudi Arabia, have moved in, built mosques and provided imams and scholarships. Populations that were more or less theologically illiterate are now getting schooled in fundamentalist Islam.</p><p>In 1975, only one major country practised Shari'ah as we understand it - Saudi Arabia. Then in 1979 the Ayatollah Khomeini introduced Shari'ah to Iran, but with differences. Iran is Shiite while Saudi Arabia is Sunni. "But," says Paul Marshall, "in terms of the <em>hudud</em> laws, the criminal laws, which involve amputation, crucifixion, stoning and so on, they're very similar in outlook. In both cases, the status of women is very, very poor. The status of minorities is very, very poor." Then there is Pakistan. This has seen the gradual growth and increase of Shari'ah law, with severe blasphemy laws for anyone insulting Allah, the Koran, or Mohammed. The Sudan has been very extreme. "It executed people who opposed these laws on the grounds that opposing its type of Shari'ah was itself against Shari'ah ... In Chechnya, southern Russia, rebels have been trying to imitate the Sudanese legal code." That brings us to Nigeria. In 1995 the State of Zamfara instituted Shari'ah. Of 36 States in the country, 12 now have Shari'ah law on the books. "Some are more severe than others. But essentially," says Marshall, "this has happened right across the northern swath of Nigeria, and there's increased pressure in the central areas of Nigeria." </p><p>All of this is very serious for Christians in these countries, including Nigeria. So how should we respond? Hebrews 12.4 says: "In your struggle against sin, <em>you</em> have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood." But then Hebrews 13.3 says: "Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow-prisoners, and those who are ill-treated as if you yourselves were suffering." May we do that as we also pray for these persecuted Christians (and others) and help as we can, while making public their condition. Above all pray for a work of the Holy Spirit to convict and convert Muslims world-wide to Jesus Christ who alone is "the way and the truth and the life" (John 14.6).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Jerry Springer the Opera">(April 2006) Jerry Springer the Opera</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2006</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Blasphemy</strong></p>
<p>During Holy Week (April 9-15) we will be reminded of what happened when Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane. As recorded in Mark's Gospel, Jesus was taken before the chief priests and the Jewish court of the Sanhedrin and interrogated. We read:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, 'Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?' 'I am,' said Jesus. 'And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.' The high priest tore his clothes. 'Why do we need any more witnesses?' he asked. You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?' They all condemned him as worthy of death" </em>(Mark 14.61-64).</div></blockquote>
<p>Jesus was crucified on a charge of "blasphemy". But to charge Jesus with "blasphemy" was the worst of all blasphemies (see Mark 3.28-29)!</p><p>Blasphemy came into the headlines again in the modern period in 1987 with Salman Rushdie and his novel <em>The Satanic Verses</em>. The novel was offensive to Muslims and earned him a <em>fatwa</em> and the threat of murder from Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. With the pressure off, Salman Rushdie has reflected on, and written about, the issues involved. As a defiant secular humanist from a Muslim background he follows John Stuart Mill and cites Socrates and Christ as men accused of blasphemy who were founders of Western traditions. He says: "We can say, therefore, that blasphemy and heresy, far from being the greatest evils, are methods by which human thought has made its most vital advances." Rushdie, however, fails to see that blasphemy can also be a "regression". </p><p>It is this blasphemous "pushing the frontiers" that is planned for Newcastle upon Tyne before the next Coloured Supplement is due. For unless the show is cancelled, <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em>, the "award-winning blasphemy musical" (to quote its director, Stewart Lee), will have been staged at the <em>Theatre Royal</em> from Monday 1 May 2006 to Saturday 6 May 2006. </p><p>Many have now seen the show because of its being broadcast in January 2005 on BBC2. And it is blasphemous. This is the verdict of theatre critics. Then in the House of Commons David Taylor, the Labour MP, said: "Anyone who saw that programme will have been dismayed by its unremittingly juvenile, offensive and blasphemous content." Lord Rees-Mogg, former Editor of <em>The Times</em> and Chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council from 1989-1994, also said it was blasphemous: "I do not doubt that <em>Jerry Springer, The Opera</em> breaches the existing law on blasphemy ... At present the BBC is afraid of Islam, but feels completely free to mock Christianity." And referring to the literally hundreds upon hundreds of utterances of the "f" word, Rees-Mogg said: "'F. you all' is the agenda of nihilism. The idea that there is no wrong and no right implies moral anarchy, or moral dementia." He was referring to one of the final lyrics entitled the "Marriage of Heaven and Hell." This includes the lines, "Energy is pure delight, nothing is wrong and nothing is right."</p><p><br><strong>The Broader Issues and Legality</strong></p><p>Lord Rees-Mogg, however, said that "this is not primarily an issue of legality ... the question is, I think, a broader one." So what is at stake in "blasphemy"? I have written before at what has been called a "loss of outrage" in the post-modern West. All societies make a distinction between the "sacred" and the "profane" or what is taboo and what is common. What do people feel is serious or unimportant? What do they show reverence or respect for? And what do they treat with indifference? When you ask those questions in the light of <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em> you can see that a number of people are wanting to invert the traditional answers the majority have given, and I believe still give, in Britain to those questions. In the words of Isaiah they "call evil good and good evil" (5.20). Undoubtedly today that inversion is not for an abstract desire for "freedom of speech" but from an aggressive strategy for moral change. Like Rushdie, blasphemy is seen by a subversive minority as a "method of advance". It does not, however, proceed by civilized rational debate but more by power and force that is acquired by significant public funding. What else is "pushing the frontiers"?</p><p>There is, it needs to be noted, a distinction between our current understanding of "blasphemy" and "heresy". Heresy has to do with the "matter" of what is said. Blasphemy has to do with the "manner" in which it is said. The classical definition of blasphemy, quoted in the last successful blasphemy prosecution in 1977, is as follows: "every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ, or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England as by law established. It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion, or to deny the existence of God, if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language. The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not the substance of the doctrine themselves." A very recent definition of the English common law offence of blasphemy was given by Professor D.J.Feldman to the Select Committee of the House of Lords on Religious Offences in England and Wales that reported in 2003. He said that from the decided cases it would seem that blasphemy is committed "... by anyone who makes public words, pictures or conduct whereby doctrines, beliefs, institutions, or sacred objects and rituals of the Church of England by law established are denied or scurrilously vilified or there is objectively contumelious, violent or ribald conduct or abuse directed towards the sacred subject in question, <em>likely to shock and outrage the feelings of the general body of Church England believers in the community</em>." I submit that the general body of Church of England believers, if they saw the video of <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em>, would be shocked and outraged.</p><p><br><strong>The Christian Institute's Summary</strong></p><p>In the words of the distinguished American commentator, Richard Neuhaus, when talking about an offensive blasphemous production in New York, "my apologies for bringing such swill to your attention." But these are very important issues. There is now available a clear little leaflet produced by <em>The Christian Institute</em>. It is under the heading, "<em>Jerry Springer the Opera is a prejudiced, anti-Christian hate show</em>"; and it is a fair summary of the characterization in the third Act. It correctly reports that ...</p>
<blockquote><div>Jesus Christ is introduced to the show as, 'the hypocrite son of the fascist tyrant on high - Jesus of Nazareth'. He is presented as a reflection of a character from earlier in the show who likes to wear nappies and gets sexual pleasure from defecating in them. Christ declares himself to be 'a bit gay'. He hits a woman and uses foul language. He replies to Satan's accusations by saying, 'I'm Jesus, son of Man, son of Mary, son of God, so do not f*** with me'. He says to Eve, 'You're weeping now, but you didn't give a t*** when I was crying out on the cross.' At the end of the show Jerry Springer turns to Jesus and blasphemously says, 'grow up, for Christ's sake, and put some f****** clothes on.</div></blockquote>
<p>Then God the Father "is presented as a reflection of an over-weight bisexual from earlier in the show. God the Father sings 'It ain't easy being me' and asks Jerry Springer, 'sit in heaven beside me, hold my hand and guide me, 'cos it ain't easy being me'. At the end of the show Jerry turns to God the Father and tells him that he has to learn that he won't have a shoulder to cry on."</p><p>The virgin Mary "enters the show with the chorus singing 'raped by God'. Mary accuses Jesus of dying young and not being there for her. A song then ensues where Mary sings to Jesus 'Where were you when the condom split?'" As for Satan, he "demands 'a f****** apology' from God for throwing him out of Heaven and orders Jerry Springer to obtain it for him. Satan bellows at Jesus over the course of several minutes nothing but 'f*** you'." Then Eve "thrusts a hand under Jesus' loin cloth and fondles him as she sings about the Garden of Eden. A fight then breaks out between Jesus and Eve. Jesus strikes Eve across the face. The chorus sings 'What the f***?' Jerry Springer then intervenes and reprimands Jesus for hitting a woman."</p><p><br><strong>Observations</strong></p><p>Let me make some observations. First, there will be those who say, with some reason, that those making the running in opposition to <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em> have been rather shrill and on occasion unwise. Secondly, there will be those who say, with probably less reason, that actually the law cannot stop such a production, so live and let live. But even if Stewart Lee and the Theatre Royal have a legal right to offend Christians, they do not have a moral right to do so. Hate speech - and this is "hate speech" against Christians - is hate speech. And to quote the American Catholic League, "it doesn't become something less if dressed up in artistic clothing." There is an assumption that elegance and sophistication justifies anything. Yes, the music in <em>Jerry Springer</em> is musically good. But mouthing the "f" word hundreds of times to the strains of high opera doesn't alter the words nor prevent the cumulative effect of the performance being blasphemous. Yes, there is a moral message and legitimacy in "sending up" the real Jerry Springer and his dreadful "reality" TV show. But the whole is like a cup of coffee. Much of it may be good, but even a tiny drop of poison in the cup can kill you. In <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em>, however, the poison is significantly more than a tiny drop. </p><p>There must be free speech. But our democratic tradition of basic free speech began in 1694 when Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act and prepublication censorship came to an end. Macaulay described that as a greater contribution to liberty and civilization than either the Magna Carta or the Bill of Rights. But publications were still subject to the laws of the land regarding sedition, blasphemy, obscenity and libel. Ideas were free. What was wanted was a free market for ideas and rational, civilized discourse (not for blasphemy or obscenity - the two often go together).</p><p><br><strong>Public Opinion</strong></p><p>There, indeed, are still taboos regarding what people think important or sacred in modern Britain. A minority, however, have decided unilaterally to destroy a number of those taboos. Interestingly the Select Committee of the House of Lords on Religious Offences in 2003 said this:</p>
<blockquote><div>In the recent census, 72 percent of the returns declared themselves to be part of the Christian tradition and identity. While not regular churchgoers, many still turn to the Christian churches at key times in the Christian year, and at important moments in their own life cycle, as well as occasions of local or national thanksgiving or tragedy. They are, in overwhelming majority, people who are tolerant of the practice of other religions and would wish to see that tolerance and protection reflected in our law and practice. They believe also in the hard-won heritage of free speech in our society. Many could feel a real sense of loss, which might easily be turned to anger, if the delicate balance of religious and secular, the 'sacred canopy' of our nation, were to be destroyed ... It is worth noting, too, that most Muslim groups, while preferring that the law be extended to cover all faiths, are opposed to the repeal of the law of blasphemy. The Muslim Council of Britain, for example, said that 'abolishing the law on blasphemy would mean so far as other faiths are concerned what we call negative equalization'; one of the proforma letters we received said that 'from a Muslim perspective, it is better for the law to protect at least one religious denomination from blasphemy, the Anglican Church, than no religion at all.' The Board of Deputies of British Jews believes that to extend the law to other faiths would 'raise inherent contradictions' and that 'it should be retained as it is'.</div></blockquote>
<p>The Select Committee advised that the law be neither repealed nor extended, but remain as it is. So the law of blasphemy still stands with its reference to the Church of England. </p><p>It is recognised that western democracies – at least in Britain and America - are not pluralistic in an ultimate sense. Rather they have a subordinate pluralism, which our blasphemy law reflects. It can be argued this is due to the Christian tradition. That gives a clear distinction, from the teaching of Jesus, between God and Caesar. So it is distinct from Islam where fundamentalist Islam denies Caesar, and distinct from secular humanism which denies God. But the mainstream Christian political tradition has learnt the lessons of history. It understands the doctrine of Hell as meaning that God allows free choice. So the Christian political tradition allows non-Christian faiths in ways that Islam does not, nor does secular humanism in its "true believing form" which is atheism (witness the 20th century Stalinist and Marxist regimes). This genuinely liberal Christian tradition now has a strong belief that the State <em>may not enforce beliefs</em>. That also contrasts with much of Islam and, indeed, secular humanism which more and more is becoming the religion or "faith" of the media, the educational establishment and the therapeutic services.</p><p><br><strong>The "f" Word</strong></p><p>The publicly subsidized production of <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em> seems to be part of what some have called a "culture war". As Christians in a democracy, and therefore, with a measure of authority ourselves, surely we should pray and take peaceful action to preserve the good order of society and oppose such initiatives. We are to pray for those "in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness" (1 Timothy 2.2). The "opera" is certainly neither godly nor holy! Yes, blasphemy is a relative notion. In the West it is a moderate notion. In Islam, as we saw with the recent Danish "Cartoons", blasphemy is something extreme and results in death - as it did with the Jewish Sanhedrin at the time of Christ. For Christians to tolerate blasphemy, it can be still argued (as it used to be), is to tolerate a destabilization of society. Some will think that extreme. Let me explain. </p><p>There is a performative use of language. This is seen in the obscenity, or indecency, such as was evident in the first Act of <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em> where there is an ad nauseam use of the "f" word. But what is really so wrong with the "f" word? Why was there such an uproar when Kenneth Tynan uttered it for the first time on the BBC in 1965 during a live debate? Why did it cause such an uproar at the BBC and in Parliament? Why did it cut short Tynan's TV career? Why should it be shocking to say publicly "Brian f***ed Janet," but not shocking to say, "Brian made love to Janet?" What is wrong with the public use of an old 16th century word of unknown derivation?</p><p>It is the same question that can be asked with regard to some other changes of language. Peter Berger, the sociologist, once explained what is happening by reference to the fascist leader, Mussolini and the fact that in some European languages, there is a distinction between "you" singular, and "you" plural.</p>
<blockquote><div>In modern Italian the intimate form of address is <em>tu</em>, while more distant individuals are addressed as <em>lei</em> (which happens to be the third person plural). Sometime in the 1930s Mussolini made a speech in which he castigated the use of <em>lei</em> as an effete, indeed effeminate mode of language. The purpose of the Fascist revolution, he said, was to restore vigour and virility to the Italian people. The good Fascist was direct in language as in action. The good Fascist, therefore, did not say <em>lei</em>; instead, he said <em>voi</em> (the second person plural). Now, from a philological or semantic point of view, this was sheer nonsense. The use of <em>lei</em> had never struck anyone as effete or effeminate; it was, quite simply, standard Italian. But, needless to say, the situation changed dramatically after Mussolini's speech. From then on, everyone became highly conscious of the matter ... The use of <em>lei</em> became a sign of reactionary, perhaps even subversive, attitudes. The use of <em>voi</em>, preferably in a self-righteous and highly audible manner, was evidence that the speaker (or writer) was a Fascist in good standing. Indeed, it became the verbal equivalent of the Fascist salute. Put simply what before Mussolini's pronouncement had been an apolitical and unreflective element of the common language now forced itself on everyone's consciousness as a highly political symbol.</div></blockquote>
<p><br><strong>Protest!</strong></p><p>The fact is that language is not just an instrumental vehicle of communication between human beings; it also has "symbolic freight". To use the "f" word is not just to communicate an action but to buy into a sexual revolution and ideology that says modern society needs little sexual restraint. This undoubtedly has resulted in misery for millions in terms of the traumas of marriage breakdowns, children suffering and society at large being damaged. Tynan actually helped generate and motor that revolution by unilaterally breaking a taboo and abusing, in front of millions, the privilege of a TV studio.</p><p>The same is true of <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em>. To allow the blasphemy is not to be seen as allowing free speech but allowing people to use a public facility - <em>The Theatre Royal</em> - seemingly to promote a culture of blasphemous religious hatred. Newcastle City Council is the owner of the Theatre Royal. In the last year for which figures are available, the theatre received, as I understand it, over £650,000 of council tax-payers' money. Of the 12 Trustees of the theatre, 7 are Newcastle City Councillors. I suspect many of them do not realize what the show is like. Already <em>Tesco's</em> and <em>Sainsbury's</em> have refused to sell the video of the show. Surely, we should pray and work to encourage the City Council to follow the lead of <em>Tesco's</em> and <em>Sainsbury's</em> and seek the cancellation of the production. What is particularly shocking is that the <em>Theatre Royal</em> is encouraging school children to attend <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em>. It is offering a concession for "children under 18 in full-time education". This is in spite of the fact that the DVD has an "18" rating.</p><p>Christian people around the country have been protesting against this country-wide tour. As a result in Plymouth the theatre was reported 70 percent empty. In York a performance had to be cancelled. In Leicester the local radio station refused to do hospitality evenings for the show and the ticket sales were disappointing. Not surprisingly, on 18 March <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> reported Jon Thoday of Avalon Productions as saying that "the show [which attracted a record of more than 30,000 complaints when it was broadcast by BBC2] is playing to half-empty houses and is expected to make a loss of £300,000." </p><p>So, please pray and take appropriate action, e.g. write appropriate letters, for the show to be cancelled in Newcastle (I know some people before writing would need to see the <a href="http://libretto.musicals.ru/text.php?textid=578&amp;language=1">full text</a> of the opera).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Da Vinci code, History, Films and Neo-Gnosticism">(May 2006) The Da Vinci code, History, Films and Neo-Gnosticism</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2006</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                <p>On the 17 May <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, a £56 million film, will open this year's Cannes film festival. That is two days before it is released world-wide. The film is, of course, based on Dan Brown's thriller that has sold more than 30 million copies and in about 40 languages. The film is controversial because of the claim in the book that "almost everything our fathers taught us about Christ is <em>false</em>" (my 2004 Gorgi edition, p 318).</p><p><br><strong><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></strong></p><p>To make the plot of the thriller work Jesus is made out to be married to Mary Magdalene who he intended should lead the church after his death, but "Peter had a problem with that" (p 334). We are then told that a child, born from this union, led to European royalty from whom came the "Holy Grail"! To support this thesis, Brown has his main characters deny the authority and historical value of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Instead appeal is made to later heretical Gnostic texts that the church fathers rejected in the early centuries as spurious fictions. Their plausibility is suggested because in 1945 some Gnostic texts were discovered in the sands of Egypt at Nag Hammadi. However, all that this discovery proved was how right were the early fathers (such as Irenaeus and Tertullian) to reject such documents in the first place.</p><p>In addition Brown rewrites the history of the 325AD Council of Nicea (in modern Turkey). This council confirmed the apostolic and biblical teaching on the divinity of Christ. But the book makes it out that at Nicea you had the leaders of the Church simply wanting to consolidate their power base. So to achieve their goal, it is argued, they imposed on the church (as something new) a divine Christ and an infallible Bible. </p><p>Historically speaking all this is quite "rubbish" (to quote the current Master of the Temple church in London, one of the churches that features in the novel and the film). It is also dishonest. At one point Teabing (one of the characters) argues for the Gnostic gospels and produces a book of photocopies. He then refers to "these … photocopies of the Nag Hammadi and Dead Sea Scrolls [as] the earliest Christian records" (p 331). But that is simply not true. On the one hand the Dead Sea Scrolls were not Christian records at all but Jewish, and on the other hand the Nag Hammadi documents themselves are two to three hundred years later than the time of Christ. They were certainly not "the earliest Christian records." My edition of <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> has an author's note before the novel begins. It is headed "Fact" and then says: "all descriptions of artwork, architecture, <em>documents</em> and secret rituals in this novel are accurate." As I have shown, this is simply not true.</p><p><br><strong>Help for confusions</strong></p><p>Because of the flaws in the book's "theology", because of the world-wide success of the novel, and because there is the fear that the film will confuse many more people, a number of articles, booklets and books have been written to help people sort out fact from fiction in <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>. At Jesmond Parish Church we are recommending that people look at (from the shortest to the longest) either i) my <em>Coloured Supplement</em> for October 2004 <em>Fantasy Faith</em> (4 pp folded-over - this can be downloaded free at www.church.org.uk; or ii) Nicky Gumbel's <em>The Da Vinci Code - a response</em> (25 pp tract); or iii) Brian Edwards, <em>Da Vinci - a broken code</em> (31 pp booklet); or iv) Michael Green's, <em>The Books the Church Suppressed - fiction and truth in the Da Vinci Code</em> (190 pp book). These can all be obtained from the church bookstall.</p><p>Nicky Gumbel reports the following comments on the book. One person "not sympathetic to Christianity" said, "It shows the Bible can't possibly be accurate and that the text was changed;" a Christian said, "It nearly made me lose my faith;" another said, "It made me think I don't have any real facts to back up my faith." Someone else has said: "honestly [reading the book] shook my whole faith. I realize that the book is fiction, but much of what he [Dan Brown] wrote about seemed like it was based on historical facts aside from the characters. Since I am not a Christian scholar, I don't even know where to begin to refute these claims." </p><p>The reflection of Carl Olson and Sandra Miesel, authors of <em>The Da Vinci Hoax</em>, on these confusions is worth noting:</p>
<blockquote><div>It's not surprising that a work of fiction has produced confusion among some Christians about Church history and doctrine at a time when ... basic knowledge of the faith [is] so poor. It is even less surprising that non-Christian readers would be taken in by Brown's revisionist history of the Church. After all, it's a demonstrated fact that most ... are illiterate about major events in the history of their own country ... so why should we expect them to be able to discern fact from fiction when it comes to early Church history and the complex debates over the divinity and person of Jesus Christ that took place in the first four centuries of the Church.</div></blockquote>
<p>A root problem is that today there are those who accept the rewriting of history. This relates to the crisis in the population at large over historical knowledge. There is a post-modern argument that history is no longer a record of objective facts, but "a series of metaphors which cannot be detached from the institutionally produced languages which we bring to bear on it." As a result, it is argued, the distinction between "truth" and "fiction" is blurred.</p><p><br><strong>The Retreat from History</strong></p><p>According to one writer, what you then have is "history [as] a network of agonistic language games where the criterion for success is performance not truth." This means that history can be rewritten according to the needs of any particular group. Gene Veith is surely right: "if history is nothing more than 'a network of agonistic [i.e. fighting, contending] language games,' then any alternative 'language game' that advances a particular agenda, that meets 'success' in countering institutional power, can pass as legitimate history. 'Performance, not truth' is the only criterion. Scholarship becomes rhetorical manipulation. Truth does not have to get in the way." That is so serious. It is a rejection of historical objectivity. In its place there is advocacy scholarship. So you get history rewritten in accordance with, for example, Marxist, radical feminist, homosexual or (in Dan Brown's case) neo-Gnostic agendas.</p><p>This may all sound rather academic. But it is what is being taught in some of our colleges and universities. In her <em>History in Practice</em> (2000), Ludmilla Jordanova writes that the "pursuit of history is, whether practitioners choose to acknowledge it or not, a political occupation." Trevor Pinch of Cornell University says, "what makes a belief true is not its correspondence with an element of reality, but its adoption and authentication by the relevant community."</p><p>Of course interpretation is involved in history writing, but it must be interpretation of facts or what happened. There is now, however, in some quarters a suspicion of <em>all</em> facts as simply the reports of prejudiced writers. So what used to be called "primary sources" for writing history are being downgraded and dismissed as mere "texts". Yes, much of what we know of the past involves "texts" such as published books, diaries, Acts of Parliament, treaties, inscriptions, etc. But the postmodernist Paul de Man then argues: "the bases for historical knowledge are not empirical facts but written texts, even if these masquerade in the guise of wars or revolutions." So the "rhetoric" in these accounts "allows for two incompatible, mutually self-destructive points of view, and therefore puts an insurmountable obstacle in the way of any reading or understanding." The result, says the historian Professor Marwick, is that arguing for "primary sources [like actually reading in detail the Gnostic gospels and comparing them in detail with the biblical Gospels] is a cause for merriment among history's critics, most of whom ... prefer inventing their history to doing the intensely hard work among both secondary and primary sources which is essential for the production of a new contribution to historical knowledge." That may be exaggerated. But certainly other historians are now talking of the "fetishism of documents" and "the cult of the archive".</p><p><br><strong>Social Consequences</strong></p><p>Sooner or later, of course, such academic thinking seeps down through departments of education to teachers and then to pupils in our schools and so to the population at large. No doubt it is only half understood. And no doubt few believe all of what they think they hear. But because tax payers fund these historians and because revisionist historians are invited onto mainstream TV and Radio discussion programmes, they are given national legitimacy. The result is a chilling effect on what people feel free to say who are not "experts". It subtly affects their own beliefs about the past and thus generates a culture of doubt. Of course, it is "rubbish". Of course we can know the truth about the past. True, we cannot know about the past <em>in the same way</em> as we know about the present. But we can know sufficiently. You can know what I wrote in last month's <em>Coloured Supplemen</em>t without any doubt and so can someone else - by looking at a "primary source", the church website. There are, indeed, all sorts of agreed criteria for being confident about the past. But unfortunately, to quote Veith: "Our new teachers, journalists, lawyers, judges and political leaders [and we could add, film and TV producers] have been indoctrinated. Many of them are coming out convinced that there is no objective meaning and that truth is nothing more than an act of power. Those who do not believe in truth are more likely, I believe, to lie. Those who believe that moral values are nothing more than the imposition of power may be more likely to use power to suppress their opposition, whether in enforcing politically correct postures in academia or, when they have political power, in acts of tyranny." (Veith could have added that Paul de Man (1919-1983), whom I have already quoted, was a Belgian Nazi sympathizer and anti-semitic; also Nazi sympathizers, like the British writer David Irving, are famous for their historical revisionism, especially the denials of the Holocaust.)</p><p><br><strong>The Power of Films</strong></p><p>Because of the power of the film, such post modernist beliefs and attitudes are particularly dangerous. This is because films - in the cinema and on TV - are now a major means of "educating" vast numbers of people around the world; and that education may be responsible or irresponsible. As any programme schedule will reveal, documentaries or docudramas are on a varied number of topics. There is a high proportion, however, that are on issues that are controversial and can be sensationalized. To achieve audience ratings (and so income) the temptation to irresponsible revisionism is exceedingly great. Irresponsible revisionism is, of course, where there is virtually no basis whatsoever for the "revision". Sadly it seems that Sony Pictures have fallen for this temptation. They have produced a film that (unless it bears no relation to the book) is based on the false view that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene, had children and was not divine. It will, for a range of reasons, get the attention of millions and earn millions.</p><p>To see this merging of fact with fiction in a less emotive way than in <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> we can take Oliver Stone's film on the assassination of President Kennedy, <em>JFK</em>. The content of that film was described by <em>Time</em> magazine (23 Dec 1991) as follows: "So you want to know, who killed the President and connived in the cover-up? Everybody! High officials in the CIA, the FBI, the Dallas constabulary, all three armed services, Big Business and the White House. Everybody done it - everybody but Lee Harvey Oswald." And this was in spite of both the Warren Commission of 1964 and the House Select Committee on Assassinations of 1976 to 1979 concluding that Oswald <em>was</em> the killer. The hero of the film was the New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison (portrayed by Kevin Costner); and Garrison believed that the Kennedy assassination had been the work of CIA personnel, anti-Castro Cuban exiles, homosexuals, and ultra right-wing activists. "My staff and I solved the case weeks ago," Garrison announced in February 1967. "I wouldn't say this if we didn't have evidence beyond a shadow of a doubt." However, when Garrison brought Clay Shaw a businessman to trial, no such evidence materialized. Today it seems that most people, even those who still believe in some conspiracy, have denounced Garrison as a complete fraud along with the film. But no matter who is right - the point at issue is the power of the film. For apparently in the United States many of those who weren't alive in 1963 when Kennedy was shot - a significant percentage of the population - now have Oliver Stone's film, <em>JKF</em>, as their main source of information about the assassination! Hence the seriousness of <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> film if it becomes a main source of information about early Christian origins.</p><p><br><strong>Bias</strong></p><p>One problem with the media used to be that the truth, if it contradicted what a producer personally believed, was simply never broadcast or filmed. This was called the <em>Pinsky Principle</em>, after an American journalist, Walter Pinsky, who once described his approach to his work like this: "If my research and journalistic instincts tell me one thing, my political instincts another ... I won't fudge it, I won't bend it, but I won't write it." Another problem was and is bias. Film makers and producers of TV documentaries have their minds made up before they start filming over their editorial position, certainly when filming a documentary. One veteran producer of documentaries, Martin Carr, confessed that the producer's first step was to "arrive at a point of view". Balance has to be maintained but maintained carefully - otherwise you upset the "emotional impact" of the programme. He explained how you might first interview someone as an opponent to your position. But if their personality would charm the viewers, you have to go for someone else who would alienate. Referring to a specific programme, Carr reports, "One could only feel a particular way at the end of the film ... the way I felt about it!" </p><p>These realities have been with us for a long time. It is only relatively recently, however, that we have film makers (and also writers of historical fiction) who not only have bias but serve up what is quite false. This is no longer taking artistic licence to "tell a story" based on fact. This is making facts irrelevant and making history itself fiction. In some things this is less important. But when dealing with God truth's this has eternal consequences; yet it is happening with impunity and a level of passivity on the part of Christian believers. As Archbishop Amato has recently said with regard to <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> film, if "such lies and errors had been directed at the Koran or the Holocaust they would have justly provoked a world uprising. Instead if they are directed against the Church and Christians, they remain unpunished."</p><p><br><strong>A New Gnosticism</strong></p><p>The plausibility of <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> is not only because a fog of post modernism means less instinctive questioning about facts and truth. Nor is it, in addition, just because of the power of films and TV to alter consciousness. Probably the greatest plausibility comes from the fact that the Gnosticism the book and the film buys into is very congenial to today's world. For two hundred years the main attack on Christianity in the West came from the rationalism of the so called Enlightenment. People claimed, in spite of the evidence to the contrary, that the Christian faith was supplying myths as life crutches for gullible people. The choice was, therefore, between a sterile secular rationalism or Christianity. But in the second half of the 20th century "spirituality" was rediscovered - a non doctrinal "spirituality", And this new spirituality, which can be seen as Gnosticism in modern dress, is even fashionable in business circles and some areas of medicine. But it was anti- Christian. James Hitchcock highlights the issue:</p>
<blockquote><div>The historical forms of Christianity stand in the way of this new spirituality. Creeds require individuals to rise above themselves, to submit to a truth much greater than themselves, to become real disciples. By contrast, contemporary New Age religion [neo-Gnosticism] is simply the worship of the self, or at best the worship of deities which the self has created ... The moral implications of this are also obvious. The 'sexual revolution' is the single most formidable dividing line ... But if religion is a human invention, there cannot be an objective moral law, and all things are permitted ... [And] Christianity makes fundamental historical claims about itself - that, if Jesus did not live, die and rise again as the Gospels announce, our faith is in vain. This is a daring claim that makes Christianity vulnerable to attack precisely through its history ... Brown [in <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>] invites the reader to see Christianity as nothing less than a gigantic fraud perpetrated over 2000 years, a conspiracy of power which long held a monopoly on the things of the soul and is now being exposed. Shallow though the book is, it is a major weapon in the campaign to discredit the Christian faith once and for all.</div></blockquote>
<p>Paul writes about people who "gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear" (2 Tim 4.3). This is certainly happening today.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>We must be clear about the evils of Gnosticism - this religion, that in its modern form of a new spirituality is so congenial to many in the 21st century. The Gnostics believed many and different things. But generally it was elitist. It was not for everyone. Salvation was only open to those who could transcend matter and this material world which was considered evil. They saw Jesus as only one among the deities and he was not fully human. A number believed that he did not really die on the cross. He only seemed to suffer. The great loss that results from the Gnosticism as you have it in the Gnostic gospels; as reported by Irenaeus and Tertullian; and that is now resurfacing, is the following according to Bishop FitzSimons Alison:</p>
<blockquote><div>It leads us to believe that we need no redemption for our sinful wills, only freedom from our material bodies. What is lost in the Gnostic gospels is: the trust in and knowledge of God, whom we call 'Father'; that the material world and our bodies are good; that we sinners have been shown mercy, not just given secret knowledge; that the suffering of Christ gives hope and fellowship in our suffering; and that as Christ was raised from the dead, so our deaths are not the last word.</div></blockquote>
<p>There is undoubtedly a spiritual battle going on. We read about spiritual warfare in Ephesians 6. There we are told: "Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but ... against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." We are also told about the spiritual armour we need: truth, righteousness, the gospel, faith, salvation and the word of God. Finally we are to pray. We are "to be alert and <em>always keep on praying</em> for all the saints" (Eph 6.10,13-18). May we use that armour and keep on praying.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Nicea, Athanasius and His Creed">(June 2006) Nicea, Athanasius and His Creed</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2006</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Trinity Sunday is 11 June 2006. The old Book of Common Prayer encourages the use of the Athanasian Creed, a creed based on the Bible, on Whitsunday and Trinity Sunday. But few churches ever now say this Creed in public, as at first it seems a little difficult. However, to make up for that at JPC, I like to write about it from time to time and provide a copy of the text for reading.<br><br><br><b>Nicea and the Trinity</b><br><br>We need to start with the Council of Nicea in AD 325. This was a pivotal moment in the history of the Church. At stake was the divinity of Christ. The issue was this: was the Church going to follow the historic facts regarding Jesus in, what someone has called, all their “dizzying and unfathomable truth”? Or was the Church going to refuse to face those facts? Were the Nicene Fathers going to say something that was more comfortable and more understandable - namely that Jesus was not truly divine and but was himself a creature and there was a time “when he was not”? Or were they going to follow the Apostles and the trinitarian faith of the Bible and confess him as, yes, fully a man, but also as their Lord and God? <br><br>The Bible makes the “tri” “unity” in God clear. He is both three and one. Jesus had told his disciples to baptize "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28.19) - note "name", not <i>plural</i> “names”. The Trinity is, of course, a mystery beyond our understanding. But this is no different from other divine realities such as God's eternity, his infinity, his being all knowing and his providential control of our free actions. As the prophet Isaiah put it, “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts” (55.9). The facts given us by the New Testament Apostles, who were eyewitnesses from the time of Jesus himself, point inescapably to God's essential three-in-oneness. The Apostles show that the Jesus who was prayed to, prayed to God as his Father. He also promised that he and his Father would send “another Counsellor” to continue his divine ministry after he left this world. The Trinity is also seen in our salvation - the Father planning it, the Son dying for us and the Spirit making it real in our lives (see 2 Corinthians 13.14; Ephesians 1.3-14; 2 Thessalonians 2.13ff; 1 Peter 1.2). God's grace in Christ's incarnation, especially in his death and resurrection, emphatically revealed the one God to be plural. And that plurality was explicitly taught by Jesus himself, as being one with God while fully human (see Luke 24.39; John 10.30).<br><br><br><b>The Nicene and Athanasian Creeds</b><br><br>At Nicea the Church Fathers voted not to follow Arius, a revisionist (or heretical) clergyman. Arius led those wanting to interpret Jesus in the light of contemporary wisdom and deny his full divinity and say he was created. Thankfully, the majority of the Nicene Fathers followed his opponent, Athanasius. The fundamental issue can be seen in a phrase in the Nicene Creed that we say at Holy Communion. We say Jesus is “of one being with the Father”, or, as the old Book of Common Prayer translates it, “of one substance with the Father”. The original Greek word was <i>homoousion</i>, “of the same or identical being”. Others had wanted <i>homoiousion</i>. The additional “i” or iota, meant, “of like being”. That failed to say Jesus was divine, but only godly or “godlike”. So it was rejected. Thomas Carlyle was, surely, right to comment that one iota marked the difference between paganism and Christianity.<br><br>What followed the Council of Nicea was similar to what has followed the last Anglican Lambeth Conference of 1998 (in 1998 there was a clear decision that homosexual sex was not right because the Bible forbids it). The revisionist (or heretical) elements in the Church in the 4th century then were (and in the 21st century now are) defying the agreed decisions. Athanasius found things very hard. It has been said that the history of the years after Nicea is little more than a history of the persecutions of Athanasius. Richard Hooker, the Anglican Reformer, wrote: “this was the plain condition of these times: the whole world against Athanasius, and Athanasius against it.” As today, many of the Bishops caved in. But God was in control. By the time of the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 the truth had prevailed. The final consensus is reflected in the Creed named after Athanasius, our Athanasian Creed. This is the most theological of the three basic creeds (the Apostles' Creed being the earliest and simplest). Its doctrines are statements that follow the facts and the mystery rather than try to explain them. They form a boundary or fence around the truth. They are important for what is being ruled out, for example, <i>tritheism</i>, that there are three gods or <i>Unitarianism</i>, that there is one God who is not three and Christ not divine, or <i>modalism</i>, that the one God is simply playing three roles.<br><br><br><b>The Text</b><br><br>What then does the Athanasian creed say? Here is a modern translation by C.H. Turner and it is based on the revised Latin text: <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>“Whoever desires to be saved must above all things hold the Catholic (or Universal) faith. Unless a man keeps it in its entirety inviolate, he will assuredly perish eternally (see the 'Conclusion' below).Now this is the Catholic faith, that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in unity, without confusing the persons or dividing the substance. For the Father's person is one, the Son's another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is one, their glory is equal, their majesty coeternal.Such as the Father is, such is the Son, such also the Holy Spirit. The Father is increate, the Son increate, the Holy Spirit increate. The Father is infinite, the Son infinite, the Holy Spirit infinite. The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal. Yet there are not there eternals, but one eternal; just as there are not three increates or three infinites, but one increate and one infinite. In the same way the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, the Holy Spirit almighty; yet there are not three almighties, but one almighty.Thus the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit God; and yet there are not three Gods, but there is one God. Thus the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet there are not three Lords, but there is one Lord. Because just as we are obliged by Christian truth to acknowledge each person separately both God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the Catholic religion to speak of three Gods or Lords.The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created but begotten. The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this trinity there is nothing before or after, nothing greater or less, but all three persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. Thus in all things, as has been stated above both Trinity in unity and unity in Trinity must be worshipped. So he who desires to be saved should think thus of the Trinity.It is necessary, however, to eternal salvation that he should also faithfully believe in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is equally both God and man.He is God from the Father's substance, begotten before time; and he is man from his mother's substance, born in time. Perfect God, perfect man composed of a rational soul and human flesh, equal to the Father in respect of his divinity, less than the Father in respect of his humanity.Who although he is God and man, is nevertheless not two but one Christ. He is one, however, not by the transformation of his divinity into flesh, but by the taking up of his humanity into God; one certainly not by confusion of substance, but by oneness of person. For just as rational soul and flesh are a single man, so God and man are a single Christ.Who suffered for our salvation, descended to hell, rose from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the Father's right hand, whence he will come to judge living and dead: at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies, and will render an account of their deeds; and those who have behaved well will go to eternal life, those who have behaved badly to eternal fire.This is the Catholic faith. Unless a man believes it faithfully and steadfastly, he will not be able to be saved.”</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>With regard to the first paragraph (and in the old BCP translation of the Latin it reads, “Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly”), C.S.Lewis helpfully said the following: “The operative word is <i>keep</i>; not <i>acquire</i>, or even <i>believe</i> but <i>keep</i>. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters ... who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion, ... to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought.”<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Right and Wrong">(August 2006) Right and Wrong</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2006</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>morals</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>A number of young people today are incapable of calling anything evil. I read last month of a university teacher, a woman, talking to students about a village where a horrific ritual involving human sacrifice had taken place. She was shocked, however, at their reaction. She found, it was said, that "she was teaching a room full of moral relativists who thought that the ritual might be all right 'if it's a part of a person's culture ... and if it has worked for them'. No one in the whole group of twenty ostensibly intelligent individuals would go out on a limb and take a stand against human sacrifice." But this moral relativism is now in the church. An Episcopalian clergyman had supported the recent consecration, as a bishop in America, of Gene Robinson - a man who has left his wife and daughters to live with his homosexual lover. When the clergyman was asked how he could go along with such behaviour, he apparently said that the movement of the spirit in the community takes precedence over scriptural revelation.<br><br>Moral relativism is also in the highest reaches of politics. At a conference last year the UN General Secretary, Kofi Annan, was reported as saying: "Unquestionably, very evil things happen in the world ... [But] if we are intent on naming evil, then let us call it intolerance." That says it all. Of course, in civil society there are a range of things you have to tolerate. But evil is not to be one of them. <br><br><br><b>Morality and Islam</b><br><br>With regard to sexual morality even the Roman writer Cicero, writing before Christ, seems not to have relativized such behaviour: "nature and reason command that nothing uncomely, nothing effeminate [homosexual immorality], nothing lascivious [heterosexual immorality] be done or thought." But today we live in disordered times. On the 26 July 2006 the BBC Newsnight programme had a discussion on George Michael who was caught "cruising" (trying to pick up a man for homosexual sex) on Hampstead Heath in London. So a discussion was staged. But it was not balanced between someone who thought homosexual sex was wrong, on the one hand, and a member of the gay community, on the other. No! It was just between Peter Tatchell, the gay activist, and another man who ran a gay web-site. The discussion presupposed the acceptability of homosexual sex. The point at issue was simply, to quote the BBC, "is casual sex a natural part of gay culture?" The prophet Isaiah wrote about such disorder when he said: "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter" (Is 5.20).<br><br>There needs to be change - certainly if we want to live with a level of security in the West. The BBC <i>Panorama</i> programme on the last Sunday of July, "Faith, Hate and Charity", made it clear that radical Muslims are wanting, and expecting, to take over the West. Undoubtedly in Britain these are a minority of Muslims. The majority are peace loving. But, according to a Populus poll, 13 per cent of Britain's 1.6 million Muslims (208,000) believe that the London Bombers of 7 July 2005 should be regarded as martyrs, with seven per cent (112,000) thinking that suicide attempts on British targets can be justified, while 2 per cent (32,000) would be proud if a family member joined Al Qaeda, with a further 16 per cent (256,000) being indifferent. That is a lot of Muslims. Nor is this fanaticism all due to poverty, as is too easily said. It is often because some are <i>committed</i> Muslims who are not economically alienated but morally alienated. Melanie Phillips writes of modern society "bombarding [young Muslim men] with drugs, alcohol, pornography and sexually available young women, and a governing class which constantly rubbishes Britain's bedrock values."<br><br>Such immorality leads to distorted perceptions of Christianity for many Muslims. Robby Butler tells of a Kuwaiti Muslim who was asked what he knew about Christians and Christianity. The man replied that a Christian is someone who promotes immorality, pornography and television programmes like <i>Dallas</i> or <i>Sex in the City</i>. Butler then comments, "for a Muslim to say that he has become a Christian is to communicate that he has launched into a secret life of immorality".<br><br>Clearly more needs to be done other than helping Muslims economically. There at least needs to be a recovery of intolerance - an intolerance of wickedness and evil, both in terms of Western sexual licence as well as of Muslim violence. Otherwise many young Muslims will continue to be seduced by Islamic radicals who want to wage a world-wide holy war against "western" societies they see as morally corrupt (as well as opposing Mohammed).<br><br><br><b>QCA and the Moral Law</b><br><br>It is in this context that at the end of July we learnt that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (the QCA) wants to relativize the National Curriculum in our schools. It appears that the QCA is wanting to change the aims of education in key stage 3 - (the first three years at secondary school, 11-14s). And in keeping with this general retreat from objective morality, the QCA no longer wants to help children in "distinguishing between right and wrong". It simply wants them to have "secure values and beliefs" which, of course, may be right or wrong.<br><br>The good news, however, was that <i>The Times</i> newspaper expressed outrage - something unusual for these days. Under the headline "Right and Wrong - to teach the distinction is right: to drop it is wrong", there was the following editorial on 31 July 2006:</p>

<blockquote><div>The proposal that schools should no longer be required to teach teenagers to understand the difference between 'right and wrong' is as astonishing as it is absurd ... Rarely have officials drawn up proposals so inept, so out of step with current thinking and so likely to stir up public anger ... If there is to be any coherent framework in which young people develop as future citizens, that means abandoning the cultural and moral relativism that has reigned so long in the educational establishment and insisting on a more straightforward teaching of what is right and what is wrong, what is acceptable and what is not.</div></blockquote>

<p>There was further good news on the first day of August, when Sir Mark Potter, the President of the Family Division of the High Court, refused to legalize in Britain the Canadian "wedding" of two lesbians. In doing so he reinforced the traditional view of marriage. He spoke of "marriage as an age-old institution, valued and valuable, respectable and respected, as a means not only of encouraging monogamy but also the procreation of children and their development and nurture in a family unit, in which both maternal and paternal influences are available ... This form of relationship [marriage] is the one which best encourages stability in a well-regulated society".<br><br>But can we be so sure that there is such a thing as "right and wrong"? The answer is, Yes! All civilizations that survive have some idea of right and wrong or a moral law. Paul wrote to the Romans about the Gentiles "who do not have the law [written]", but he said that when they...</p>

<blockquote><div> ... do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them" (Rom 2.14-15).</div></blockquote>

<p>For the Christian believer that moral law is found throughout the Bible but summarized in the Ten Commandments and importantly expounded in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. Where the interpretation is unclear, the (16th century) <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i> of the Church of England are still helpful. Article XX says the Church may not "so expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to another." On the interpretation of the law in particular Article VII is helpful:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The threefold division into ceremonial, civil and moral laws is reasonable. Christ has clearly fulfilled the ceremonial laws through his sacrifice for us on the Cross; a number of local laws or "civil precepts" were obviously for the political system of the time - although the principles behind individual laws can still be relevant; and the moral law is sufficiently self-evident. As the Dean of Sydney, Phillip Jensen says: "the bible does not always distinguish these usages for us. [But] the differences in the law should be obvious to anybody who has sight. They are evident by their very content to anybody who wishes to be obedient to God." There is right and there is wrong.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Prayer - A Paraphrase of J.C.Ryle">(September 2006) Prayer - A Paraphrase of J.C.Ryle</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2006</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>[The 19th century bishop, J.C.Ryle, wrote a 12000 word paper on Prayer. Here it is reduced to 3000 words and rewritten for easier reading. DRJH]</i><br><br>Jesus taught that "his disciples ... should always pray and not give up" (Lk 18.1). Prayer is <i>the</i> most important part of the Christian life. Reading the Bible, Sunday worship, hearing sermons and Holy Communion are all vital. But none are as important as prayer. Here are seven reasons why.<br><br><br><b>Prayer is essential for salvation</b><br><br>Leaving aside the issues of the very young and those who have never heard the gospel, no one can expect to be saved who does not pray. Yes, salvation is by grace. But there is no salvation without <i>asking</i> for it. The Bible teaches that no one will be saved by their prayers, but it does not teach that anyone will be saved without prayer. No one can eat, drink or sleep by proxy. As it is with the body, so it is with the soul. Its health and well being depend on each one going to Christ in prayer for themselves. To be prayerless is to be without God, without Christ, without grace, without hope and without heaven. It is to be on the road to hell.<br><br>A habit of prayer is one of the surest marks of a true Christian. From the moment there is any spiritual life and reality, a person prays. The first sign of life in an infant is breathing; so the first act of a born again believer is to pray. God's chosen ones, says Jesus, "cry out to him day and night" (Lk 18:7) and the Holy Spirit makes them cry, "Abba, Father" (Rom 8.15). The godly in the Bible pray. The wicked do not (1 Pet 1.17; 1 Cor 1.2; Ps 14.4). In church history great Christians – whether rich or poor, educated or not – have all been people of prayer. True, there can be hypocritical praying. But the absence of prayer is a clear sign that a man or woman is not yet a Christian. The Lord himself suggests prayer is the best proof of true conversion. When he sent Ananias to Saul in Damascus, the evidence he gave of Paul's change of heart was this: "he is praying" (Acts 9.11). The first act of faith is to speak to God.<br><br>Faith is to the soul what life is to the body. Prayer is to faith what breath is to life. How someone can live and not breathe is beyond understanding. Similarly, how someone can believe and not pray is also beyond understanding. Their views of doctrine may be correct. But this may only be head knowledge. The vital question is this: do they speak <i>to</i> God as well as speak <i>about</i> God?<br><br><br><b>No duty is so neglected as private prayer</b><br><br>Even some calling themselves Christian may never pray. They eat, drink, sleep, work and play. But they <i>never speak to God</i>. So they live like animals - without a word to say to the one in whose hands are their life and breath and from whose mouth one day they will receive their eternal judgment. <br><br>It is <i>not natural</i> to pray. The natural desire of a person's heart is to get away from God and to have nothing to do with him. Why then should someone pray who has no sense of sin or an awareness of spiritual needs?<br><br>Nor is it <i>fashionable</i> to pray. It is something many would be ashamed to own. So the lives many live are without prayer; and <i>the deaths many die</i> are without prayer. They die the deaths of those who seem strangers to God.<br><br><br><b>Encouragements to pray</b><br><br>God has done everything to make prayer easy. There is a way by which anyone, however sinful, can draw near to God the Father. Jesus Christ has opened that way by the sacrifice he made for us on the Cross. So the holiness and justice of God should never frighten sinners and keep them back. They need only cry to God in the name of Jesus, pleading his atoning death, and they will find him gracious and willing to hear. The name of Jesus is a never-failing passport when praying. Jesus Christ is an <i>advocate</i> and intercessor. He waits to present the prayers of those who will use him. <i>The Holy Spirit</i>, also, has a special role of assisting Christians speak to God (Rom 8.26).<br><br>There are great <i>promises</i> for those who pray. Jesus said: "Ask and it will be given to you... For everyone who asks receives" (Mat 7.7,8); "if you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer" (Mat 21.22); "I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father" (Jn 14.13). And he told the Parables of the Friend at Midnight and the Persistent Widow (Lk 11.5 and 18.1). These are great encouragements to pray.<br><br>There are also wonderful <i>examples</i> of the power of prayer. Nothing seems too great, too hard or too difficult for prayer. In the Bible we read that prayer opened the Red Sea in Moses' day and brought down fire on the sacrifice at Carmel in Elijah's day. In Church history we read of Mary Queen of Scots saying: "I fear John Knox's prayers more than an army of ten thousand men." <br><br><br><b>Faithfulness in prayer - a key to holiness</b><br><br>There is a vast difference among true Christians. They are all doing the Lord's work – but some do more than others! They all love the same Lord and Saviour – but some love him more than others! There are some of the Lord's people who seem <i>never able to get on </i>from the time of their conversion. They are born again but remain spiritual babies. Others seem to be <i>always getting on</i>. Every year they appear to see more, know more and grow in grace. They not only have good works to prove the reality of their faith, but they are <i>zealous</i> for good works. They not only do good, but they <i>do not get weary</i> in doing good (Gal 6.9). They attempt great things and they do great things. Why? They pray.<br><br>Prayer receives fresh and continued outpourings of the Spirit. The Spirit alone begins the work of grace in a person's heart. But a believer is to pray for the Holy Spirit who gives strength for holiness (Lk 11.12). So prayer is a remedy against the devil and besetting sins.<br><br><br><b>Neglect of prayer - a cause of backsliding</b><br><br>A person can go back in the Christian faith after making a good start. People may do well for a period, like the Galatians, but then go after false teachers (Gal 1.6). There are those who sound good when their enthusiasm is high, like Peter, but then, in a time of trial, they deny their Lord. Others lose their first love, as the Ephesians did (Rev 2.4). It is miserable being a backslider. True grace will never by extinguished, and true union with Christ never broken. But a person, it seems, can fall away so far that they lose sight of their own security and despair of their own salvation.<br><br>What is the cause of such backsliding? One of the causes is, surely, neglect of private prayer. Bibles read without prayer, sermons heard without prayer, marriages contracted without prayer, travel undertaken without prayer, homes chosen without prayer, friendships formed without prayer, or the daily act of prayer itself being hurried over and gone through without meaning – these are some downward steps by which many a Christian descends to a condition of spiritual palsy, or reaches a point where God allows them a tremendous fall. We may be sure people fall in private long before they fall in public. They backslide on their knees long before they backslide openly before the world. Like Peter, they first ignore the Lord's warning to watch and pray; then, like Peter, their strength is gone and, when tempted, deny their Lord. If you do not wish to be a backslider, <i>check your praying</i>.<br><br><br><b>Prayer - a recipe for happiness and contentment</b><br><br>We live in a world where, since sin entered, there is great sorrow. Few live long without sorrows or cares. Their bodies, property, families, children, relations, colleagues, friends, neighbours and work – all are sources of care. Sickness, death, financial loss, disappointments, separations, ingratitude, slander – are common to all.<br><br>What is the best solution? Answer: <i>take everything to the Lord in prayer</i>. This is the plain advice of both the Old and New Testaments: "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you" (Ps 50.15); "cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you" (Ps 55.22); "do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus" (Phil 4.6-7); "is any one of you in trouble? He should pray" (Jas 5.13). <br><br>Happiness does not depend on outward circumstances, but on the state of the heart! Prayer can lighten crosses whatever their weight. It can call down the one who will "never leave you nor forsake you" (Deut 31.8). Prayer is a secret of being a happy Christian.<br><br>So prayer is the most important part of the Christian life. Now, however, there are a number of practical comments that need to be made.<br><br><br><b>First, for those who do not pray</b><br><br>Such people need to be solemnly warned. They are in fearful danger. If they die in their present state, they are eternally lost. It is no good saying they do <i>not know how</i> to pray. Prayer is the simplest act of all. It is simply speaking to God. It needs neither learning nor wisdom to begin. It needs nothing but an honest heart and will. The smallest infant can cry when hungry. So anyone can find something to say to God, if only they have a mind to.<br><br>It is no good saying they have <i>no suitable place</i> to pray in. Jesus prayed on a mountain; Peter on a house-top; Isaac in a field; Nathaniel under a fig tree; and Jonah in the stomach of a large fish. Any place can be a place of prayer. It is no good saying <i>they have no time</i>. Time may be short but time is always long enough for prayer. Daniel was a top civil servant but prayed three times a day. David was the ruler of a powerful nation, yet said: "Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and [God] hears my voice" (Ps 55.17). It is no good saying they <i>cannot pray until they have faith and a new heart</i> and so they must wait until then. This is to add sin to sin. Isaiah said, "call on [the Lord] while he is near" (Is 55.6); and Peter said to Simon Magus, "Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord" (Acts 8.22). If someone wants faith and a new heart, they should cry to the Lord for them.<br><br><br><b>Secondly, for those wanting to be saved and where to start</b><br><br>In every journey there is a first step. A journey may take a long time. The Israelites were forty years in the wilderness; but someone first went out of Egypt at the Exodus. When does someone take the first step in turning from sin and the world to God? Answer – when they first utter a heartfelt prayer.<br><br>Such a person who desires salvation should go to Jesus Christ and ask him, in prayer, to save them. They should tell him they have heard he receives sinners and has said: "whoever comes to me I will never drive away" (John 6.37). They should ask for deliverance from the guilt, power and consequences of their sin; and they should ask him to give them a new heart and to plant the Holy Spirit in their lives. They should tell him this in their own words. If a doctor came to them when they were sick, they could tell him where they felt pain. Similarly if they are really aware of their spiritual sickness, they can find something to tell Christ. Nor must they think that he will not save them because they are sinners. He himself said, "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance" (Lk 5.32).<br><br>And they should not be frightened because their prayers are not fluent. A mother understands the first words of her child. So Christ understands sinners. Nor should they be disheartened if they do not get answers immediately. While they are speaking, Jesus is listening. If he delays, it is only for their good. They should pray on.<br><br><br><b>Thirdly, for those who do pray</b><br><br>Many often despair of their own praying. There are few genuine believers who do not find prayer a conflict. However, people can be poor judges of prayers (and prayer meetings). Prayers which please them <i>least</i> may often please God <i>most</i>. Here then are twelve suggestions for true believers about what is important in prayer.<br><br><b>1) </b>the importance of <i><b>reverence and humility in prayer</b></i>. It is a solemn thing to speak with God. When Abraham spoke to God, he said, "I am nothing but dust and ashes" (Gen 18.27). Similarly when Job spoke to God, he said, "I am unworthy" (Job 40.4).<br><br><b>2) </b>the importance of <i><b>praying spiritually</b></i> – that is to say people should seek the help of the Holy Spirit for their private prayers - to help avoid a wrong sort of formality. Yes, everyone must go over old ground in their prayers. But if the skeleton and outline of their praying has to be a form, they should seek to ensure that the clothing of that skeleton is, as far as possible, of the Spirit.<br><br><b>3) </b>the importance of <i><b>making prayer regular in life</b></i>. Regular times can help. God is a God of order. Disorder is one of the fruits of sin. But no one should be under bondage. Only this must be insisted on - that for a person's spiritual health they make praying part of the business of every twenty-four hours. They allot time for eating, sleeping and work. So they should allot time for prayer. They should choose their own time. At the very least they should speak with God in the morning before they speak to the world and at night after they have finished with the world.<br><br><b>4) </b>the importance of <i><b>perseverance in prayer</b></i>. Once having started the habit of prayer, it should never be given up. Someone may say: "I have important work to do today" - and prayer is ignored. Prayers do not always have to be the same length. But no one should ever give up on prayer. Paul said: "pray continually" (1 Thess 5.17). He did not mean that people should always be on their knees, as a sect, called the Euchitae, thought. He did mean, however, that prayer should be like the Old Testament continual burnt offerings, with fire on the altar, not always consuming sacrifices but never completely going out. Longer prayer times may be tied together by an endless chain of short ejaculatory prayers throughout the day. Even when with others or at work or at school or travelling, people can silently be praying to God as Nehemiah did in the presence of Artaxerxes (Neh 2.4).<br><br><b>5) </b>the importance of <i><b>earnestness in prayer</b></i>. No one needs to shout or scream or be very loud. But it is good for people to be fervent and warm and ask as if they were really interested in what they were doing. Elijah "prayed earnestly" (Jas 5.17). His was not sleepy or lazy praying. The Bible speaks of "crying and knocking" in prayer. Jesus, the Bible says, "offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears" (Heb 5.7).<br><br><b>6) </b>the importance of <i><b>praying with faith</b></i>. Christians should believe their prayers are always heard and will be granted if asked according to God's will. The plain command of Jesus is: "whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours" (Mk 11.24). Faith is to prayer what the feather is to an arrow: without it prayer will not hit the mark. The habit of pleading God's promises should be cultivated. Psalm 119 is full of things asked for "according to your word." Then above all the habit of expecting answers to prayer should be cultivated. Businessmen expect to see a return. So should true believers. Often they do not. The church at Jerusalem prayed for Peter in prison; but when prayer was answered, they hardly believed it (Acts 12.15). Robert Traill, a 17th century Scot, said: "There is no surer mark of trifling in prayer, than when men are careless of what they get by prayer."<br><br><b>7)</b> the importance of <i><b>boldness in prayer</b></i>. There is an improper familiarity in some people's prayers. But there is such a thing as holy boldness. This is the boldness of Moses who pleaded with God not to destroy Israel: "why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them ... '? Turn from your fierce anger" (Ex 32.12). Many do not sufficiently realize the believer's privileges. They do not plead as often as they might: "Lord, are we not your people? Is it not for your glory that the gospel should be effective and the church should grow?"<br><br><b>8)</b> the importance of <i><b>fullness in prayer</b></i>. Jesus warns against the Pharisees for their long hypocritical prayers. But he himself could spend all night in prayer to God. Today people are not likely to err on the side of praying <i>too much</i>. Many pray <i>too little</i>. The aggregate of time many Christians spend in prayer is probably very small. They pray just enough to prove they are spiritually alive and no more. The Bible says: "you do not have, because you do not ask God" (Jas 4.2). So much is offered in Christ. The Lord says: "open wide your mouth and I will fill it" (Ps 81.10).<br><br><b>9) </b>the importance of <i><b>being specific in prayer</b></i>. People should not be content with generalities in prayer, but with particulars. Needs should be specified and specific sins confessed. Jacob told God exactly what he feared in regard to Esau (Gen 32.11). So did Eliezer, when he sought a wife for his master's son (Gen 24.12ff). Nothing is too small to be named before God. What would be thought of patients who told their doctors they were ill, but never went into details? Christ is the true physician of the heart. Secrets should not be hidden from him.<br><br><b>10) </b>the importance of <i><b>intercession in prayer</b></i>. By nature all are selfish. Selfishness can still stick, even when a person is converted to Christ. So they can tend to pray only for their own needs and forget others. But there should be a public spirit. People should be careful to pray for others. The whole world should be prayed for – the secular world, the pagan world (including Muslims), Jews, false teachers, true believers, the government and nation, the Church of and in England, the local church and the family. To pray for others, or "intercede", enlarges sympathies, expands hearts and is for the benefit of all.<br><br><b>11) </b>the importance of <i><b>thankfulness in prayer</b></i>. Yes, asking God is one thing and praising him is another. But there is a close connection between praise and prayer. Thankfulness must be a part of prayer. Paul says: "in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God" (Phil 4.6). It is only by God's mercy that true believers will not be in hell, have a hope of heaven, have been called by the Spirit, are still alive and have opportunities of glorifying God. There is much for which to thank God.<br><br><b>12) </b>in the last place, the importance of <i><b>being watchful over praying</b></i>. Prayer is that point above all others in the Christian life where people must be on their guard. Here true religion begins and flourishes; but here it also decays. A person's prayer life shows their spiritual state. Prayer is the spiritual pulse: by it spiritual health can be tested. Sermons, books, meetings and fellowship are all valuable. But they will never make up for the neglect of private (and corporate) prayer. So Christian believers should find out what places, people and things unhinge their hearts from communion with God and so <i>be on their guard</i>. Equally they should find out what, or who, helps them be in a spiritual frame of mind and most ready to speak to God. These they should <i>cling to and stick to</i>.<br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>It is so important to get prayer right. May the times in which we live be praying times and may Christians be praying Christians.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Is Jesus Christ the Only Way?">(October 2006) Is Jesus Christ the Only Way?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2006</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>During the past month there has been much analysis and questioning over the consequences of what happened five years ago in New York. So what has followed those Muslim extremists flying planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre (and the Pentagon) and killing thousands? John Piper, an American pastor and author, says this writing from a Christian perspective:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>The terrorism of September 11, 2001, released a brief tidal wave of compassion and cowardice in the Christian Church. It brought out the tender love of thousands and the terrible loss of theological nerve. 'Ground Zero' became a place of agonizing comfort as Christians wept with those who wept, while radio talk shows and Muslim-Christian ecumenical gatherings became places of compromise as leaders minimized Christ and clouded the nature of Islam with vague words about 'one God'. The tension between strong Christian love and weak Christological cowardice will not survive indefinitely. If the root is cut, the fruit will die - sooner or later. The reluctance to pray publicly in the majestic name of Jesus Christ; the disinclination to make clear distinctions between Allah and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; the fear of drawing attention to the fact that Islam consciously rejects the entire foundation of Christian salvation, namely, the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus - this loss of conviction and courage will in the end undermine the very love and joy it aims to advance.</div></blockquote>

<p>A number, of course, have not lost their theological nerve. A distinguished American church historian, Timothy George asked the question to which Piper refers, "Is the Father of Jesus the God of Mohammed?" He replied, "Yes and No. Yes, in the sense that the Father of Jesus is the only God there is. He is the Creator and Sovereign Lord of Mohammed, Buddha, Confucius, of every person who has ever lived. He is the one before whom all shall one day bow (Phil 2.5-11). Christians and Muslims can together affirm many important truths about this great God - his oneness, eternity, power, majesty. As the Qur'an puts it, he is 'the Living, the Everlasting, the All-High, the All-Glorious'. But the answer is No, for Muslim theology rejects the divinity of Christ and the personhood of the Holy Spirit - both essential components of the Christian understanding of God. No devout Muslim can call the God of Mohammed 'Father', for this, to their mind, would compromise divine transcendence." Pope Benedict XVI also in September voiced criticisms of Islam and, which was not well reported, of some Christian theologians and modern secularists. This resulted in the shocking killing of one elderly nun and attacks on churches around the world. Fear of Muslim violence and a secular philosophy of 'multi-faithism' means that even in the so called 'free world' many are now cautious about saying anything critical of other religions and philosophies (and of Islam in particular). If truth matters, intellectually this is suicide. In such a context, the following, I hope, will be helpful. It is an edited portion from my The Church and State in the New Millennium, London, HarperCollins, 2000 (the year before '9/11').<br><br><b>Multi-faithism and theological liberalism</b><br><br>In 1879 Cardinal Newman summarized the essence of theological liberalism like this: "Liberalism in religion is the doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion, but that one creed is as good as another ... It is inconsistent with any recognition of any religion as true. It teaches that all are to be tolerated, for all are matters of opinion." This approach when faced with an actual 'other religion' becomes multi-faithism. Multi-faithism is a treating of all religions as ultimately the same, all interesting, all to be experienced and none to be privileged. This multi-faithism is now the religion promoted by much of the media, especially the BBC, and in our schools. As a result of such educational policies our children are now often Christianly illiterate. I once heard a former Home Secretary say that for many children it is as though the Old Testament had never been written. A MORI poll revealed appalling ignorance, especially among the young, over the basic elements of the Christian faith. Reporting on this poll, the Press said: "Many Church leaders and politicians laid the blame firmly at the feet of the country's education system." <br><br>And the culture of relativism is also to blame. Openness to everything is fair, if you believe that in principle everything is good. But few of us believe that. We do not want to be 'open' to Muslims killing southern Sudanese, or Serbs killing Muslims in the Balkans, or a host of wicked actions being perpetrated around the world. Some things we want to say are wrong absolutely, and for good reasons. And also we want to say that some things are true. Many do want to say that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life, and that that particular truth is as relevant for public life as it is for private life. They do not believe, however, they should force their views on anyone. They do believe they should seek to persuade and educate people into the truth. But are there grounds for such beliefs? Is it reasonable to talk about the uniqueness of Jesus Christ? Some will say that belief in his uniqueness is due to ignorance or arrogance. But ignorance is a two-way argument. Many orthodox Christians have considerable experience of other religions, even more than their opponents. With regard to arrogance it must be stressed that truth has nothing to do with questions of pride (or humility). Rather it has all to do with matters of fact. The claim to the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ is a truth claim and, therefore, a question of fact. That is why all claims cannot be right. Peter Cotterell, an English missiologist, puts it like this:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>Islam says Jesus wasn't crucified. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Judaism says Jesus was not the Messiah. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Hinduism says that God has often been incarnate. We say only once. And we can't both be right. Buddhism says that the world's miseries will end when we do what's right. We say, you can't do what's right: the world's miseries will end when we believe what is right. The fact is that the world's religions may agree about the peripheral matters but they disagree precisely about the most important matters of all. Any intelligent person could decide that all religions are wrong. Any intelligent person could decide that one is right and the rest wrong. But no intelligent person can seriously believe that all religions are essentially the same.</div></blockquote>

<p>Nor is this western triumphalism. To say that Christ is unique is not to say that other cultures are therefore automatically inferior and all is well with the West; nor is it to say even that Christian activities are unique. The uniqueness simply lies in whom Christians believe. It is Christ who is unique, it is claimed, not the West nor the followers who worship him.<br><br><b>The Cultural Limitations of Knowledge</b><br><br>Multi-faithism is motored by three pressures. P.F.Knitter in the preface to the book The Myth of Christian Uniqueness refers to these as: one, "the historico-cultural limitations of all knowledge and religious beliefs"; two, "religious experience [being] infinite"; and, three, "the confrontation with the sufferings of humanity and the need to put an end to such outrages."<br><br>These are big issues. Let me just touch on them. Knitter is, first, referring to the sociology of knowledge and the idea that the social environment powerfully conditions beliefs. Most of this is common-sense. It is clear that apart from a few areas of direct personal experience human beings require social support for their beliefs about reality. For example, an individual does not need someone else to prove they have toothache. But they do need social support for a wide range of religious and moral beliefs. Peter Berger puts it like this: "physical pain imposes its own plausibility without any social mediations, while morality [or religion] requires particular social circumstances in order to become and remain plausible to the individual." And these social circumstances form in modern societies a range of 'plausibility structures.' Take the armed forces and public schools, as examples. So long as people are in such institutions certain values will be plausible in an unquestioned way. But once they move out and 'migrate' to other social contexts these values may be questioned.<br><br>We can also say that there is a direct relationship between the cohesion of institutions and common beliefs, values and world-views. When a school is strong and effective, its pupils will most likely have the same value system in regard to discipline, manners and the importance of hard work. Similarly when institutions break up, there will be a break up of plausibility structures and a weakening of every belief and value that depends on social support. So a weak school will have pupils who are likely to be disorderly, disobedient and lazy.<br><br>In part this is the reason why multi-faithism is so pernicious. It is, in itself, an act of institutional deconstruction. If it is right, fine; but if it is wrong, it is much more serious than mere theological sloppiness. It is destroying the social support of belief for many people. We need not develop this further. All we need note is the following fact: the cultural limitation of knowledge and religious beliefs cannot be a reason for accepting a pluralistic theology of religions as Knitter seems to imply. Truth questions will still remain. The sociology of knowledge in no way removes questions of truth. It can show why modern man finds it easier to believe in electricity than demons. But the question of the existence of demons still remains. The sociology of knowledge can show why modern people often feel reluctant to say that Jesus Christ is God's unique and final revelation to mankind in spite of the evidence. But the question of whether he was, or whether he was not, still remains.<br><br><b>Religious Experience and Justice</b><br><br>Knitter, secondly, talks about 'religious experience'. Since Schleiermacher, a liberal Protestant theologian at the turn of the 18th/19th centuries, there has been the belief in a reservoir of 'world spirituality'. All the religions tap into it and we can all draw from it. Add to that the effect of the 'History of Religions School' at the beginning of the 20th century; this 'school' not only mapped out but tried to synthesize the religions of the world, and so reinforced a concern for experience. Add to that various pronouncements of the WCC (the World Council of Churches) in the second half of the 20th century on inter-faith matters. Then add a Roman Catholic post-Vatican II stress that God's grace is given not only through non-Christian religions but even through Atheism. And finally add the Roman Catholic Karl Rahner's talk about 'anonymous Christians'. Do not then be surprised when you have both a growing belief in the value of any religious experience and new plausibility structures. <br><br>With regard to religious experience, traditional Christian theology has always been cautious. As Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evil doers!'" (Matthew 7:22).</div></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore the interest in religious experience is reinforced by the 'concentric circle' way of looking at other religions. This may have spread originally from Roman Catholic teaching such as you have in the Papal Encyclical Suam Ecclesiam. The model is of the Roman Catholic church forming the centre circle; then a little further out are other Christian churches; beyond that is a circle of other theistic religions; beyond that a circle of various animistic and non-theistic religions; then on the far edge are the secularists with no religion at all. But are the other religions to be measured by their nearness to or distance from Christianity? As Lesslie Newbigin said: "The other religions are not to be understood and measured by their proximity to or remoteness from Christianity. They are not beginnings which are completed in the gospel. They face in different directions, ask fundamentally different questions and look for other kinds of fulfilment than that which is given in the gospel. They turn, as Otto said, on different axes." In Jesus' parable (Luke 18:9-14), was the Pharisee or the tax-collector nearer to Jesus? The Pharisee, no doubt could claim a range of religious experiences. He was committed to 'fasting' - a tried and tested adjunct of religious experience. But it was the tax-collector who went down to his house 'justified'.<br><br>Then, thirdly, Knitter has a concern for justice. There is the assumption that to assert the truth of the Christian faith over against other religions and world-views is essentially a denial of justice. Justice demands toleration. But there is so much confusion over 'toleration'. It has been argued that if you are truly tolerant of others, you will not critically evaluate their beliefs. This, however, is to equate tolerance with indifferentism. There is a commonly held but mistaken view that tolerating a religion is primarily a matter of not making a judgment about it. But that is not the case. Tolerance means no t seeking the legal restraint of something about which you have a negative opinion or negative judgment. This is so important. Let me give you a humanist, non-Christian, writer on this very point - Professor Bernard Crick: "Reacting against the religious disputes of the seventeenth century, toleration both as a state policy and an educated attitude began to spread in Britain in the eighteenth century. But let us remember one essential thing about tolerance. It arises because people do differ on fundamental and important things, but wish to limit the practical effect of their differences. Tolerance is not complete acceptance, still less permissiveness; it is modified disapproval." <br><br>So we must now move on to direct theological questions, as a great amount of 'good stout resolute nonsense' (to quote Lord Halifax) is talked over multi-faithism. The claim to the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ is a truth claim and, therefore, a question of fact. That is why all claims cannot be right. When it comes to the Christian faith we are talking about a 'gospel' or 'good news' about what God has done in history. We are not talking about 'good ideas'. So the question is: "Did God do certain things or did he not?" <br><br><b>Theological Questions</b><br><br>Let me now summarize, in concluding, five reasons for rejecting current multi-faith theology and philosophy.<br><br>First, what we read of the world's religions in the Bible is so often negative. When Paul was having an afternoon off in Athens and saw the evidence of other religions in the city, he did not think about the possibilities of inter-faith worship. No! "His spirit was provoked within him" (Acts 17:16) and he ended up trying to convert the Athenians (see also 1 Corinthians 8:10).<br><br>Secondly, of course, God can choose whom he likes to receive his grace. Melchizedek and Jethro in the Old Testament come to mind as two unlikely characters outside the ancient covenant community. But there is no suggestion that their 'religions' could in any way be alternative to the covenant revealed to Abraham and through him to Moses. In the New Testament the Wise Men received divine guidance, but there is no suggestion that they were saved by their own religion. In fact God brought them to worship the child Jesus. Later on in the New Testament we read that the prayers of the Gentile Cornelius were heard by God. So Peter concluded that "in every nation any one who fears [God] and does what is right is acceptable to him" (Acts 10:34). But Cornelius himself said, under divine prompting, that 'salvation' required more than those prayers: it required the preaching and message of Peter (Acts 11:13-14). Clearly preparation for faith occurs outside the community of the people of God. There was also the Ethiopian eunuch (and there are many similar people in the modern world). But the fact is that in whatever way God meets with people in other religious (or secular) settings, the Bible gives us no grounds for saying there is full salvation apart from acknowledging Christ. Religions (or secular philosophies) may play a part in helping to identify needs. But there is no salvation except in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12). This is not 'anonymous Christianity' at all!<br><br>Thirdly, we must note that confusion comes through failing to distinguish the Holy Spirit's dual work - in creation and universal history on the one hand, and in redemption and salvation history on the other. Ever since the Reformation there has been a tendency in the West to make redemption everything and to ignore creation. The result is that God's work then gets assumed to be always and only redemptive, even when what he is doing is creative. Of course, he is engaged in redemptive work for, in and with the person of Christ and through the preaching of the gospel; that is his great work. But we must never ignore his creative activity. With that background the traditional categories of 'general' and 'special' revelation and 'common' and 'saving' grace are helpful. General revelation is what God reveals of himself by creation, in nature and through conscience. Special revelation is God's revelation in Christ and through prophets and apostles (so through the Bible). Common grace includes all the blessings of this life - the sun shines on the righteous and the unrighteous, after all. Saving grace is salvation and redemption through Christ alone. Much of the inter-faith confusion, surely, comes because general revelation, understood in other religions, is seen to be special and common grace, experienced in other religions, is seen to be saving. <br><br>Fourthly, confusion also can come, and a position of uncritical openness adopted, because of the way religion is often identified with culture. We may, indeed, want to affirm elements of another culture that is shaped by a non-Christian religion. At the same time we may be critical of some (or much) cultural baggage in western Christianity. That is not the same, however, as affirming the truth of that other system of belief and worship. The bottom line has to be for the Christian that nobody comes to the Father but through Christ (John 14:6). <br><br>Fifthly, what we must say is not that God's common grace is never experienced in other religious (or secular) contexts; nor that general revelation is never heeded in other religious (or secular) contexts. But we must assume, nevertheless, the recorded remarks of Jesus that his Father seeks 'true worshippers' (John 4:23). So worship should not only be in spirit but also in truth. For the Christian believer that will rule out misleading 'inter-faith' worship experiences such as sometimes are forced on children.<br><br><b>Post-script</b><br><br>Multi-faithism needs to be resisted. "But are you saying," asks someone, "there should be no dialogue with adherents of other religions?" It depends what you mean by 'dialogue'. E.J. Sharpe in the early days of multi-faithism identified a four-fold ladder of dialogue. He spoke of, one, discursive dialogue (where you share beliefs); two, human dialogue (where you get to know each other as persons); three, secular dialogue (where you engage in joint social or political action); and, four, interior dialogue (where you sink your differences and take on each other's spirituality). There has been a consistent push to descend down this 'ladder'. Many Christians can cope, and cope happily, with those first three rungs. They just deny you can descend to the fourth and retain Christian integrity. You cannot believe and worship as others believe and worship, if Jesus Christ is the only way. Christians believe he is and his resurrection confirms it. David Watson wrote: "The bones of Lenin are in Moscow. The bones of Mohammed are in Medina. The bones of Buddha are in India. But in Jerusalem is the empty tomb." Such a belief is at the heart of the Christian faith. The Bible says: "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Rom 10:9).<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Living Hope">(December 2006) A Living Hope</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2006</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>On Friday 24 November 2006 at Jesmond Parish Church the Funeral Service was conducted for Yemi, Funke (Liz), Abigail and Steven (four members of the Sobo family) who were tragically murdered in their home on 14 November 2006. The following is the address given at the service. The Bible readings were Job 1.13-22 and parts of 1 Corinthians 15. The chief mourner was Mrs Omotunde Sobo (Tunde), the mother of Yemi and Liz and grandmother of Abigail and Steven. She is very happy for others to see this transcript. May we continue to pray for the remaining members of the family in their grief.</i><br><br><b>The tragic experience of Job - the death of all his children</b><br><br>Why does God allow terrible things to happen? And when they do happen is there any hope? At this sad time these are questions people are asking. They are not, however, new questions. <br><br>More than 3000 years ago Job, an ancient sage, asked those same questions. As you heard in the first Bible reading, he lost his livestock and his servants were murdered. Then, his sons and daughters were partying at the oldest brother's house when a great desert storm flattened the house - and all his own children were killed. Then, later on, Job himself suffered a dreadful skin disease. No wonder he was in dark depression and saying, "my days ... are without hope" (chapter 7.4). His friends and their advice made things worse.<br><br><b>A new vision of God</b><br><br>Healing began for Job, however, with a new vision of God (chapters 38-41). He now saw God as the almighty creator of this amazing universe of space and time. Yet he was not just a cold, mechanical deity, but a loving God who cared intimately for Job in all his troubles. Jesus said, he is a God who knows about, and cares even for, the sparrows. So he knew all about Job's children and he knows all about Yemi, Liz, Abigail and Steven. And, of course, he knows all about Tunde (their mother and grandmother) along with other close members of the Sobo family.<br><br>No! God did not immediately solve all Job's problems. And Job needed to learn another lesson. He needed to learn that evil in the world is more than the sum total of individual misdeeds. And this "extra" evil, the Bible says, is to be thought of as an intelligent "he" - a being - rather than an impersonal "it" or force. Indeed, Job chapter 1 speaks of Satan. And in Job's vision there were mythical creatures that suggest chaos and Satan (or the devil). But Job learnt that the evil one does not have the last word. God does. He is still in control. As the New Testament says so clearly, Christ's own death on the Cross "destroy[s] him who holds the power of death - that is, the devil" (Heb 2.14). Yes, there was still mystery. But Job was restored.<br><br><b>The hope of life after death</b><br><br>So there is hope. And Tunde and the family can have hope as they trust in God, amid all the despair. Tunde has asked me to say something on her behalf about what she believes. For she with her family believe in Jesus Christ, who, as you heard in that second Bible reading, "has indeed been raised from the dead". That is the real source of hope. She believes the Resurrection of Jesus Christ gives you hope for life after death if you trust him. "In Christ all will be made alive" for "Death has been swallowed up in victory". She is confident, therefore, as all believers can be, that Christ goes through death with them (John 14.3) and gives them rest and peace. <br><br>First, therefore, Christ gives hope of life after death.<br><br><b>The hope of sins forgiven</b><br><br>Secondly, Christ gives hope for the forgiveness of sins. "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting? The sting of death is sin" (as we heard).<br><br>Death can be terrible. The deepest problem, however, is sin - "the sting of death." But Christ's own terrible death, dying on the cross in your place and mine bearing our sin, means forgiveness. You say, "For any sinner? What about those who commit murder?" The answer is, "yes, if there is repentance." No sin is too bad to be forgiven and no one too good to be forgiven. The great ancestor of Jesus Christ - King David, a hero of the faith, according to the Bible - was both an adulterer and a murderer and he suffered for his sin. But he confessed and was forgiven. Read Psalm 51. <br><br>So Christ gives hope of life after death. Then Christ forgives sins. <br><br><b>The hope of good out of evil</b><br><br>Thirdly, he gives hope for a new beginning by his Holy Spirit. Tunde not only prays that other parents do not have to go through what she had been through, but believes good can come out of evil. For there can be love and peace instead of hatred and anger.<br><br>A woman I have been privileged to meet, in 1967 dived into a shallow lake and her life was changed forever. A spinal cord fracture left her paralyzed from the neck down, and without the use of her hands or legs. First she asked friends to assist her in suicide - to slit her wrists or give her pills to end her misery. Like Job she asked, "how could this demonstrate the love of God or his power?" But then another friend pointed her to Christ. She now says:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>I believe God's purpose in my accident was to turn a stubborn girl into a woman who would reflect patience, endurance and a lively, optimistic hope of heaven.</div></blockquote>

<p>Since then she has had a world-wide ministry of encouraging others to see that God can bring good out of evil. And good can come right away out of this tragic and terrible event. We, too, can trust Christ and then work for good in God's world. <br><br><b>The challenge for today</b><br><br>A funeral service is an occasion for thanking God as we remember all the joy and fun and love in the lives of those who have departed. As Tunde says, these memories give hope and strength.<br><br>But a service like this is also a challenge to us who remain. It is a challenge to face the realities of death and eternity and the judgment seat of Christ. It is a challenge to our faith. <br><br>What do we believe? Do we believe in the Resurrection? When St Paul was writing to the Corinthians, plenty did not believe in such a resurrection. <br><br>We may find it hard to believe, but as we come to know Jesus Christ personally, so we can know and understand. We can see that his resurrection, so clearly evidenced in the Bible, is a foretaste of ours. <br><br>A Funeral Service, therefore, is a challenge to us. And as we respond to that challenge, good can come.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Freedom, The Church and The State">(January 2007) Freedom, The Church and The State</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2007</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>truth</li><li>liberalism</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>How should Christians relate to the State? The following is an updated and edited version of a sermon preached in 2006. Undoubtedly in 2007 there are going to be many issues relating to "religion and public life". To think clearly and respond adequately we need to have a basic understanding of the relationship between Freedom, the Church and the State (DRJH).<br><br><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Freedom in the West is a supreme value. But the State, certainly in Europe, is becoming more and more intrusive. On the one hand, over the last 200 years many have come to believe that human beings should live with virtually no restraints, especially in regard to marriage, sex, human procreation and human dying. Yet, on the other hand, Parliaments and local governments are enacting laws or bringing in regulations that restrict other freedoms and even enforce compliance with immorality. Examples are the banning of Christmas celebrations and the proposed Sexual Orientation Regulations currently going through Parliament. As one social commentator has well said: "Government itself becomes unlimited when liberty itself is thought to be unlimited." <br><br>Many, and not just Christians, are worried as they see things going wrong. They are going wrong because genuine political liberalism is the fruit of the Christian gospel. As that gospel is lost, you lose the freedom that the West (and the world) so cherishes. True freedom comes from facing the truth. Jesus said: "the truth will set you free" (Jn 8.32). Many others today have so relativized "truth" that for them truth has no significant meaning and, therefore, is powerless. For such people "freedom" seems little more than the irrational gratification of immediate desires without obstruction. <br><br>The Biblical view of freedom and the State<br><br>We must start at the very beginning - with the book of Genesis, the Garden of Eden and Genesis 2 verses 15-16:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden'.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>Here was the primeval freedom - "you are free to eat from any tree." This reflects the fact that there are vast areas for choice and freedom in life. But there are also boundaries (verse 17): <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>You must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>The trees are symbolic, but their message is clear. Human freedom has its limits - limits that you are free to ignore but at a price. To transgress those limits means death, later if not sooner, and spiritually and eternally as well as physically. It is as serious as that, and Adam and Eve had to learn that lesson as have all succeeding generations. The tragedy was that Adam and Eve were seduced by the devil's temptation to believe that freedom is absolute, and absolute freedom painless. When the serpent said (Genesis 3.4), "you will not surely die", they believed the serpent and not God. All hell, literally, broke out as you read in the following pages of the Bible. Adam and Eve had started a culture of sin that has affected us all.<br><br>But the Bible then tells us how God, the maker of heaven and earth, started to put things right. He chose Abraham and, through Abraham, the nation of Israel to be a special people. To this people alone he made known his true character of love and mercy as he taught them his will for the right ordering of human life. This divine will concerned the whole of life, public and private. That is evident from the first five books of the Bible, the Prophets and the Wisdom literature. These speak of matters relating to politics, law, economics, hygiene, education as well as religion. Furthermore, all Israel needed to obey God's word and will. Without that obedience the nation would suffer. But did the people consistently obey? No! <br><br>After the Exodus from Egypt and now in the promised land, you read in the book of Judges the refrain, "everyone did as he saw fit." This was licence, or freedom gone wild. However, that statement was preceded by the words: "In those days Israel had no king; [everyone did as he saw fit]" (Judges 21.25). <br><br>You then come to the book of 1 Samuel and the account of Samuel, now old, appointing his own sons as judges. They were a disaster (1 Samuel 8.4-5):<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. They said to him, 'You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>This request, however, for a king was a sign of rebellion against God. Had the people obeyed and kept God's law under the judges, there would have been social order and a strong nation. A king would not have been needed. But they did not obey. Samuel is told by God to appoint a king, nevertheless. At the same time he is to warn the people solemnly and "let them know what the king who will reign over them will do" (verse 9). The rest of chapter 8 is then about the oppression and corruption that kingship will bring. <br><br>The demand for a king, therefore, was the result of Israelite apostasy - of the people of God rejecting and disobeying God. But God, by authorizing kingship, is making provision to control the worst results of human sinfulness. That is what government and state structures are - God's provision to curb the worst excesses of human sin and, as much possible, to encourage what is good. This is the clear teaching of the New Testament. In Romans 13 you are told in verse 1 that the political authorities "have been established by God". What is more, Romans 13 verse 4 says a ruler "is God's servant to do you good." Note five things that follow from this and are related.<br><br>First, if God establishes political leadership with political leaders being his servants, no political authority is finally sovereign. All political authorities are subordinate to God.<br><br>Secondly, political power is not the way to sort out all life's problems and life's basic problems. For that, not social order but lives needs changing. You need the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the King of kings and whose kingdom was and is not of this world (John 18.36).<br><br>Thirdly, political authorities (or the State) alone can use force - whether the force of law or the force of arms. Romans 12 verse 19 says: "Do not take revenge, my friends, [as individuals, that is] but leave room for God's wrath." Chapter 13 then shows that God has delegated his "wrath" (or "avenging") to the State. He authorizes the State alone to use force for punishment.<br><br>Fourthly, and by contrast, the power of the Church does not come from the use of force. Here is one of the great differences between Christianity and Islam. The Christian is only to use the spiritual power of preaching, teaching the gospel, prayer and obedience - obedience to the Great Commission to evangelize and the Great Commandment to love God and then your neighbour. "The gospel … is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes" (Rom 1.16). <br><br>And, fifthly, one day all political and state power will end. The days of freedom for men and women to accept God's free forgiveness through the Cross of Christ and to receive new life by the power of the Holy Spirit will be over. Then, when Christ returns, we will see God's judgment and triumph. That final destiny is not simply for individuals, but also for the entire created order. Romans 8.21 tells us that "the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God."<br><br>Of course, this is beyond human imagination. But our imaginations are helped by thinking not just of redeemed individuals but also of a new heavens, a new earth and a holy city. We are to look forward to this holy city as a new heavenly social order. Meanwhile, as we wait, surely we ought not to ignore God's will for this temporary earthly social order that we now have to fashion. We should, therefore, be concerned with issues such as freedom and the State.<br><br><b>Historical developments</b><br><br>So how have Christians handled these issues over the years? This is only an outline, but the story is something like this. The first three centuries of the Church's life saw Christians as a minority. When necessary, however, they were in the Public Square and refusing to call a Roman emperor "Lord". They knew that Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, alone is Lord. For this refusal many were martyred.<br><br>Then in the 4th century the Emperor (Constantine) became a Christian. He wanted the church to help renew the collapsing pagan society. This meant the church working with a political order it had not created. Also there were now, for people in the Roman Empire, two distinct structures of authority - the Church and the State. Working out that relationship ever since has involved bitter conflicts and is never finished. Right at the start the Church did not want doctrinal disputes settled by the Emperor. But the Emperor wanted doctrinal disputes settled somehow for the sake of political peace and good order. To that end he took some initiatives like convening the Council of Nicea.<br><br>Furthermore, there were differences between the eastern and western parts of the Roman Empire. No longer Rome but Byzantium (modern Istanbul) in the East was the seat of both the Emperor and a patriarch (an eastern "pope" or archbishop). The power of the emperor was, of course, great; so the eastern patriarch became subordinate. This "subordination" in the East has lead the Eastern Orthodox churches sometimes to be too subordinate to the State as in Russia in the 20th century. In the West, however, at Rome, now with no resident Emperor, there was only the Bishop of Rome (or "pope"). His power, therefore, became relatively great - sometimes too great. When in AD 800 a Pope created a rival emperor in the person of Charlemagne, the great schism, or separation, between the Orthodox East and the Catholic West in 1054 was almost bound to happen. <br><br>Then five centuries later came a second great separation - this time within the Western half of Christendom. This separation was the 16th century Reformation. From Constantine's time, faith commitments were often territorial as people followed the beliefs of their leaders (their kings or emperors). But at the Reformation these territorial lines of belief were not so neat and tidy. Believers on both sides of theological divides were living much more side-by-side. So when political leaders tried to force religious uniformity, as in England, the result was bloodshed and civil war. In some areas, therefore, in the 17th century too often Europe saw professing Christian fighting professing Christian.<br><br>But in England, not least from the Puritans who had suffered from the Act of Uniformity of 1662, there was pressure for religious freedom. Men like John Milton saw the need for, and helped secure, press freedom in 1694. Then came John Locke (a pupil of the Puritan John Owen) and his famous Letter of Toleration in 1689. Locke argued that the State should never enforce a particular religious belief. If, however, the ruler was a Christian, as an individual and without the force of the law he should certainly evangelize. Locke was arguing for freedom of thought and belief, not restriction of thought and belief. This toleration, too, was secured; but it was not absolute licence or freedom. In civil society, Locke argued, men committed themselves to various laws and institutions to protect their liberty. "Wherever law ends," wrote Locke, "tyranny begins." So began classical Western liberalism.<br><br>This liberalism, though, never tolerated (in terms of speech) sedition, blasphemy, obscenity or libel; or (in terms of action) sexual licence or allegiance to foreign powers. Most importantly, all was grounded in a belief in God. A great example of this liberal tradition, the US Declaration of Independence, says that "certain unalienable rights" of all people to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are "endowed by their Creator". So lose belief in God, and before long you lose human rights. If man is not seen as made in the image of God but as a throw up of nature, there are no rights. As the 19th century atheist Nietzsche had the honesty to say, "if there is no God, everything goes." And sadly belief in God was being lost in the 19th century. <br><br>At that time the philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote his book On Liberty. He argued that not only thought, belief and speech should be free, but so should all actions, except those resulting in social harm from obvious violence or attack. It took one hundred years for Mill's ideas to gain acceptance. That was because people continued to believe that sexual immorality could still bring moral harm. Mill's acceptance, however, came in 1957 with the British Government's Wolfenden Report on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution. That Report echoed Mill's theory completely and so validated sexual licence in an unprecedented way. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>So we now have increased freedoms; and the State holds that it has no business either with religion or morals - Tony Blair's (or Alistair Campbell's) "we do not do God" (and they certainly do not do Christian morality). The result, however, is not the disestablishment of religion and morals, but the establishment of a new religion and a new immorality. That is because neutrality is impossible. The State in the West now controls education, the electronic media and the therapeutic services. This in turn has led to God and Christian morality having little place in our schools, universities, on the Radio or TV, or in our hospitals, surgeries and clinics. But there has to be some criteria against which problems are solved. By default (and unacknowledged), this criteria now comes from the religion of secular humanism or more precisely materialistic naturalism. And Christians have been allowing this to <br>happen. We have been too passive. But all is changing. Religion and basic morality are coming mainstream. For one thing, social science has now shown that marriage break-ups and sexual immorality brings measurable social harm.<br><br>For religion, a critical date was 1979 when the Ayatollah Khomeini replaced the secular rule of the Shah of Iran. The British Ambassador in Tehran at the time reportedly said that this event would rank, in the perspective of history, with the French Revolution of two centuries earlier. The Muslim resurgence world-wide that has followed certainly means that religion and basic morality are being talked about once again in Parliaments and the Public Square. For Muslims, unlike many Christians, do not say, "we must keep quiet in public about our religious and moral beliefs." They assert them without fear or embarrassment. God seems to be allowing a religion that believes in force and violence to bring judgment on the West. How important, therefore, that Christians should now speak up in public about their own religious and moral beliefs.<br><br><b>The reponse</b><br><br>Jesus answer to how the individual should respond to the State and to the relationship between Church and State, is given in Mark 12. The Pharisees and Herodians were trying to trap Jesus. They asked about the rightness (or not) of paying taxes to Caesar - Mark 12.15: "Should we pay or shouldn't we?" The word for "pay", however, was the word "give". They were asking, literally, "shall we give or shall we not give" taxes (as the Authorized Version translates it)?" - as though taxes were voluntary payments! The issue was the poll-tax. The Romans levied this each year on every adult Jewish male; and it was deeply resented. It was a sign of national subjection. It also had to be paid in coins carrying the Emperor's head. This upset Jewish scruples on "images". So to help ultra-strict Jews special coins were minted without the Emperor's head. "But," verses 15-17... <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>... Jesus knew their hypocrisy. 'Why are you trying to trap me?' he asked. 'Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.' They brought the coin, and he asked them, 'Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?' 'Caesar's,' they replied. Then Jesus said to them, 'Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>Jesus knew that their scruples were not real. He knew that the denarius was in regular use in Judea and would have been in their pockets. It was. By showing Jesus the coin, these people admitted they were accepting all the benefits of Roman economic stability and political order. They, therefore, had a duty to pay the tax. So Jesus says in verse 17, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's". But Jesus' word "give" is not the simple word for "give" used earlier but a compound word meaning "give back" or "pay back what is due". The Authorized Version translates it as "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's". It is a duty. So, our first response in practical terms is to contribute to State power - for money is power. We then have a duty as Christian citizens to work for that power being used rightly and morally, as much as we can.<br><br>Our second response is to understand that on the one hand God provides fallible institutions like the State and civil government for our good. We, indeed, need Caesar (or his equivalent) in this fallen world. Some like the Zealots in Jesus' day, and many Muslims today, would deny that. They deny the legitimacy of Caesar. But that is the way to the loss of legitimate freedoms. <br><br>On the other hand, Jesus is saying "No!" to any who deny the legitimacy of God in the Public Square. This is done by those millions in the West who aggressively embrace Godless secular humanism or materialistic naturalism. It is also a "No!" to those who believe that Caesar and mere social change will solve life's basic problems. They will not. For that you need the gospel of sins forgiven and new spiritual life. Yes, when Caesar orders what God forbids or forbids what God orders, Caesar has to be disobeyed (Acts 5.29), otherwise we are to submit to the State. <br><br>And we are to pray for "Caesar" and the State. That is to be our third response - 1 Timothy 2.1-4 says: <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone - for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Saviour, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>Good social order is related to salvation. When the State restrains human sin, you have better conditions for preaching the gospel of sins forgiven and new spiritual life.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>And remember, whatever you pray for you ought to work for. That is why you should make use of, and support, the Christian Institute and other Christian agencies like the Christian Medical Fellowship and the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship who are also concerned, and work, for true freedom and a more godly State.<br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Roman Catholic Stand Over Homosexual Adoption">(February 2007) The Roman Catholic Stand Over Homosexual Adoption</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2007</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Parliament is at present considering the new Sexual Orientation Regulations. At the end of January 2007 it became clear that these will mean a significant restriction of Religious Liberties.<br><br>The Roman Catholic Church’s stand over homosexual adoption has highlighted the potential problems. The Church wants an "opt-out" to allow it to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation in their adoption service. On 26 January 2007 it was reported in the <i>Church Times</i> that "the Archbishops of Canterbury and York back the Roman Catholic Church’s appeal to be exempted from a law requiring agencies to consider gay couples as adoptive parents. 'The rights of conscience cannot be made subject to legislation, however well-meaning,' the Archbishops wrote to the Prime Minister on Tuesday (i.e. 23 January 2007)."<br><br>The debate so far, however, has focused only on the "conscience" and "religious beliefs" as though the Christian conscience and beliefs had no basis in matters of fact. This, of course, is not true. For there is evidence that children are adversely affected by homosexual parenting. Sadly, and seriously, the best interests of the child are not being debated and evidence that we have is being ignored.<br><br>To help with the debate, my wife Joy, a Paediatrician and specialist in adoption and fostering, wrote a short letter in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, published as <i>Lesbian Parenting may make a Difference.</i> That can be read in the <i>BMJ,</i> 24 August 2002, p. 443. A longer article by Joy, <i>Homosexual Parenting: Does it Make a Difference? - a re-evaluation of the research with adoption and fostering in mind</i> was published in The Churchman vol 117.No.1 2003 (this can now be down loaded from <a href="http://www.christian.">http://www.christian.</a> org.uk/html-publications/homosexualparenting.htm). Below, however, in the following pages and as another contribution to the debate, is a section from my book, <i>Church and State in the New Millennium,</i> London, HarperCollins, 2000, pp. 19-26. <br><br><b>Lesbian Adoption in Newcastle</b><br><br>[Extract begins] I was asked in 1998 to conduct the funeral of an elderly lady. In preparation for the service I had to contact her daughter. In conversation over the telephone the daughter said, 'By the way, I know your wife.'<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>Oh! How is that?' I asked. 'Do you remember "the lesbian adoption case"?' she replied.'Yes, indeed I do.' 'Well, I am the foster mother who adopted the little boy.' </div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>On visiting the family and never having met 'the foster mother' before, I found a remarkable woman together with her son, known in the press as the 'little boy', but now growing up, integrated in what seemed a happy family and with normal life chances. But it could have been so very different. Thereby hangs a moral tale, indeed it provides a cameo of the moral and social environment we have inherited at the start of the twenty-first century.<br><br>The story began in Newcastle upon Tyne, in the Autumn of 1990. Brian Roycroft, a top social worker with a national reputation, was the Director of Social Services for Newcastle. Just before his retirement in 1993 he was questioned on Tyne-Tees TV about some of the most difficult times he had had to face in his long career. There was first the Mary Bell tragedy of 1968, when a young disturbed Tyneside child had brutally murdered two other young children. At the time it shook the whole of Britain. Secondly, there was the lesbian adoption scandal of 1990.<br><br>The scandal started quite innocently. An article in the <i>Sunday Express</i> on 30 September 1990 reported that eight local authorities admitted to placing children for foster care with homosexual couples. The paper had contacted 133 authorities and found that, in addition to the eight, a further 91 local authorities said they would not rule out homosexual placements. Only five claimed they would rule them out (29 refused to comment or did not reply). <br><br>Almost in passing, the article then stated that two lesbians were adopting (not just fostering) a boy under the age of 10 in Newcastle.<br><br>The following day the local Newcastle press picked up the story and made it headline news. How did the Director of Social Services, Bryan Roycroft, respond? According to the <i>Evening Chronicle,</i> he said that 'the decision to place the child with the lesbian couple was made after a nation-wide search'. He added that his department 'would always act in the best interests of the child'.1  According to <i>The Journal,</i> the then Chairman of Newcastle Social Services Committee said that the boy was handicapped and that the only alternative to the placement with the lesbian couple 'was long-term care in a hospital or institution'.2  In the same paper Bryan Roycroft himself was also quoted as saying that the child would have 'a quality of life he would never experience in a hospital or institution.' Another journalist was told that the Director of Social Services had 'sought the views of a High Court judge, a child psychiatrist, and an adult psychiatrist before deciding.' <br><br>Then on 6 October 1990 <i>The Times</i> newspaper on 6 October 1990 reported that the lesbian couple had been approved (and so promoted) by the famous charity Barnardo's, something that shook many Christian people. Thomas Barnardo, the founder, was a great evangelical philanthropist of the nineteenth century who had worked with destitute children. <br><br>This is what the public were told, and people therefore believed that the little boy had been placed for adoption with a lesbian couple as an alternative to life in an institution or a hospital. Then came the bombshell.<br><br><b>Exposure</b><br><br>On 8 October an irate foster mother told the press that she had fostered the boy for two and a half years, since he was a tiny baby. Not only that, she had applied to adopt him herself after learning that another couple had applied to adopt the child. Her application, however, had been turned down and the boy was taken away and placed for adoption with this lesbian couple. It was believed that one of the lesbians was a social worker herself and the other had worked for Newcastle City Council. It was also discovered that the foster mother had had considerable experience, fostering a total of 30 children over a period of 19 years.<br><br>The public could not believe what it was hearing. <i>The Evening Chronicle</i> said, 'the stories don't add up.' The comments made by the foster mother called into question the 'claim that but for the willingness of the lesbian couple to provide him with a home, this toddler would have faced a life of institutional care'.3<br><br>Further controversy was generated when one of the two Medical Advisers to the Newcastle Adoption and Fostering Unit - my wife, Dr Joy Holloway, a paediatrician who specializes in the field of adoption and fostering - wrote to a local newspaper stating that, as a matter of policy, 'accepting practising lesbian or male homosexuals as foster or adoptive parents' was not 'appropriate' and it was 'not only morally wrong but unkind'. Furthermore, she wrote, 'I have expressed this opinion strongly to the Chief Executive and to the Director of Social Services over the past six months, saying that I believe such a policy should not be introduced without an open airing in the full City Council'.<br><br>I only learnt about this case from the press, however, through the chance but thorough investigative work of a <i>Sunday Express</i> journalist. At that point I took action and decided to fight the case publicly along with the Newcastle-based Christian Institute with which I was (and still am) involved. But I could learn nothing at all from my wife, who is the model of discretion and a believer in proper confidentiality. There was, however, no problem in finding out the facts from many friendly local and national journalists. What I learnt day by day, in my judgment, was disgraceful. What became clear was this: once you set out on a course of action that involves respecting, rewarding and so validating sexual immorality, soon in its wake come misinformation, half-truths and bad decisions.<br><br>How was the dispute resolved? In January 1991 the case reached the High Court which ordered the little boy to be returned to the foster mother. What went on behind those closed doors we do not know. The public had only the thinnest of press statements to go on, agreed by the court and Newcastle Social Services. It revealed nothing about the judge's views on lesbian adoption and fostering, one way or the other. <br><br><b>The Issues</b><br><br>Sadly, the debate has not ended. In his pre-retirement interview, Bryan Roycroft said the real problem with the Newcastle case was that the public were not ready for lesbian adoption 'yet'. This case was simply one of the first shots in a major campaign to legitimize lesbian adoption and fostering that had been orchestrated by gay pressure groups. <br><br>In the light of our experience in Newcastle, my wife and I were asked by a senior MP to meet the British Secretary of State for Health who was consulting over these issues. We discussed the dangers of lesbian adoption and fostering and how it was not in the best interests of the child. The Secretary of State seemed genuinely pleased to see us. We discovered that in the period of consultation (now ending), we were the only people who in face-to-face discussion had represented the common-sense, traditional and Christian position - the one that the polls said was held by the overwhelming majority of the British public. The other representations had been from gay activists or their sympathizers. <br><br>No one, therefore, had detailed the problems children experience in lesbian households - the problem of secrecy; of other children responding negatively; of a sense of difference; of not being close to other children; of girls thinking of turning to other women sexually after boy-friend trouble; of a lack of peer support; of boys having anger towards the female lover and saying the mother's lover had become 'a threat to my sense of family,' or simply identifying the major problem as the lover - 'she sleeps with my mother.'4  Nor had it been detailed how one study found that in lesbian households 'older boys were significantly less confident about their popularity with other boys', and 'older girls' were more 'masculine'. They 'were more likely to mention a man as someone they would like to be like when grown.'5<br><br>The agenda of homosexual adoption and fostering is being vigorously pursued as we enter the new millennium. It must be stopped. Children in care do need families, some desperately - but not any family. And if potential carers are excluded because they hold to the Christian ethic - for example, that homosexual adoption and fostering is wrong - no wonder there is a childcare problem. It may be that on some measurements two educated, middle class lesbians, score better in parenting skills than a less educated single mother. But the problems in lesbian fostering and adoption are not so much the lack of parenting skills: they are in the relationship of the child to the outside world. The problem is summed up in one clinical study as follows: 'Even under the best of circumstances, children in gay step-families may experience difficulty since it is not easy for them to grow up in a family that is disapproved of by society and to be labelled as pathological or undesirable by association.'6<br><br>To read the paper summarizing existing research by the pro-gay Saralie Pennington, 'Children of Lesbian Mothers', leads to the only conclusion that it is cruel placing children with lesbian couples. She reports that children 'commonly fear that other children will find out that their mother is a lesbian. This awareness frequently occurs after seven years of age and intensifies during pubescence and the early teenage years.' 7<br><br>A fostered or adopted child would be forced to live with these fears for six or seven years. We are also told that 'children may fear being ostracized and isolated if their mothers' sexual orientation becomes known ... Girls, more than boys, commonly fear that they, too, will be gay or that people will think they are gay.' And then she says, 'Out of fear of discovery of their mothers homosexuality, these children can become anxious, withdrawn, hypervigilant, or secretive, and may attempt to control their mothers' behaviour. Some children, particularly as they approach their teens, shy away from friends and refuse to bring them home out of concern that someone will "find out".8<br><br>All this is put down - by gay propaganda and commentators like Saralie Pennington - to 'dysfunctionality' not from homosexual behaviours (which are axiomatically held to be healthy and normal) but from other aspects of family dynamics and especially from the 'profound impact of a homophobic culture.'9  The communal wisdom of human society as it has evolved over the centuries is not entertained as even possibly correct. This says that it is in the best interests of a child to have a mother and father, not two mothers or two fathers who are in a sexual relationship.<br><br><b>1983 Study</b><br><br>It is difficult to know what would ever count as 'proof positive'. In the UK one academic survey was often quoted in the 1980s and 1990s to claim that children could happily be reared in lesbian households. It was a 1983 study by Susan Golombok and others, called 'Children in Lesbian and Single Parent Households'. It was claimed that this proved that 'rearing in a lesbian household per se did not lead to atypical psycho-sexual development or constitute a psychiatric risk factor.' 10<br><br>This study and conclusion was cited regularly on TV and in various debates as watertight evidence. For many in the UK it undoubtedly legitimized homosexual parenting. However, it was not commonly pointed out that the conclusions and deductions from the study, if true, would only mean that children in lesbian households did no worse than children in father-absent single-parent households. Nor was it pointed out that the mean age of the children in this study was 9.5 years old. This is far too young to see long-term emotional and psychiatric effects, or to see how the children coped with puberty. Nor was it pointed out that the lesbian mothers were more educated and 'professional' than the control group. Nor was it pointed out that both groups of children had much higher rates of emotional and behavioural problems than those in the general population.<br><br>Golombok's 1996 follow-up study on these children as young adults - such as it was - showed that one quarter of the young adults from her lesbian households became involved 'in same-gender sexual relationships', whereas none of the participants from the heterosexual single-parent backgrounds did so - 'a significant difference'. That compares with only 2 per cent of this age group in the general population who have ever had a homosexual relationship.11  The study also reported that two-thirds of the daughters from lesbian households and over half the sons 'significantly ... stated that they had previously considered, or thought it a future possibility, that they might experience same-gender attraction or have a same-gender sexual relationship or both'. That compared with only one-sixth of all the young adults from the heterosexual control group. The results of this study, therefore, suggest that the homosexuality of two lesbian parents is associated with homosexuality in the children - something many deny.12  [Extract ends]<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The above was written in 1999. Things, sadly, have moved on. But surely we cannot ignore what is happening; and we must work for change. To underline the seriousness of harming children, Jesus used extreme language. He said, "if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea" (Mat 18.6). It is, therefore, very serious if we adopt policies and practices that are not only not in the best interests of children but have positive adverse effects. <br><br><br><b>Footnotes</b><br><br>1 Evening Chronicle, 1 October 1990<br><br>2 The Journal, 2 October 1990<br><br>3 Evening Chronicle, 8 October 1990<br><br>4 Karen Gail Lewis, 'Children of Lesbians: their Point of View', Social Work 1980: 25, pp. 198-203<br><br>5 R.

                <p>Cranmer’s Sixteenth Century Homily (one of the doctrinal standards<br>of the Church of England) edited and in modern English<br><br><b>PART 1 </b><br><br>For a Christian there is nothing more necessary or profitable than the knowledge of Holy Scripture. In it is contained God’s true word, setting forth his glory and also man’s duty. <br><br><b>The one thing necessary</b><br><br>All truth or doctrine necessary for our justification and everlasting salvation is, or may be, drawn out of this fountain and well of truth. Therefore, all who desire to enter into the right and perfect way to God, must apply their minds to know Holy Scripture. Without so doing they can neither sufficiently know God and his will nor their own responsibilities and duties. <br><br>As drink is pleasant to those who thirst and food to those who are hungry, so is the reading, hearing, searching and studying of Holy Scripture to those who desire to know God or themselves and to do his will. Those hating and rejecting the heavenly knowledge and food of God’s word are so drowned in worldly vanities that they neither sense God nor any godliness. That is the cause why they desire such vanities rather than the true knowledge of God.<br><br>When people who are sick or ill eat or drink something that is pleasant, its taste can be unpleasant not because of the food, but because of the illness that affects their tongues and mouths. So the sweetness of God’s word is not bitter in itself, but only to those who have their minds corrupted with the long custom of sin and love of this world.<br><br>Therefore we must forsake the corrupt judgments of worldly people who care only for this physical world. Let us reverently hear and read Holy Scripture which is the food of the soul. Let us diligently search for the fresh water of life for our justification and salvation in the books of the New and Old Testaments and not rush to the muddy ponds of human traditions, devised by men’s imagination. In Holy Scripture is fully contained what we ought to do and what to avoid; what to believe, what to love and what to look for at God’s hands in good measure. <br><br><b>Knowing ourselves and knowing God</b><br><br>In these books we will find the Father from whom, the Son by whom, and the Holy Spirit in whom, all things have their being and hold together. These three Persons are but one God and one substance.<br><br>In these books we may learn to know ourselves and how bad and needing mercy we are. We may learn also to know God and how good he is in himself, and how he makes us and all creatures partakers of his goodness. We may learn also in these books to know God’s will and pleasure, as much as is right for us to know at this present time. As the great clergyman and godly preacher, St. John Chrysostom, says:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>whatsoever is required to the salvation of man, is fully contained in the Scripture of God. He that is ignorant may there learn and have knowledge. He that is hard-hearted and an obstinate sinner shall there find everlasting torments, prepared with God’s justice to make him afraid and to mollify (or soften) him. He that is oppressed with misery in this world shall there find relief in the promises of everlasting life - to his great consolation and comfort. He that is wounded by the Devil unto death, shall find there medicine whereby he may be restored again unto health." </div></blockquote>

<p><br>Elsewhere St Chrysostom says:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>if it is required to teach any truth or reprove false doctrine, to rebuke any vice, to commend any virtue, to give good counsel, to comfort or to exhort, or to do any other thing requisite for our salvation - all these things we may learn plentifully in the Scriptures.</div></blockquote>

<p><br>Fulgentius says:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>“There is abundantly enough both for men to eat and children to suck. There is whatsoever is fitting for all ages and for all degrees and sorts of men.”</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br><b>The benefits of the Bible</b><br><br>These books, therefore, ought to be often in our hands, in our eyes, in our ears, in our mouths, but most of all in our hearts. For the Scripture of God is the heavenly meat for our souls. Hearing and keeping it makes us blessed, sanctifies us and makes us holy. It converts our souls; it is a lamp to our feet; it is a sure, steadfast, and everlasting instrument of salvation; it gives wisdom to the humble and lowly hearts; it comforts, makes glad, cheers, and guards our consciences. It is a more excellent jewel or treasure than any gold or precious stone. It is more sweet than honey or a honey-comb. It is called "the best part", which Mary chose. For it has in it everlasting comfort. <br><br>The words of Holy Scripture are called words of everlasting life. They are God’s instrument, ordained for that same purpose. They have power for change, through God’s promises. They are effective through God’s assistance. When they are received in a faithful heart, they have always a heavenly spiritual working in them. They are lively, living and mighty in operation and sharper than any two-edged sword, "and enter through, even unto the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, of the joints and the marrow."<br><br>Christ calls him a wise builder who builds upon his word, upon his sure and substantial foundation. By this word of God we shall be judged: for the word which I speak, says Christ, will condemn at the last day. He who keeps the word of Christ is promised the love and favour of God and that he will be the dwelling-place or temple of the blessed Trinity. Whoever diligently reads this word, and prints in his heart what he reads, will find lessened the great affection for the transitory things of this world while the great desire for heavenly things, that God promises in his word, will be increased. <br><br><b>The secret of godliness</b><br><br>There is nothing so much that strengthens our faith and trust in God, and that keeps up innocence and pureness of heart and also of outward godly life and lifestyle, as continual reading and recording of God’s word. What is deeply printed and written on the heart by continual reading of Holy Scripture and diligently searching, at length almost becomes part of our nature. Moreover, the good effect of God’s word illumines the ignorant, and gives more light to those who faithfully and diligently read it. It comforts their hearts and encourages them to perform what God commands. It teaches patience in all adversity and in prosperity humbleness. It teaches what honour is due unto God and what mercy and love to our neighbour. It gives good advice in all doubtful things. It shows to whom we should look for aid and help in all dangers. It shows that God is the only giver of victory in all battles with, and temptations from, our enemies, both physical and spiritual. <br><br>In reading God’s word, it is not the person that always profits most who is most ready to read it or can recite it from memory. Rather it is the person who most enters into it; who is most inspired by the Holy Spirit; who is most altered in his heart and life and changed into what he is reading; who is daily less and less proud, less angry, less covetous, and less desiring worldly and vain pleasures; and who daily forsakes his old bad life. He increases in goodness more and more. <br><br>To be brief - there is nothing that more maintains godliness of mind and drives away ungodliness than the continual reading or hearing of God’s word, if it be joined with a godly mind and a good desire to know and follow God’s will. For without an honest and pure intention and a godly mind, nothing is allowed for good before God. And, on the other side, nothing more darkens Christ and the glory of God nor brings in more blindness and all kinds of evil than the ignorance of God’s word.<br><br><b>PART 2</b><br><br>In the first part of this Sermon that encourages the knowledge of Holy Scripture, it was declared why the knowledge of Scripture is necessary and profitable to all; and how, by the true knowledge and understanding of Scripture, the most necessary points of our duty towards God and our neighbours are also known. There is now more to say concerning these matters as follows.<br><br><b>Ignorance</b><br><br>If we profess Christ, why are we not ashamed to be ignorant of his teaching - for everyone is ashamed to be ignorant in the area of his profession? A man is ashamed to be called a Philosopher who does not read books of philosophy, or be called a Lawyer, an Astronomer, or a Doctor, who is ignorant of the books of law, astronomy and medicine. How can any man, then, say that he professes Christ and his religion, if he will not apply himself to read and hear, and so to know, the books of Christ’s Gospel and doctrine (as far as he can or it is possible)? Although other sciences are good and to be learned, yet no one can deny that this teaching is supreme and immeasurably surpasses all else.<br><br>What excuse shall we, therefore, make at the last day before Christ, if we delight to read or hear men’s fantasies and fictions, more than Christ's most holy Gospel; and if we find no time to do what chiefly, above all things, we should do; and if we will rather read other things than that for which we should rather leave off reading all other things? Let us, therefore, as many as profess God and have faith and trust in him, and as much as we have time and leisure - let us apply ourselves to know God’s word by diligent hearing and reading. <br><br><b>Empty excuses</b><br><br>But those that have no real concern for God’s word underline their fault by often alleging two empty and pretended excuses. Some try to excuse themselves by claiming their own frailties and fearfulness. They say that they dare not read Holy Scripture, lest through their ignorance they fall into any error. Others pretend that the difficulty in understanding it, and the hardness of the text, is so great that only clergy and academics can read it.<br><br>With regard to the first excuse: ignorance of God’s word is the cause of all error, as Christ himself affirmed to the Sadducees. He said that they erred, because they did not know the Scriptures. How will these, then, avoid error who will still be ignorant of them? And how will they escape ignorance who will not read or hear the very thing that will give them knowledge? <br><br>The person who now has most knowledge was at first ignorant. Yet they never refused to read for fear of falling into error. Rather they diligently read lest they should remain in ignorance and, through ignorance, in error. If you will not know the truth of God (a thing most necessary for you) lest you fall into error, by the same reasoning you must stay in bed and never go out, lest if you do, you fall into a ditch; you must not eat any good food, lest you eat too much; you must not sow your corn, or work at your job, or invest your money, for fear you lose your seed, your job or your investment. So, by that reasoning, it would be best for you to live idly and never undertake any good thing, lest perhaps some evil may occur. <br><br><b>The need for humility</b><br><br>If you are afraid to fall into error by reading Holy Scripture, I will show you how you may read it without the danger of error. Read it humbly, with a meek and lowly heart, so that you may glorify God and not yourself with the knowledge of it. Read it each day praying to God that he will direct your reading to good effect. And do not try to expound it further than you can plainly understand it. As St. Augustine says, the knowledge of Holy Scripture is a great, large, and a high place; but the door is very low so that the high and arrogant man cannot run in. Whoever wants to enter in must stoop low and humble himself.<br><br>Presumption and arrogance are the mother of all error. Humility needs to fear no error. Humility will only search to know the truth. It will search and will bring together one place with another; and where it cannot find out the meaning, it will pray; it will ask of others who know; and it will not presumptuously and rashly define anything it does not know. Therefore, the humble may search any truth boldly in the Scripture without the danger of error. If they are ignorant, they ought to read more and search Holy Scripture to bring them out of ignorance. Yes, a person may profit with only hearing but they may profit more with both hearing and reading. <br><br><b>Difficult passages</b><br><br>So much regarding the fear of reading because of a person's ignorance - now concerning the hardness of Scripture: one who is so weak that they cannot eat strong meat may, however, drink sweet and tender milk and then wait until they grow stronger and come to more knowledge. God receives the learned and unlearned and casts no one away, but treats all the same. The Scripture is full of low valleys and plain ways that are easy for everyone to use and walk in, as it also has high hills and mountains which few can climb. St John Chrysostom says:<br><br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>Whoever gives their mind to Holy Scripture with diligent study and a burning desire, will not be left without help. For either God Almighty will send him some godly teacher to teach him, as he did to instruct the Eunuch, a nobleman of Ethiopia and treasurer of Queen Candace. The Eunuch had a great desire to read the Scripture, although he did not understand it. Because of his desire for God’s word, God sent his Apostle Philip to declare to him the true sense of the Scripture that he read. Or else, if we lack a learned man to instruct and teach us, yet God himself, from above, will give light to our minds and teach us those things which are necessary for us and of which we are ignorant.</div></blockquote>

<p><br>In another place Chrysostom says that <br></p>

<blockquote><div>man’s human and worldly wisdom or science is not necessary to the understanding of Scripture but rather the revelation of the Holy Spirit is needed, who inspires the true meaning to those who search for it with humility and diligence.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br>He that asks shall have and he that seeks shall find and he that knocks shall have the door opened. "If we read once, twice, or three times and do not understand, let us not cease, but still continue reading, praying, and asking of others; and so by still knocking, at last the door will be opened," as St. Augustine says. <br><br><b>Sufficiently clear</b><br><br>Although many things in the Scripture be spoken in obscure mysteries, yet there is nothing spoken as a dark mystery in one place, but the self-same thing is spoken more easily and plainly in other places. So both the learned and unlearned can receive it. <br><br>It is everyone's duty to learn and to print in their memories, and to put positively into practice those things in the Scripture that are easy to understand and necessary for salvation. As for the dark mysteries we are to be contented to be ignorant about them until such time as it shall please God to open them to us. In the mean time, if someone lacks either the ability or the opportunity, God will not charge it to their folly.<br><br>But the person with ability should not cease their efforts because some others are unable to understand. Nevertheless, for the hardness of such difficult places, the reading of the whole should not be neglected. <br><br>And briefly to conclude: as St. Augustine says, "By the Scripture all men are amended; weak men are strengthened, and strong men are comforted." Surely no one will be hostile to the reading of God’s word except those who either are so ignorant that they do not know how wholesome it is; or else they are so sick that they hate the perfect medicine that will heal them; or they are so ungodly that they wish people to continue still in blindness and ignorance of God.<br><br><b>Summary</b><br><br>So we have briefly touched on some part of the realities of God’s holy word, one of God’s greatest benefits given (and declared) to mankind here on earth. <br><br>Let us thank God heartily for this his great and special gift, beneficial favour and fatherly providence. Let us be glad to receive this precious gift of our heavenly Father. Let us hear, read, and know these holy rules, injunctions, and statutes of our Christian religion to which we have made profession to God at our baptism. <br><br>Let us, with fear and reverence, lay up, in the recesses of our hearts, these necessary and fruitful lessons. Let us night and day muse and meditate and contemplate them. Let us ruminate, and, as it were, chew the cud, that we may have the sweet juice, spiritual effect, marrow, honey, kernel, taste, comfort, and consolation of them. Let us be at peace and check our consciences with the most infallible certainty, truth, and perpetual assurance of them. Let us pray to God, the only author of these heavenly studies, that we may speak, think, believe, live, and depart from this world, according to the wholesome doctrine and truths of them. <br><br>By that means, in this world we shall have God’s defence, favour, and grace, with the unspeakable solace of peace and quietness of conscience; and, after pity needed in this life, we shall enjoy the endless bliss and glory of heaven, which he who died for us all grants us all, Jesus Christ, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, be all honour and glory, both now and everlastingly. <i>Amen.</i><br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Resurrection - Spiritual or Physical?">(April 2007) The Resurrection - Spiritual or Physical?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2007</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>On 29 April 1984 the Bishop-designate of Durham, David Jenkins appeared on Channel 4's <i>Credo</i> religious TV programme. The journalist Philip Whitehead was interviewing David Jenkins, the Bishop-to-be, and asked him about "the most important miracle in the whole story of Jesus, the story of the Resurrection." <br><br>His question was simple: "Do you hold the view that Jesus rose from the dead and ascended into heaven?" The reply was as follows:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>Well, I hold the view that he rose from the dead. The question is what that means, isn't it? I think I should like to say that it doesn't seem to me, reading the records as they remain in both the Gospels and what Paul says in 1 Corinthians, that there was any one event which you could identify with the Resurrection. What seems to me to have happened is that there were a series of experiences which gradually convinced a growing number of the people who became apostles that Jesus had certainly been dead, certainly buried and he wasn't finished. And what is more he wasn't just not finished but he was "raised up", that is to say, the very life and power and purpose and personality which was in him was actually continuing and was continuing both in the sphere of God and in the sphere of history so that he was a risen and living presence and possibility.</div></blockquote>

<p>A little later, the Bishop-designate of Durham was being interviewed on the BBC. This time the interviewer was David Brown. He referred to the empty tomb and said that the new bishop seemed to be saying that it is not essential for a Christian to believe in the empty tomb of Jesus. To which David Jenkins replied:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>Well, that is absolutely right, because even if you did, no single historical fact can be certain. And secondly, no single historical fact can prove anything. I mean, historical facts are a matter of probability and doubt and uncertainty. Faith is to do with assurance that the people who bear witness to these facts have a conviction which we can share.</div></blockquote>

<p>And when the interviewer mentioned the virginal conception of Jesus and his empty tomb and asked: "isn't their inclusion in the New Testament ... evidence of certainty", the Bishop-designate replied:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>Certainly not! There is absolutely no certainty in the New Testament about anything of importance.</div></blockquote>

<p>Following these claims, a number of clergy in the North East of England especially, but also throughout England, attempted to stop the appointment of David Jenkins as Bishop of Durham. This was without success. <br><br>However, subsequent action that was taken in the General Synod was successful. It reversed the theologically liberal conclusion of the House of Bishops that the empty tomb only "<i>expressed</i> the faith of the Church of England". The House of Clergy and the House of Laity both voted that the empty tomb "<i>was</i> the faith of the Church of England".<br><br>But the former Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins continued to sow doubts when in office. His conclusion was this: <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>I personally do not know whether the grave was empty or not. The evidence of the texts, the nature of the tradition and the general facts about the way people all over the world rapidly believe appropriate stories to support the religious beliefs leave me wholly uncertain about the Empty Tomb as literal historical fact." </div></blockquote>

<p>To counter David Jenkins false teaching I was asked to write a book (<i>The Church of England - where is it going?</i>) and one or two shorter pieces. I have included one of these below under title <i>The Empty Tomb</i>.<br><br><i>Tom Wright</i><br><br>Then following what I have written, I have included a piece by the present Bishop of Durham, Tom Wright, under the title <i>What happened at the Resurrection?</i> <br><br>This is a scholarly piece that I consider helpful and that I am grateful Tom Wright has written. He teaches the very opposite to his predecessor and robustly defends the empty tomb and the "bodily" resurrection of Jesus. When Tom Wright was Bishop-designate in 2003, he wrote this article for the <i>Church Times</i>. The editor of the <i>Church Times</i> kindly has given his permission for it to be included in the <i>Coloured Supplement</i> (the <i>Church Times</i> can be accessed on the web at www.churchtimes.co.uk).<br><br>A number of people are currently in disagreement with Tom Wright over his criticism of the new "Covenant for the Church of England" signed by many evangelical church leaders, including John Stott. This "covenant" is seeking reform in the light of the heretical teachings of some of the bishops. I, too, as a signatory to the covenant, disagree with what Tom Wright has written. But I always remember J.C.Ryle's comment when Ryle was writing about Paul's strong disagreement with Peter at Antioch. That was when Peter seemed not to have grasped the true meaning of "justification by faith". You read in Galatians 2 how Peter had so got things wrong that he refused to eat with the Gentiles. Ryle writes: <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>who does not see, when he reads the history of the Church of Christ, repeated proofs that the best of men can err? ... The Reformers were honoured instruments in the hand of God for reviving the cause of truth on earth. Yet hardly one of them can be named who did not make some great mistake.</div></blockquote>

<p>Peter, obviously, later changed his mind; and obviously I hope Tom Wright will change his mind about the covenant. What he says, however, about the Resurrection of Jesus should be judged on its own merits.<br><br><br><b>"THE EMPTY TOMB" by David Holloway</b><br><br>The Resurrection - the New Testament doctrine of the Resurrection, not a post-modern reconstruction of it - lies at the heart of the Christian faith. "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9). But was this not just a "spiritual" resurrection of Jesus rather than a "physical" resurrection?<br><br>Of course, the Resurrection of Jesus was not a crude resuscitation of a corpse; it was a glorious transformation. In that sense his old "flesh and blood" (to use Paul's phrase) did not inherit the new order of "the Kingdom of God" (1 Corinthians 15:50). But what Paul implies and the New Testament elsewhere makes quite clear is that on the first Easter morning Jesus' tomb was found empty; and it was found empty because Jesus had risen. To suggest that it does not matter if the bones of Jesus are still in the soil of Palestine is clearly contrary to the plain meaning of the texts and is, therefore, dangerous heresy and needs to be opposed. <br><br>People who still want to use the language of "resurrection" while denying the empty tomb have to say that the empty tomb is a myth. That is to say, they present it as a story concocted to illustrate the meaning of "resurrection". But that is not what the Bible teaches. According to the text of the Bible, the empty tomb is clearly not just an <i>illustration of the meaning</i> of the Resurrection; it is the <i>evidence for</i> the Resurrection.<br><br>If you believe the empty tomb is merely a visual aid, it will be of no essential significance. Belief in it, even though well grounded, will be held to be secondary or optional. That is the view of the former Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins. He argued that the empty tomb is a symbol of "the assertion, made by God and received by faith, that in this world, through this world and beyond this world we may be sure that in the end, love succeeds, love brings it off, love has the last word. Jesus, the flesh and blood expression of down-to-earth love is at the very 'right hand of God'." <br><br>But that is to destroy meanings. The words sound so good (if you can understand them), yet they reduce the Resurrection to a platitude about love. Yes, "love" is vital. God, indeed, is love. But the Resurrection of Jesus is saying more than just that - true though it is.<br><br>It was the philosopher Wittgenstein who said that you could trace the breakdown in religious belief to a "credit rating decline" in the concepts that we use. Such reductionism has been and is destroying the credit rating of the Resurrection.<br><br>This "new theology" is not the position of the Christian Church down the centuries. It is not the faith that countless men and women have lived and died for. They knew that had the tomb <i>not</i> been empty everything that they affirmed would have been falsified. If Jesus' remains had still been in the tomb, only the extremes of Gnosticism could have believed that death had lost its sting and the grave had lost its victory.<br><br><i>The New Testament</i><br><br>How, though, can we be sure that the tomb <i>was</i> empty? Is the evidence of the texts not rather weak? The main textual evidence for the empty tomb is there in the Gospel narratives - the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. But the argument is sometimes put forward that the Resurrection accounts are all so different and therefore cannot be reliable. What do we say to this?<br><br>It is true that the Resurrection narratives are different in the four Gospels. But the basic difference lies in the accounts of the appearances of Jesus to the disciples, not in the accounts of how women (and others) found the tomb of Jesus empty. It is not at all strange, in any case, that the Gospel writers have different accounts of the appearances of Jesus to his disciples. Different apostles most probably reported different appearances on different occasions. On the other hand, it is quite remarkable how similar the accounts of the empty tomb are in all four Gospels. There is an amazing unanimity. <br><br>The three Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) all agree on three things:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>1) that some women, including Mary Magdalene, went to the tomb of Jesus on the first day of the week and found the stone rolled away from the tomb's entrance;2) that a young man (or some angelic presence) explained what had happened, saying, "He is risen, he is not here";3) that the women were frightened and left the tomb. </div></blockquote>

<p>When we look at John 20:1-2 we find that the fourth Gospel also fits in with this outline. The only difference there is that the angelic interpreter has not been mentioned - but two angels are mentioned in verses 11-13, when Mary is back at the tomb.<br><br>It is quite clear that the Gospel writers were drawing on different sources and different accounts of the Resurrection, but <i>these sources all agree over the empty tomb</i>. Mark's Gospel is generally reckoned to be written in the 60s of the first century AD. But the information he (and the others) drew on was preached, remembered and probably recorded much earlier. As late as AD 56 when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians, we are told that many of the disciples who had seen Jesus after the Resurrection "are still alive" (1 Corinthians 15:6). It is unthinkable that any eyewitnesses would have allowed an empty tomb tradition to develop so uniformly if it was fiction.<br><br>Paul, however, as someone is bound to point out, does not mention the empty tomb. True, but he implies it. In 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 he speaks about the basic core of the Gospel: "that Christ died ... that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day ... and that he appeared [to various disciples]."<br><br>This early "creed" thus focused on the burial as well as the death of Christ. As Professor F.F.Bruce says, "Burial emphasizes the reality of the resurrection which followed, as a divine act which reversed the act of men." It points to the empty tomb. We have to say that what was raised was what was buried - i.e. the body of Jesus. <br><br>Note, also, that Paul specifies that the Resurrection happened on the "third day". What could give rise to this specific date except the discovery of the empty tomb? Had there been no empty tomb but only visionary experiences, there would be no possible reason for such an emphasis on the "third day". <br><br>More importantly, this "basic core'" or "creed" of belief made it clear that Christians believed and must still believe <i>both</i> "that he was raised on the third day" <i>and</i> "that he appeared". The appearances by themselves are not the gospel or good news. Some of the early disciples thought they were just having a psychic experience (Luke 24:37). But together with the empty tomb - a resurrection that reversed the burial - the appearances pointed to the true nature of Jesus' Resurrection: it was a "bodily" resurrection. Certainly, in 1 Corinthians 15.51, Paul presupposes "bodily change": "We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed." He may not explicitly have mentioned the empty tomb - instead he took it for granted, as any Jew would have done in talk of "resurrection". Unlike the Greeks, the Jews did not see a person as a soul entrapped in a body awaiting release at death. Rather, they saw a person more as "body and soul" together. The great hope then was for a resurrection that included the body.<br><br>There are two further questions we must ask over the empty tomb. First, a very simple question: Why did the Jewish authorities never produce the remains of Christ to silence the Christian movement once and for all, if in fact Christ's body was still in the tomb or had been removed? The only explanation which has maintained its credibility over the centuries is that there was no body for them to produce, because of Jesus' bodily Resurrection. <br><br>Secondly, if the Resurrection does <i>not</i> encompass the transformation of the physical body, what do we say in the final analysis about this material universe? What ultimately happens to this universe of space and time? Is it all just some great mistake that God tries to forget? That was the Gnostic heresy - to say "matter is bad or mistaken". <br><br>John Polkinghorne, formerly Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge, then ordained and then President of Queens' College, Cambridge, says, "No! It is not a mistake." And the key is the Empty Tomb. "The Empty Tomb," he writes, "says to me that matter has a destiny, a transformed and transmuted destiny, no doubt, but a destiny nevertheless. The material creation is not a transient, even mistaken episode". That was Paul's view also. He saw Christ's Resurrection as the "first fruits". Ultimately, he said, the creative power of God will transform the whole material universe: "The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God" (Romans 8:21).<br><br>[<i>The above is an extract from my book</i> Church and State in the New Millennium (London, HarperCollins, 2000, pp 201-205) - <i>DRJH</i>]<br><br><br><b>"WHAT HAPPENED AT THE RESURRECTION?" by Tom Wright</b><br><br>In a dark room down an alleyway, four or five men hide in fear. Somehow they have escaped – it was a crowded festival, and the guards couldn't keep track of so many prisoners – and for the last three days they have been holed up. They know how it ended: their leader was dragged through the streets at the end of the triumphal procession, tortured, and executed. They had heard the shouting, full of blood-lust, celebrating the empire's destruction of its (supposedly) dangerous opponent.<br><br>The year is 70 AD; the empire is, of course, Rome; the dead leader is Simon bar Giora, whom the Romans saw as "king of the Jews". I've invented the escaped prisoners to raise the question: what would they think and do next?<br><br>If we were to believe one strand in New Testament scholarship, and quite a bit of popular thought both inside and outside the Church, they might suffer from "cognitive dissonance". They might find it difficult to come to terms with Simon's death. And (as a friend said to me the other day) the idea of resurrection was, in any case, "in the air". Mightn't they have begun to say that he'd been raised from the dead?<br><br>Or perhaps (corresponding to another regular theory about Easter), as they waited and trembled and whispered psalms, they had a new sense of God's presence. They felt loved and forgiven. They felt God somehow with them – or Simon himself with them. Perhaps one of them had a powerful vision of Simon himself, smiling and talking to him. Strange things like that happened in the first century, as they do today. This might have made them say that he'd been raised from the dead.<br><br>No. When we examine what first-century Jews believed about death, life beyond, and resurrection, these theories don't work. Many a Jewish leader was killed by pagans; in no case, except for that of Jesus of Nazareth, did anyone say thereafter either that he was the Messiah or that he'd been raised from the dead. Escape with your life if you can; find another Messiah if you dare; pray and fast and wait for God's fresh comfort and hope – but don't say he's been raised from the dead. He obviously hasn't been.<br><br>"Resurrection" had a clear meaning in the first century: a new bodily life after a period of bodily death. It never referred to "life after death", as it often does in today's misguided Christian usage. Still less was it a word for "His cause continues," or "He's gone to heaven." The word had this meaning for pagans, who, from Homer to Pliny and beyond, routinely denied that it happened (with Platonists insisting, in addition, that it was undesirable).<br><br>Many first-century Jews, nourished on Daniel 12 and martyr-legends, affirmed resurrection; many questioned it, or didn't bother either way. Judaism could also use "resurrection" language as a metaphor, not for a blissful life after death, but for the this-worldly concrete events of return from exile (Ezekiel 37), interpreted in this case as release from foreign domination.<br><br>The Jewish belief was, though, modified in six striking ways:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>1 Resurrection was one point among several on the Jewish spectrum of belief. It was virtually the only option in Christianity.2 Resurrection was important in Judaism, but not that important. It was central and vital in early Christianity.3 Jews saw "the resurrection" as a single event, happening to all at the very end. The Christians declared that it was a two-stage event: Jesus first; others later.4 Judaism never described the resurrection body in detail. The early Christians insisted that it would be a transformed physicality: neither a mere resuscitation to the same kind of life as before (the new body would not suffer or die), nor an abandonment of the body to corruption and decay, while the "real person" (the soul, perhaps) went off elsewhere. That would mean that death was merely reinterpreted not defeated.Paul's language about the "spiritual body" in 1 Corinthians 15 has often been misunderstood. He doesn't mean "a person made of spirit", i.e. "a non-physical person", but "a new body animated by God's Spirit", as in Romans 8.9-11.5 The Jewish metaphorical use of "resurrection" to denote "return from exile" virtually disappears in early Christianity. Instead, we find a different metaphorical use: to refer to baptism and holiness (e.g. Romans 6). "Resurrection" refers to actual persons and events, not simply to states of mind, even when used metaphorically (that is, when actual final resurrection is not in mind). It remains anchored to two central doctrines: God as creator and God as judge. God will put the world to rights, and will rescue creation from corruption, not leave it to rot.6 No one in Judaism ever supposed the Messiah would be resurrected. This was basic to Christianity from the beginning; the resurrection demonstrated Jesus to be Messiah, and therefore the world's true Lord.</div></blockquote>

<p>These developments were mutations from within Jewish belief, not transformations of Jewish ideas into a pagan framework. Together with the other extraordinary events of early Christianity, they force the question why?<br><br>The answer all the early Christians gave, of course, is that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed raised from the dead. They clearly meant by this that, soon after his shameful, violent death, he was bodily alive again.<br><br>"Resurrection" did not mean that he had been "raised to heaven", as people sometimes say. They had other language for that. Nor did it mean, as some have urged, that, over a long period, they had an increasing conviction of Jesus' being "alive among them", guiding them, and so forth, without anything happening to his corpse.<br><br>It may be Spring, but we should resist the call of the cuckoo at this point – not because we are clinging to old-fashioned dogma in the teeth of modern scholarship, but because serious historical investigation about what Jews and Christians said and meant in the first century rules out that interpretation. From the beginning they said, and meant, that Jesus had been raised bodily.<br><br>The stories they told are, of course, fascinatingly confused and elusive? How many women went to the tomb? Did the appearances happen in Galilee (as Mark seems to imply), in Jerusalem (as Luke says), or both (as Matthew says briefly, John more fully)? Piecing together the stories is like figuring out what precisely happened when Karl Popper met Ludwig Wittgenstein on 26 October 1946.<br><br>Some of the greatest minds of the day were present when Wittgenstein brandished a poker and then left the room, but they could never agree afterwards what exactly had occurred (see David Edmonds and John Eidinow, <i>Wittgenstein's Poker: The story of a ten-minute argument between two great philosophers</i>, Faber, 2001). Confused reports of surprising events don't mean that nothing happened.<br><br>The stories themselves are surprising in several ways. One regular theory suggests that they were made up many years later to legitimate or defend an idea of "resurrection" to which the Christians had come, not because of happenings three days after Jesus' death, but because of a combination of new-found faith, spiritual experience, reflection on the scriptures, and church controversy.<br><br>There are several features of the stories themselves, which make this virtually impossible.<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>1 Unlike the rest of the Gospels, not least the crucifixion narratives, the stories are devoid of biblical reference, allusion and echo. They read, not as reflective pieces mulled over with a Bible in hand, but as breathless, pre-reflective accounts. As dramatic anecdotes, they retain for ever (except for very light editing) the form and content they had in their first, and then frequently repeated, tellings.2 The stories all highlight the initial place of the women. By the mid-second century, Celsus was pouring scorn on them for this reason (women were not regarded as credible witnesses in the ancient world). But already by the mid-first century, the "official" account of "the gospel", as in 1 Corinthians 15.4-8, had screened out the women and inserted James the Lord's brother, a central early-Church leader who isn't mentioned in the Gospel resurrection stories.One might imagine one evangelist inventing stories about the women to boost their claims to leadership. We cannot imagine all four doing so, and so differently, unless there really were women who really did find an empty tomb, and whose testimony was discovered to be true.3 The portrait of the risen Jesus is not at all what we would expect. He is "physical"; he can eat, be touched, and leave behind not only an empty tomb, but, at Emmaus, a loaf broken but not consumed. But the same stories speak of his not being recognised, his coming and going through locked doors, and finally his ascending into heaven.Had Luke and John been writing (as many have asserted) to combat the idea that Jesus wasn't really human, they have shot themselves in the feet with both barrels. What the stories do not say is equally remarkable. Had they been invented on the basis of Daniel 12 (the best known Jewish "resurrection" text), they would certainly have had Jesus shining like a star. Their portrait of Jesus is impossible to account for unless it reflects actual memories that surprised the early disciples as they surprise us.4 Almost everywhere else in early Christianity, mention of Jesus' resurrection is closely linked to the Christian's future hope (final resurrection, after a period of being "asleep" or being "with Christ").It is astonishing – and deeply challenging to half our Easter hymns and sermons – that none of the Gospel Easter stories so much as hints at that. The emphasis is on the most basic message of Easter: God's new creation has begun, and Jesus' followers are its agents, not just its beneficiaries. The stories don't say: "Jesus is raised, therefore we will go to heaven and/or be raised from the dead"; they say: "Jesus is raised, therefore we have a job to do.</div></blockquote>

<p>So if the stories are early (albeit written down later), what can the historian say about them? The normal rationalising proposals, as we saw, fail at the level not of dogma but of history. History demands two things: that the tomb really was empty on Easter morning, and that Jesus' followers really did meet him alive again. How do we explain that? Historians often speak of "inference to the best explanation". The best historical explanation for the origin of Christianity is that the stories are basically true.<br><br>The shrill, relentless modernism that opposes this conclusion needs to be confronted head on. It isn't a "modern" discovery that dead people don't rise. Aeschylus and Pliny knew that just as well as Richard Dawkins. Modernist intellectual imperialism tries to do to the Christian gospel what modern geopolitical empires try to do to countries they imagine to be a threat. The resurrection grounds the Christian challenge to both.<br><br>Death is the last weapon of the tyrant: beware of those who want it to remain unchallenged. Jesus' resurrection, precisely because it is the start of God's new creation, is the foundation, not for an escapist, other-worldly theology, nor one wedded to outmoded dogma, but for one that generates and sustains the lasting work of God's kingdom within real human history. Resurrection is the ground of Christian hope for life before death, as well as beyond it.<br><br>[<i>The above is an article by Tom Wright in the </i>Church Times, <i>Easter 2003</i>.]<br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Wilberforce, Slavery, Sexual Morality and R.P.George">(May 2007) Wilberforce, Slavery, Sexual Morality and R.P.George</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2007</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Wilberforce and A Practical View</b><br><br>200 years ago saw the fruits of Wilberforce's campaign to end the evil British slave trade, for which we thank God. The film Amazing Grace plus a number of Radio and TV programmes have brought William Wilberforce to the attention of a public audience in a remarkable way. <br><br>However, what has not been so well reported is the fact that in his day Wilberforce was not only known for being anti-slavery but also for being the author of A Practical View. The full title of the book is "A practical view of the prevailing religious system of professed Christians in the higher and middle classes in this country contrasted with real Christianity." The publisher thought no one would want the book in the decadent Britain of the late 18th century. A mere 500 copies were printed. These went immediately; so 75,000 more copies were run off. By 1837 there had been fifteen editions, each with thousands of books. In America there had been 25 editions and the book was translated into German, Italian, Spanish and Dutch. Wilberforce knew there was a connection with "real Christianity" and the social order. He said that real Christianity was powerfully adapted "to promote the preservation and health of political communities." This related to his own personal calling. From his own conversion at the age of 25 he confessed that "God Almighty has put before me two great objects – the abolition of the slave trade and the reformation of the manners [or lifestyle and morality] of England."<br><br>For Wilberforce lifestyle and morality most certainly included sexual morality. Wilberforce would be horrified, therefore, at the way his campaign to secure freedom for slaves is being used to champion campaigns to abolish fundamental restraints on sexual immorality, not least homosexual immorality. Wilberforce bewailed the fact that in his day people's "standard of right and wrong is not the standard of the Gospel; they approve and condemn by a different rule; they advance principles, and maintain opinions, altogether opposite to the genius and character of Christianity." And what was the problem? Wilberforce answered: "The truth is, their opinions on the subject of religion are not formed from the perusal of the Word of God." Because people were so ignorant of biblical Christianity, when attacks were made against it, they had no defence. He said: <br>"Knowing Christianity chiefly in the difficulties which it contains, and in the impossibilities which are falsely imputed to it, they fall, perhaps, into the company of infidels; there they are shaken by frivolous objections and profane cavils, which, had their religious persuasion been grounded in reason and argument, would have passed them by as the idle wind."<br><br><b>Robert P. George</b><br><br>Robert P.George, a distinguished Professor of Law at Princeton University in the United States, wrote a short piece related to all this for the April 2007 edition of Touchstone: A magazine of Mere Christianity (www.touchstonemag.com). It is reprinted here with the permission of the editor, David Mills. The title in the magazine is "Emancipation Bible" - with a subtitle being "on the Pro-Choice arguments for Slavery and Sodomy." Professor George writes as follows:-<br></p>

<blockquote><div>In a posting on a law professor’s weblog, a scholar who argues for the revision of Catholic teaching to accept homosexual conduct in 'loving, committed relationships' claimed to be struck by similarities in the use of Scripture between the contemporary debate over homosexuality and the nineteenth-century debate over slavery. What he, and others who offer the same argument, have in mind, it seems, is that both Christian defenders of slavery in the nineteenth century and Christian critics of sodomy today use biblical passages in a literalist manner as 'proof texts' for their views, and that the arguments of the second will someday be seen to have been as indefensible as those of the first. To my mind, however, it is the differences between the nineteenth-century debate over slavery and our debate that are more striking.Christians who wished to practice or justify slavery in the antebellum American south immediately faced a problem. Sacred Scripture, in its opening passages, teaches that each and every human being is made in the image and likeness of God. All human beings are descended from the same original parents and, as such, are in the most fundamental sense brothers and sisters. Opponents of slavery pressed the point, and pro-slavery Christians had difficulty meeting their argument directly. But an indirect defence was available. The Bible at various points refers to slavery, and even proposes norms pertaining to its practice while not condemning it as unjust or in any way immoral. So, pro-slavery Christians asserted, those in a position to practice slavery are entitled to choose whether or not to practice it. No one may be forced against his conscience to own slaves, but anyone who chooses to own a slave does not necessarily contravene Christian moral principles by doing so.Unsound resourcesIn other words Christians, who were 'pro-choice' on the slavery question (as we might put it), pointed to the absence of a biblical condemnation and to suggestions of the Bible’s tacit approval in order to justify a position very difficult to square with the logical implications of biblical anthropology. (Of course, the fact that the slavery they were defending was a racially based form of chattel slavery made justifying their position even on biblical grounds especially difficult, but lay that aside for now.)These pro-slavery Christians were wrong. And the practice they were defending was horribly wicked. But it must be conceded that they had available to them scriptural resources for an argument, albeit an unsound and, it is now clear, deeply scandalous one. But these same resources (ever unsound as they were) are not available to those who wish to defend the compatibility of the choice to engage in fornication, adultery, or sodomy with Christian anthropology and moral principles. Unlike slavery, these and other forms of sexual immorality are the subjects of scriptural condemnation, as clear and extensive in the New Testament as in the Old. Moreover, the idea that they may legitimately be chosen has been rejected by the firm and constant teaching of the Church, East and West. This teaching, by its centring on what is involved in and required by the very concept of 'the marital' (both for married and unmarried persons), was and is scripturally grounded in a way that goes far beyond mere 'proof texting.'Thus, Christians, who today seek to justify deviations from traditional norms of sexual morality, can do no more than attempt to explain away the scriptural condemnations of the conduct they defend. So, for example, some of them attempt to show that the explicit condemnation of homosexual conduct is merely a matter of ritual purity and practice, not the expression of a moral teaching. They cannot say about the morally controversial practices they wish to defend what the pro-slavery Christians could and did say about the morally controversial practice they defended. They cannot claim that the Bible treats it as a normal and accepted social practice and offers no condemnation of it.These are two differences. There are also similarities. Most notably, like Christian defenders of slavery, Christian defenders of sexual practices condemned by historic Christian teaching seek to show that Christianity is more permissive than their opponents say it is. And, correspondingly, of course, Christian opponents of sodomy, like Christian opponents of slavery, see the Christian ethic as more rigorous by virtue of its excluding certain controversial forms of conduct from the universe of morally available options for choice, despite the fact that some intelligent, well-informed people do not share the conviction that the conduct is wrong.Unavailable ScriptureThe fact that those who argued for a more permissive view of morality in the case of slavery were wrong does not mean that those who today argue for a more permissive view of the morality of sodomy or other controversial forms of sexual conduct cannot be right. Whether they are right or wrong will have to be judged on the quality of the arguments they advance. (For what it is worth, it seems to me that their arguments fail badly.) My point in these comments has been only that they do not have available to them the scriptural resources that were available to, and were exploited by, those who argued that slaveholding was compatible with Christian morality. That, I think, is a striking difference." So writes Robert George.</div></blockquote>

                <p>When was the last time you thought about heaven? When was the last time that the thought of heaven settled a decision in your life (eg, about your use of money or time)? When was the last time that the thought of heaven counterbalanced your sorrows and made you joyful when otherwise you wouldn’t have been? When was the last time you actually wished you were already there?<br><br>I’ve been asked to speak on heaven. And preparing this certainly convicted me that my own thoughts of heaven are too few and far between, too small and don’t shape my daily life to anything like the extent that you see modelled in the New Testament (NT). So I decided I needed something to shake me up. And if you want shaking up in your Christain life, the place to go is to the writings of the Puritans. In this case, I reached for a book by Richard Baxter called The Saints’ Everlasting Rest - and I hope that something of its impact will come through today. I want to start by quoting what he says after several chapters describing heaven:<br><br>If there be so certain and glorious a rest for the saints, why is there no more earnest seeking after it? One would think, if a man did but once hear of such unspeakable glory to be obtained, and believed what he heard, he would be transported with the vehemency of his desire after it, and would almost forget to eat and drink, and would care for nothing else, and speak of and inquire after nothing else... And yet people who hear of [this treasure] daily, and profess to believe it as a fundamental article of their faith, as little mind it, or labour [towards] it, as if they had never heard of any such thing, or did not believe one word they hear.<br><br>And even the godly themselves are too lazy seekers of their everlasting rest. Alas! what a disproportion there is between our light and heat, our profession and prosecution! Who makes such haste as if it were for heaven? How still we stand! how idly we work! how we talk, and jest, and trifle away our time!... Where is the man that is in earnest a Christian? Methinks men every where make but a trifle of their eternal state. They look after it but a little by the by; they do not make it the business of their lives. [And he adds that he himself is ‘sick... of the same disease’.]<br><br>So let’s turn to 1 Peter 1 and before we go on, let us pray:<br><br><i>Father in heaven,<br>We confess that what Richard Baxter writes is true of us as well. We confess that heaven is not often in our thoughts and that our lives fall short of  being clearly shaped by the hope of it. Father, forgive us that our spiritual vision is so easily clouded by the visible and the immediate. And as Paul prayed for the Ephesians, we ask that you would enlighten the eyes of our hearts so that we may know the hope to which you have called us. Please work in us so that we believe in heaven more firmly, and set ourselves to keep our eyes on it more consistently beyond today.<br>In Jesus’ name. Amen</i><br><br>1 Peter 1 is about heaven. And this talk is going to be less like a photograph with all the detail the camera sees, and more like an impressionist painting where detail is sacrificed to the main thing. And the first main thing Peter says is this:<br><br><b>1. THINK OF YOURSELF AS ON A JOURNEY TO HEAVEN (vv1-5)</b><br><br>Verse 1:</p>

<blockquote><div>1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 2 who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. 3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade - kept in heaven for you, 5 who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. (vv1-5)</div></blockquote>

<p>So notice that we are to think of ourselves, v1, as: ‘strangers in the world’. The original word literally means ‘people who are temporary residents’, just passing through. So, eg, I taught in Kenya for a year and soon after I arrived I had to go to the local police to register. And they issued me with something like a passport and it said on it, ‘This is to certify that Ian Garrett is a temporarily resident alien.’ And I was an alien there. I didn’t belong there, and I knew I was ultimately heading home. So even though I was there for a whole year, my mindset was, ‘I’m just passing through.’ And the thought of home coloured everything - so, eg, I didn’t find the fairly primitive conditions in the village that hard to bear, because I knew it was only temporary. Eg, I knew I’d soon be back in the land of clean drinking water actually coming out of taps in your house; and of flushing loos; and of tarmac roads. Infrastructure heaven awaited me back home. And Peter’s saying we must think of ourselves like that throughout this life - because we’re temporary residents, just passing through. As the old gospel song puts it:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>This world is not my home; I am just passing through.My treasures are laid up away beyond the blue.The angels beckon to me from heaven’s open doorAnd I cannot feel at home here in this world anymore.</div></blockquote>

<p><br>So skip with me like a good impressionist painter to v3:</p>

<blockquote><div>3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade - kept in heaven for you... (vv3-4)</div></blockquote>

<p>So how do I know that there is a heaven and that I am going there? Peter’s answer is: ‘through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead’. Now I don’t have time to go over the evidence for the resurrection and the logic of how Jesus’ resurrection guarantees ours’. [See www.church.org.uk sermons on John 20.24-31 (18/4/04), 1 Corinthians 15.1-28 (2/9/03), 1 Corinthians 15.35-58 (22/6/03); read Jesus on Trial, Kel Richards, Matthias Media – from www.thegoodbook.co.uk.] If you feel you lack confidence on that and need to go over it, then you’re right: you do. Because everything Peter says here is anchored in the historical fact of Jesus’ resurrection. He saw the empty tomb; he saw the bodily resurrected Jesus; everything he says here hangs on those facts. And Peter would say: we know there is a heaven beyond death because he and the other apostles saw Jesus alive beyond death. And he would say we know we are going there because if we’re connected to Jesus by faith, then his resurrection guarantees ours.<br><br>One way of illustrating that is to think of a dam being broken. I once saw some footage of a huge dam across a river being blown up – I think it was a hydro-electric scheme that had been a total failure. And to bring it down, they just set off this tiny explosion in the middle of the face of the dam wall. I’d expected this huge blast, but it was little more than a puff. And a drop and then a tiny stream of water started coming through; then it began cracking everything around it; then huge chunks started falling away; and finally the entire thing gave way and this vast mass of water came through. And all that began with a first drop of water that pulled after it every other drop that was connected to it. And it’s like that with the resurrection. Paul calls Jesus ‘the firstborn’ from the dead (Romans 8.29, Colossians 1.18) and the ‘firstfruits of those who have died’ (1 Corinthians 15.20) – ie, the first of many to rise from the dead. And if, by faith, we’re forgiven and connected to him, he will ‘pull us through’ death after him.<br><br>So what will it be like? Well, George Bernard Shaw (a fairly cynical unbeliever) wrote this:<br><br>Heaven is always [thought of] as a perpetual holiday... [and] as conventionally conceived, is a place so inane, so dull, so useless, so miserable, that nobody has ever ventured to describe a whole day [there], though plenty of people have described a day at the seaside; [and he goes on to say with approval:]... the genuine popular verdict on it is expressed in the proverb, "Heaven for holiness and Hell for company."<br><br>Ie, ‘It’s not a great place to be.’ Well maybe the Bible doesn’t describe a whole day there, but if Shaw had at least read the last two chapters of Revelation he’d have got a glimpse of it. Richard Baxter in The Saints’ Everlasting Rest writes a chapter trying to describe it, and then tried to imagine a believer’s reaction to it. He writes:<br><br>From [heaven] the saint can look behind him and before him. And to compare past with present things must raise in [his] soul an inconceivable esteem and sense of its condition... To stand in heaven and look back on earth, and weigh them together in the balance... how must it transport the soul, and make it cry out, <br>“Is this the purchase that cost so dear as the blood of Christ? No wonder... Is this the end of believing? Is this the end of the Spirit’s workings? Have the gales of grace blown me into such a harbour? ... O blessed way, and blessed end! Is this the glory which the Scriptures spoke of, and ministers preached of so much? I see [now] the Gospel is indeed good tidings... Is my mourning, my fasting, my sad humblings, my heavy walking, come to this? Is my praying, watching, fearing to offend, come to this? Are all my afflictions, Satan’s temptations, the world’s jeers, come to this? O [my] vile nature, that resisted so much, and so long, such a blessing! Unworthy soul! is this the place you came to so unwillingly? Was duty wearisome? Was the world too good to lose? Could you not leave all, deny all, and suffer anything for this? Were you loathe to die, to come to this? O false heart, you almost betrayed me to eternal flames, and lost me this glory! Are you not now ashamed, my soul, that you ever questioned that love which brought you here... and misinterpreted those providences, and [resented] those ways which have [led to] such an end? Now you are convinced that your blessed Redeemer was saving you as well when he crossed your desires, as when he granted them; when he broke your heart, as when he bound it up. No thanks to you, unworthy self, for this received crown; but to [the Lord] and the Lamb be glory for ever.”<br><br>So why does Baxter imagine it’s that good? Well, because of what Peter says in v4: that it’s ‘an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade’ – literally in the original, ‘that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading [as the ESV translation says].’<br><br>So let’s ponder our way through those. Imperishable. Ie, as Revelation 21 says, there will be no more death - ie, no more mortality. Because death isn’t just a final event, it’s the condition we’re born under and that’s eating away at us from the word go. And I think I’ve been more acutely aware of it this year than ever, as it’s cast its shadow on friends and family of all ages – from the unborn to the elderly. I’m now seeing my parents and senior brothers and sisters in our church declining more visibly and quickly than ever; and it reminds me that once they’ve gone, I’m next, generationally. Calvin once said, ‘We live in an envelope of death.’ And Peter says: in heaven, we’ll be out of it forever.<br><br>Imperishable. Then, undefiled – ie, unspoiled by sin. I trust that you identify with the apostle Paul in Romans 7 when he writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do... 21 So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God's law; 23 but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? [ie, who will get me out of this situation of now wanting to please God as a born-again man, and yet still being in a fallen body, full of sinful desires to which I all too readily succumb? Who will get me out of the endless and ashaming cycle of praying, ‘Your will be done,’ and then having to come back with my tail between my legs, praying, ‘Forgive us our sins’? And he goes on:] 25 Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Romans 7.15-25)</div></blockquote>

<p><br>Ie, it’ll happen through Jesus Christ our Lord. And then he writes Romans 8 about how we’ll be raised from the dead through being connected to Jesus – the first drop pulling through the rest. So heaven will be a place where we’ll experience no more sinful desires within. And where there will be no more sinful people creating a sinful environment to act on us from without. Eg, no more pornography and no more desire or thin-end-of-the-wedge curiosity to look at it. No more hostility to Christ without and no more cowardice concerning him within. And so on.<br><br>Imperishable, undefiled, and then, unfading. Ie, the satisfaction will never end. You may know of the writer Julian Barnes. He wrote a book called The History of the World in 10 ½ Chapters. The last chapter is called The Dream, where the guy narrating the book dreams that he’s died and woken up in heaven. And he discovers it’s a place where you can do anything you want – so, eg, he meets all the famous people he’s ever wanted to, he has amazing gourmet meals, he plays on replicas of all the famous golf courses and, predictably, has plenty of sex. But the problem hits him when he finally goes round the golf course in 18 holes-in-one. And he asks his chaperoning angel what he should do now. ‘It’s as if golf is used up,’ he says. So she suggests other sports and he says, ‘But they’d get used up, too.’ So she suggests trying to go round the 18 holes twice, and do 36 holes-in-one. But he tells her that wouldn’t work – and he slowly realises that the ‘heaven’ he’s in won’t really satisfy. And when he says so one day to his chaperoning angel, she says,<br><br>‘Well, everyone has the option to die off if they want to.’<br>‘I never knew that,’ he said... What percentage of people take the option...?’<br>She looked at me levelly, her glance telling me to be calm. ‘Oh, a hundred percent, of course... everyone takes the option sooner or later.’<br><br>It’s a brilliant description of a heaven without God - and the way it wouldn’t satisfy. And although we’re in danger of trotting this out like a formula, it is the truth that only relationship with God can satisfy us - and only that relationship perfected in heaven will satisfy us perfectly. I think one of the modern writers and speakers who’s most helpful on that is John Piper, whose ministry motto is ‘God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.’ And if you feel challenged over whether you’re really seeking your ultimate satisfaction in God, I recommend his material [eg, the books Desiring God and Future Grace; transcripts and mp3 downloads of his talks available from www.desiringgod.org ].<br><br>So that’s the first thing: Think of yourself as on a journey to heaven. ‘This world is not my home; I am just passing through.’<br><br><b>2. REJOICE IN HEAVEN IN YOUR SUFFERING (vv6-9)</b><br><br>Verse 6:</p>

<blockquote><div>6 In this [ie, the thought of heaven] you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 7 These have come so that your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire - may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 8 Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 9 for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. (vv6-9)</div></blockquote>

<p>A friend in a fairly difficult work situation has some time off coming up and he said to me the other day, ‘The office isn’t great, but to be honest I’m just living for the holiday right now.’ And I guess we can relate to that: work isn’t great but the thought of the holiday keeps our spirits up; exams aren’t great but the thought of the summer beyond keeps our spirits up; having an operation isn’t great, but the thought of the health improvement down the tracks keeps our spirits up. We do it all the time – living in the future to keep our spirits up in the present.<br><br>And Peter is saying: live in the future of heaven to keep your joy up in the present. Think of it; think of yourself as there in principle - and very nearly there in practice; and let that thought ‘suck back’, as it were, into the present. And let it counterbalance whatever you’re going through in the present – like Paul writes in Romans 8:</p>

<blockquote><div>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. (Romans 8.18)</div></blockquote>

<p>Now there are times in our lives when I think we want to say to Paul, ‘Well, that’s because you don’t understand what I’m going through right now.’ To which Paul would gently reply, ‘No, it’s because you haven’t yet grasped what heaven will be like - put the present and heaven on opposite sides of the scales, and the weight of heaven far outweighs the weight of suffering on the way.’<br><br>So, eg, we do suffer perishability here and now. We suffer aging and disability and miscarriages and cancer and infertility and pain and all the indignities and losses of actually dying (unless the Lord returns first). But we will one day have resurrection bodies that are beyond all those things - where we won’t be tempted to look at someone else’s health with envy, or mourn the loss of what we once had. It’ll be imperishable.<br><br>Again, we do suffer defilement here and now. We live in bodies with sinful desires that we can’t eradicate, and where certain sins have a powerful lever of habit on us from the past. And you sometimes think wistfully to yourself, ‘I’m never going to change. Maybe the lazy or proud or bitter me (or whatever’s your area of particular struggle) is in fact the real me’ It’s like the story of the two caterpillars munching on a leaf and suddenly this stunningly beautiful butterfly lands beside them, sits awhile and then takes off again. And one caterpillar turns to the other and says wistfully, ‘I wish I could go up in one of those things some day.’ And of course he will, thanks to the wonders of metamorphosis. And we will ‘fly’, spiritually, one day thanks to the wonders of resurrection into a body free of sinful desires and a place free of stimulation to sin. And the frustrations of repeated failure will finally be behind us. It’ll be undefiled.<br><br>And we do suffer dissatisfaction – or ‘fading’, to use Peter’s word – here and now. Eg, we suffer it in lack of relationships, or in relationships that aren’t what we wished - or in the loss of them. We suffer it in hopes that never came to be – jobs we never got, children we never had, achievements we never pulled off, whatever. But heaven will satisfy. Eg, the Lord Jesus said that, ‘When the dead rise they will neither marry nor be given in marriage’ (Mark 12.34) – such will be the quality of all relationships, supremely with God. So those who’ve been single and wished for more will be fully satisfied. And so will those who’ve been married and wished for more because they’ve learned that even the best marriages are frustrated by sin and fall short of full satisfaction. It’ll be unfading.<br><br>That’s how we need to think of heaven, to keep our joy up in the trials of the present. And trials will come, because God sends them with a purpose, according to v7:</p>

<blockquote><div>7 These have come so that your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire - may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed [ie, in the day he comes again]. (v7)</div></blockquote>

<p>So whatever we’re finding trying right now, God is allowing to test and refine our faith. Because the worst case scenario is that I profess faith in Christ, but for that faith to be not genuine – the kind of faith by which I can fool myself and you; but not the Lord Jesus. Remember how he once said:</p>

<blockquote><div>21"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' [ie, who professes faith] will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven [ie, who shows his faith genuine by trying - albeit imperfectly - to obey God] 22 Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' 23 Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' (Matthew 7.21-23)</div></blockquote>

<p>And to keep me from that worst case scenario, he tests my faith - which makes me ask, ‘Is it worth being a Christian? Shall I carry on?’ And I guess many of us will know people who’ve dropped back from a profession of faith because of some awful thing that’s hit them in life. And it’s hard to know how to react when they say, ‘I just didn’t think a loving God would allow this to happen to us.’ But in those situations, the test to faith is this: will I keep trusting in God’s goodness even when I can’t read it off my circumstances right now, as I’ll be able to in heaven? And will I keep trying to obey God without making my obedience conditional on getting the circumstance I want in return (‘God, I’ll obey you if you...’)? And as faith passes through those tests, it comes out more refined: the self-centredness and self-interest that sees God as mainly there to serve my wishes is burned away. And faith is made more God-centred - which is the whole point: as the Westminster Coinfession puts it, ‘The chief end of man is to know God and glorify him forever.’ (That’s where John Piper gets that motto of his, ‘God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.’) So, eg, when Job’s trials made it look as if God wasn’t good or worth trusting, he said magnificently ‘Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him’ (Job 13.15). And that’s the kind of profoundly God-centred faith that will bring us unfooled to heaven and, end of v7, that results in praise, glory and honour to Jesus.<br><br>So that’s the second thing: rejoice in heaven in suffering. Let the thought of it counterbalance the trials of the present, and make you see that those trials are to wean you off seeking your ultimate good anywhere else than in God.<br><br><b>3. KEEP HEAVEN IN MIND AS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL ALL THE TIME (vv13-21)</b><br><br>Again, as impressionists rather than photographers let’s skip to v13:</p>

<blockquote><div>13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. (v13)</div></blockquote>

<p>The King James Version translates that literally and it goes, ‘Gird up the loins of your mind; be sober.’ The first bit of that is taken from Exodus 12, on Passover night, when God was about to take his people out of Egypt on the journey to the promised land. And he told them to eat that last Passover meal in Egypt with their ‘loins girded’ – ie, their cloaks tucked up into their belts so they could actually move. And the other bit, ‘be sober’, we’re more familiar with. It just means seeing straight where you’re going and therefore being able to walk straight. So Peter is saying: you are on a journey, you are heading to a ‘promised land’, heaven. So mentally, get yourself and keep yourself in a frame of mind that’s consciously moving towards that goal, and don’t let anything distract you from that goal, and don’t let any lesser goals become ultimate goals:</p>

<blockquote><div>13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. (v13)</div></blockquote>

<p>The question is: how? How can we regularly, daily, tell ourselves we are going to heaven, so that we shape our lives accordingly?<br><br>Well, somewhere along the line a speaker is almost bound to include the application, ‘Have a Quiet Time’ – ie, a daily time of Bible reading and prayer. But I make no apology for doing that because I don’t know what else to say first. Not every passage of the Bible is on heaven. But as I’ve read the Bible over the past 25 years of my Christian life, it’s become clear to me that the whole Bible is basically one long promise about our future there. And even if the passage I’m reading isn’t explicitly about heaven, one way or another it’ll shape me to be moving in that direction. And what goes for Quiet Times also goes for things like Home Groups or other Bible study groups - which we men are generally not so good at as the women because we’re generally more self-sufficient (ie, proud) and less groupy.<br><br>How else can we keep heaven in mind as our ultimate goal all the time? Maybe stick something on the bathroom mirror saying, ‘Remember: you’re going to heaven.’ Or if you keep some kind of spiritual journal or notebook, then like the Puritan Jonathan Edwards you might write some resolutions and regularly (eg, monthly, as he did) measure yourself by them. Eg,. Here are some of his 70 resolutions:<br><br>No. 5 Resolved, never to lose one moment of time, but to improve it in the most profitable way I can.<br>No.7 Resolved, never to do anything I would be afraid to do if it were the last hour of my life.<br>No.17 Resolved, that I will so live as I shall wish I had done when I come to die.<br>No.22 Resolved, to obtain for myself as much happiness in the next life as I possibly can.<br>No.50 Resolved, that I will act so as I think I shall judge would have been best and most prudent when I come into the future world.<br>No.55 Resolved, to endeavour to my utmost so to act as I can think I should do if I had already seen the happiness of heaven and the torments of hell.<br><br>What else? Richard Baxter in The Saints’ Everlasting Rest says: talk to one another about heaven. Eg, sit down with a Christian friend or prayer-partner and say, ‘Let’s talk about heaven and what difference it should be making to our lives right now.’ Baxter says: make the most of corporate praise when we gather as a church. I know for some of us men, singing isn’t our thing - or at least our strength - but Baxter’s point is that praise should be as a foretaste of part of the experience of heaven, where God will finally fill our affections as he should. Baxter says: turn every earthly pleasure into a moment to remember heaven. Next time your heart lifts at an amazing view, or seeing your children happy, or whatever it is, tell yourself, ‘Heaven will be far better than this.’ And Baxter says: turn every earthly sorrow into a moment to remember heaven. Whatever it is, tell yourself, ‘This will never happen in heaven.’<br><br>I guess you could say those are all ‘disciplines’ or ‘methods’ for keeping heaven in mind as our ultimate goal. But it’s basically a mindset, that has Bible-convictions about heaven which then ‘suck back’ into the present. So let’s just ponder together: what in this life will ultimately last? And in the light of heaven - and hell - what in this life has ultimate significance? Well, all that ultimately lasts is people - not things. Job also said, ‘Naked I came from my mother’s womb and naked I shall depart’ (Job 2.21). And therefore what has ultimate significance is quite simply how we treat people. You remember in 1 Corinthians 13, Paul talks about how all sorts of things will pass away at the Lord Jesus’ return - eg, the use of gifts like preaching which just won’t be necessary when we know the Lord face to face. And Paul concludes, ‘And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love’ (1 Corinthians 13.13).<br><br>So what is of ultimate significance is how we love people (and use things to do so). And in the light of heaven and hell, the highest form of love for my neighbour is to try to tell him or her the gospel. So, the love of seriously committed evangelism has to be part of this mindset. Then, there’s the love of seriously committed fellowship. Hebrews (10.24-25) tells us we’re to ‘encourage one another’ and ‘spur one another on’ – ‘and all the more as you see the Day [ie, the day of the Lord Jeus’ return] approaching’. Ie, once you’re on the Christian journey to heaven as my brother or sister, I’m to help you get there –and vice versa. So I’m not to decide my commitment to church or to a group on the question ‘What am I getting out of it?’, but on the question, ‘What am I doing to help my brothers and sisters get to heaven?’ Church can just seem to be about lukewarm instant coffee on a Sunday and endless bits of paper at Home Group. But we need to see that it’s really about helping one another to heaven. And then there’s the love not just of fellow-believers, but of everyone. And I wonder what Puritans like Baxter would think of us in that regard. I point the finger at myself first. But I wonder whether they’d think our use of at least some of our discretionary time was sometimes pretty self-indulgent. Eg, when they saw us going off to see another film, whether they’d wonder why we weren’t visiting the elderly or the sick. Or when they saw us going out for another meal, whether they’d wonder why we weren’t down helping out at the Peoples’ Kitchen (or whatever).<br><br>What’s of ultimate significance is people, not things. So, can I remind us that what we do in houses is what ultimately counts, not what we do to them. The fruits of our hospitality and bringing up children in the training of the Lord and all sorts of other ministry will survive the Lord’s return. Our DIY won’t. (Mine won’t even last until the Lord’s return.) Can I remind us that what we do with our money is more important than whether we make it or have it or save it or invest it. What’s it doing – apart from meeting our needs – that will ultimately count? And can I remind us that our children’s spiritual welfare is more important than any other part of their welfare, like their education. Eg, in the light of eternity, it will look far wiser to have moved to an area or stayed in an area to guarantee them a better church, than to guarantee them a better school.<br><br>Now Baxter talks about ‘duties’ and ‘necessities’ - like doing our jobs, providing for families, maintaining the house and car and so on. And his message is: don’t resent them – as if a truly heavenly-minded life would somehow cut those things out (as if heaven itself will be work-free or responsibility-free! – remember, the man who earned ten more minas in the parable got put in charge of ten cities at the Lord’s return). But his message is: don’t be engrossed in them either (see 1 Cornithians 7.29-31, 1 John 2.15-17). Eg, as you look after the car, think of it as a future cube of scrap metal, which will be further melted down when the Lord returns. Keep it all in eternal perspective. I also read for this John Calvin’s chapter on ‘Meditating on the Future Life’ and he helpfully adds to ‘duties’ and ‘necessities’ ‘delights’. He says the danger of all this is that we go to the extreme of thinking that God doesn’t mean us to enjoy things here and now, or rest here and now. But that is not the message. The message is: keep your necessities and duties and delights in the perspective of eternity.<br><br>I’ve mentioned John Piper. He edited a book called Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, in which he writes a series of challenges first to men then to women on developing this kind of mindset. Let me read some of the ones to men to you (and to myself). He writes:<br><br>My earnest challenge and prayer for you is...<br>[No.7] That you be totally committed to ministry, whatever your specific calling; that you not fritter away your time on excessive sports and recreation or unimportant hobbies or aimless diddling in the garage; but that you redeem the time for Christ and his kingdom.<br>[No.11] That you not assume advancement and peer approval in your gainful employment are the highest values in life; but that you ponder the eternal significance of faithful fatherhood and time spent with your wife; that you repeatedly consider the new possibilities at each stage of your life for maximising your energies for the glory of God in ministry; that you pose the question often: Is our family moulded by the culture, or do we embody the values of the kingdom of God? That you lead the family in making choices not on the basis of secular trends or upward lifestyle expectations, but on the basis of what will strengthen the faith of the family and advance the cause of Christ.<br>[No.13] That you develop a wartime mentality and lifestyle; that you never forget that life is short, that billions of people hang in the balance of heaven and hell every day, that the love of money is spiritual suicide, that the goals of upward mobility (nicer clothes, cars, houses, vacations, food, hobbies) are poor and dangerous substitutes for the the goals of living for Christ with all your might and maximising your joy in ministry to peoples’ needs.<br><br>But at the end of our Bible passage, Peter himself spells out more of what this mindset will look like. Look at v14:</p>

<blockquote><div>14 As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. 15 But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 16 for it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy [quoting Leviticus 11.44-45]." (vv14-16)</div></blockquote>

<p>Remember, the picture we’re to have in our minds is the journey out of Egypt and to the promised land. (For us, that’s a prefiguring of the journey we’re on, out of this world and to heaven.) And at the start of that journey, God told his Old Testament (OT) people to ‘be holy [ie, ‘be other’] - because he is holy [ie, other] and because they really belonged to, and were going to, another place. And that’s the message for us. We belong to a God who is completely other than this sinful world and who is taking us to be with him in a place that is completely other. So it’s a powerful question to ask, ‘Would I do this in heaven?’ Would I watch this? listen to this? laugh at this? say this? spend time or money on this? And as I once heard a speaker say, this calls for ‘cultural amputation’ for us – ie, there are areas of our culture we just can’t take part in: films we shouldn’t see, books and magazines (not just the obvious out-of-bounds ones) we shouldn’t read, programs we should switch off. There are many areas where we need to be other-worldy, living as if we’re in heaven – areas like truth-telling, being uncomplaining, avoiding malice and gossip, and areas of sexual conduct and conduct with alcohol. We’re not just to be slightly different but completely other.<br><br>And lastly look to v17:</p>

<blockquote><div>17 Since you call on a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear. 18 For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. (vv17-19)</div></blockquote>

<p>Peter’s reminding us that although we’ll pass safely through the day of judgement if we have genuine, saving faith in Jesus, we’ll still be judged in the sense of evaluated. We’ll see with ‘20/20 hindsight’ what our lives and our priorities and our service really looked like to our Father in heaven, what our lives really look like in the light of eternity. And that’s why Jonathan Edwards wrote those resolutions, so that the epitaph written over him would not be, as I’ve heard it put, ‘Saved soul, wasted life.’<br><br>So what does 1 Peter 1 say about heaven? It says: 1) Think of yourself as on a journey to heaven (vv1-5), 2) Rejoice in heaven in your suffering (vv6-9), and 3) Keep heaven in mind as your ultimate goal all the time (vv13-21).<br><br>Let Richard Baxter, in The Saints’ Everlasting Rest, have the last word:</p>

<blockquote><div>I require you, reader, as ever you hope for a part in this glory, that you presently take your heart to task, chide it for its wilful strangeness to God, turn your thoughts from the pursuit of vanity, bend your soul to study eternity, busy it about the life to come, habituate yourself to such contemplations, and let not those thoughts be seldom and cursory, but bathe your soul in heaven’s delights; and if your backward soul begin to flag and your thoughts to scatter, call them back, hold them to their work, bear not with their laziness, nor connive at one neglect. And when you have, in obedience to God, tried this work, got acquainted with it, and kept a guard on your thoughts till they are accustomed to obey, you will then find yourself in the suburbs of heaven, and that there is indeed a sweetness in the work and way of God, and that the life of Christianity is a life of joy. You will wilt meet with those abundant consolations which you have prayed, panted, and groaned after, and which so few Christians do ever here obtain, because they know not this way to them, or else make not conscience of walking in it.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. (v13)</div></blockquote>

                <p><i>There is nothing new about JPC having a vision for church growth locally and worldwide and for the planting of new churches. A century before the development of  Holy Trinity Gateshead, JPC launched Holy Trinity Jesmond. This is an abridgement that I have made, with permission, of part of chapter 4 of Alan Munden’s book ‘A Light in a Dark Place: Jesmond Parish Church, Newcastle upon Tyne’ (which is available from the JPC bookstall at £12.50). This section of the book describes the period 1898 – 1907, when Thomas Brocas Waters was the fifth vicar of Jesmond. <br><br>Jonathan Pryke</i><br><br><br><b>A vision for soul-winning</b><br><br>Thomas Brocas Waters was born in Bowden, Cheshire in October 1862. He was educated at Tonbridge School and Trinity College, Cambridge. On his appointment as vicar of Jesmond he was a bachelor and lived with his sister Edith in rented accommodation at 4 Granville Road, and then at the vicarage at 14 Victoria Square. In June 1902 he married Alice Young, a member of the congregation and daughter of James Young a consulting engineer, and they subsequently had a family of two sons. <br><br>During Brocas Waters’ incumbency he was responsible for the opening of two daughter churches, the promotion of Christian Holiness, the introduction of the Prayer League, and the active encouragement of Christian witness and practical service. It was his conviction that ‘more and more do I feel that true life centres and pivots itself on the atonement and the resurrection, and that all the realities of our existence seem directly or indirectly to be united to these great facts.’ He was deeply influenced by the Holiness movement, and from 1902 a party of over twenty people from Jesmond attended the Keswick Convention, but for Brocas Waters, Holiness was no dead-end spirituality. ‘I plead that we shall no longer play at evangelisation, but make it the serious business of our lives, and have a definite plan of campaign.’ <br><br>Brocas Waters wanted laymen and laywomen to be active in their witness and service and not to be indifferent to the needs of those around them. He wanted wholehearted Christian commitment so that individuals would be prepared for service at home and overseas, and at the same time he believed that active lay workers were essential in every parish for without them ‘the work in parish after parish is drooping for the want of this very lay help.’ He issued three questions for a daily self-examination. Is there a particular person whom I am trying to win for Christ and the church? Am I relying upon Christ for power to win men? Am I trying to excuse myself from the duty of soul-winning? <br><br><br><b>World mission</b><br><br>Brocas Waters continued the tradition of supporting CMS [the Church Missionary Society] and each year large amounts were given to the Society. The assistant clergy at JPC were also committed to CMS. John Fall, the curate from 1898 to 1900, had already served as a CMS missionary in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and from 1889 had been the vice-principal of Trinity College, Kandy; principal of St John’s College, Jaffna; and superintendent of the Tamil Cooly Mission, Haputale. Fall’s contemporary Humphrey Wightwick left JPC and spent the rest of his ministry in Australia before returning to England. <br><br>Fall and Wightwick were succeeded by James Hannington, the eldest son of Bishop James Hannington who had been martyred in East Africa in January 1885. Undaunted by the family tragedy, the younger James became a CMS missionary and returned to Uganda and in 1906, at what must have been a most moving occasion, baptised the son of Luba, his father’s murderer. Several men and women from the congregation served overseas with CMS, in Nigeria, China, Hong Kong, Uganda and Bengal. Also in Bengal JPC gave financial support to the ‘Jesmond Primary School’ in Krishnanagar. <br><br><br><b>Mission at home</b><br><br>Brocas Waters was equally concerned with home mission and actively promoted CPAS [the Church Pastoral Aid Society]. In May 1901 Brocas Waters spoke at the annual meeting of CPAS. He pleaded for ‘a new ideal of God’s claim upon us for the evangelisation of England.’ But this should not be a casual undertaking. It was essential to have ‘a definite plan of campaign … [for] … the winning of souls, [and] the spreading of the gospel.’ In concluding he challenged his hearers: ‘it depends on you and me how far these claims are heard and met in this generation.’ <br><br>In May 1905 Brocas Waters preached the CPAS annual sermon. He believed that the greatest problem facing the church was that it failed ‘to grapple with the home mission of our day’ and to reach out to ‘the overgrown populations of the poorer parts of our great cities.’ He was convinced that what was required were ‘workers, men and women of education and Christian refinement and experimental knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus’. <br><br><br><b>Training Christian workers</b><br><br>In the 1890s two training homes associated with CPAS were opened in Blackheath and Bristol for the training of women for ministry. Brocas Waters was aware of these developments and in 1895 he was present at the opening of Dynevor House in Blackheath, the object of which was clear: ‘Dynevor House offers a bright and happy home to any ladies who may have received a call to home mission work, and who are prepared to throw themselves heartily into it.’ It is more than likely that these developments provided the model for the Jesmond Church House for Lady Workers that was opened by Brocas Waters in March 1899 at 21 Portland Terrace. The aim was to instruct and train women for missionary work at home or overseas, and ‘to be a centre where Christian gentlewomen may have the opportunity of devoting themselves to work for their master, free from domestic responsibility; yet with the care and cheerful surroundings of home.’ <br><br>Instruction was given in ‘Holy Scripture, church doctrine, church history, Christian evidence and other kindred subjects, as well as practical direction in the various branches of parochial work and its subsidiaries, district visiting, Sunday school teaching, mission needlework etc.’ Brocas Waters was the chaplain and lecturer in doctrine and church history and other people, including the curates, assisted with the teaching. The superintendent, Emma Leslie, who was a clergy widow, taught biblical studies. She was a woman of some experience and had previously trained women for parish work in Aston, Birmingham and was described as ‘a woman of steadfast faith and most saintly character.’ <br><br>The fees at Jesmond Church House were £50 for a one year course, and in 1901 there were five ladies in residence. One former student said, ‘I learnt so much at Jesmond, I should be delighted to have the opportunity of another year’s course.’ By the time the House closed in July 1907 nearly forty women had been trained and it was estimated that 48,049 visits had been made in the area and 3,029 meetings had been held. It is evident that Evangelical faith rather than feminism enlarged the opportunities for female Christian service at home and overseas. <br><br>In addition to recruiting and training lady workers Brocas Waters believed ‘that we should put before our boys, [and] our sons, the call of God to the ministry of his church’ and ‘that we should put before our girls the office of deaconess in the church of Christ as a possible profession for life, and not let them think that to be suitably married is the only thing to be aimed at.’ A number of men from the congregation trained for ordained ministry. <br><br>Bible reading and prayer were central to the life of JPC. Outline sermons and prayer topics were included in the parish magazine, and members of the congregation were encouraged to read their Bibles with the Scripture Union daily readings card. From February 1899 a training course on the Bible and doctrine was held on Wednesday evenings for those considering overseas service, and from May 1903 there was a Greek class for men who were considering ordination. Brocas Waters held a high view of scripture. In October 1903 in response to ‘the present attacks on the Bible’ the curate Fairlie Clark gave a lecture to men on the inspiration of scripture and Brocas Waters preached a sermon on the integrity of the Bible. <br><br><br><b>Expectant prayer</b><br><br>Brocas Waters was a man of prayer and vision and in October 1902 began the Parochial League of Prayer that continued throughout his incumbency at Jesmond. His was a ‘systematic, expectant and definite’ prayer ‘for the outpouring (or rather inpouring) of the Holy Spirit of power into every branch of the work’ and to that end he composed the following prayer for the parish: <br></p>

<blockquote><div>Gracious and Holy God, who hast revealed it as they good pleasure to give us the kingdom, grant, we beseech thee, that the work in the parish of Jesmond may be so directed, controlled and inspired, by they Holy Spirit, that it may be in all things according to thy mind, and that thy blessing may manifestly rest upon it. Fill every post with earnest whole-hearted workers. Increase, we beseech thee, with vital growth every branch of the work. So breathe through the words uttered in thy name, that many may definitely turn and give themselves to thee. Call out from this parish, both men and women as workers in thy ministry both at home and abroad. Make all who know and love thee to show forth they character and power; and cause thy ministers to be filled with faith and with the Holy Ghost. Hear us and answer us, O heavenly Father, for the sake of Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord! Amen. </div></blockquote>

<p>He repeatedly urged all true believers in the parish to pray at least once a week for: <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>1. Definite growth in every department of our parish work.2.Definite awakening or quickening of souls especially amongst our communicants.3.Definite realisation (especially among the young) of the claims of God’s work at home and abroad on both men and women.After all is said and done, we come back to prayer as the foundation of all work and success. </div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>A growing church </b><br><br>From the information that is available it is not possible to give precise attendance figures at JPC. However from 1898 to 1903 there was a 25% increase in the number of communicants and in 1907 for the first time there were 1000 Easter communicants in the parish. From April 1898 a monthly afternoon communion service was held for invalids and domestic servants, and in the following year a 7.00am communion service was begun for domestic servants. Each year there were nearly one hundred confirmation candidates. For the watch-night service in January 1901 the ground floor of the building was full [with 800 people] but the galleries were empty. There were increasing numbers attending the evening service and in April 1899 it was agreed by the seat holders that all seats unoccupied after the church bell ceased to by rung would be free. This meant that in future it would be possible to invite and welcome strangers to the evening service. <br><br>In 1898 there were a total of 700 children in the four Sunday schools in the parish, and in September 1903 Brocas Waters had written in the parish magazine, ‘we must not be satisfied until we have at least 1,000 children under instruction on Sundays.’ The prayer was answered and in 1906 that target was reached. <br>To enable the clergy to get to know the men in the parish regular ‘at homes’ took place at which Brocas Waters supplied the men with coffee and cigarettes. In 1899 the platform in the church hall was raised so that underneath it could be used to store large chairs, sofas, tables and carpets for the ‘at homes’. These occasions were attended by one hundred men. <br><br>From October 1902 a weekly conference was held for men for lectures on spiritual and other topics. In 1907 eighty men attended an inter-denominational day conference the object of which was to re-instate Sunday ‘in its proper place in the national life, as a day of rest and worship.’ In the parish magazine Brocas Waters constantly encouraged his male parishioners to attend Sunday worship. <br><br><br><b>Changes at the church</b><br><br>In the year 1898 to 1899 various minor repairs and improvements took place inside JPC. A church restoration fund was launched to raise £420 for repairs to the roof of the tower and for the rebuilding of the pinnacles; and internally making the free seats in the north aisle more comfortable; improvements to the choir stalls, and the replacement of broken cast iron heating gratings. At JPC ‘music is made a strong point, but [is] essentially congregational’ and ‘anthems are only given on Sunday evenings.’ From 1902 JPC had its own amateur orchestra and a year later J.E.Hutchinson was appointed as the organist and choirmaster and he remained in post  until 1947. <br><br>In the first few years of the twentieth century some major internal changes were made to JPC. In January 1901 to mark the fortieth anniversary a text (from Hebrews 10:19-23) was applied to the front of the three galleries. In 1901 the income and expenditure of the church was about £1,250. The most significant change to the internal appearance of the building took place in 1906. The north and south galleries were set back behind the nave columns, the fronts were provided with oak panelling to which the biblical text was reapplied, and what gas lighting remained was replaced by electricity. The west gallery was removed and a baptistry was constructed. In removing the west gallery ninety-eight seats were lost, but another eighty-one were created in the baptistry, the north gallery and the south gallery. <br><br><br><b>Jesmond Church Extension Scheme</b><br><br>Early in his ministry Brocas Waters had spoken of his vision to erect a temporary church to serve the growing number of parishioners in Jesmond. By the end of the nineteenth century three large housing developments took place – in the grounds of Goldspink Hall, in Sandyford and in Jesmond Park – and it was decided to divide the parish of 20,000 people into three. Half of the parishioners would be served by JPC, and the rest shared between two new churches – St Barnabas in Sandyford and Holy Trinity in Jesmond Park. <br><br>In October 1900 Brocas Waters, supported by one of the JPC churchwardens, launched the ‘Jesmond Church Extension Scheme’ with the aim of raising £35,000. It was estimated that the two sites would cost £6,000, the two churches £20,000, the internal fittings £4,000 and two parish halls, £5,000. <br><br>Within a month of launching the appeal £10,967 was donated and over the course of the next few years £19,392 13s 6d was given to the Extension Scheme. Donations could be earmarked for either of the two churches, and the names of the contributors were listed in the parish magazine, some of whom were particularly generous like Ralph Lambton who gave a total of £1,500. <br><br><br><b>St Barnabas, Jesmond</b><br><br>On 24 November 1900 a temporary dual-purpose church and hall was opened. The building, that could seat 350 people, was situated on Springbank Road, Sandyford. All of the fittings were portable and were removed when the building was used as a parochial hall during the week. Initially Humphrey Wightwick, the curate of JPC, was in charge, but in January 1901 he was succeeded by Henry Edwards. But the autumn there was insufficient space on Sundays and people were being turned away. <br><br>On 2 November 1901 the Bishop of Newcastle laid the foundation stone of the new church in Goldspink Lane and it was opened on 23 March 1904. The building could accommodate 511 people and all the seats were free. Some of the fitting came from the parish church and included the former choir stalls. By July the new church was out of debt. <br><br><br><b>Holy Trinity, Jesmond</b><br><br>The Bishop of Newcastle supported Brocas Waters in the provision of another church. ‘There is no reason that you should not begin your second church and many reasons why you should. So set to work: and may God prosper you in this as he has at St Barnabas’. Don’t get into debt! The name you propose [Holy Trinity] I fully approve.’ The new church was erected in two stages in October 1905 and September 1922, and the initial debt of £300 was cleared by May 1907. <br><br>Before St Barnabas and Holy Trinity were available much of the pastoral and evangelistic work among the working classes was based at the Mission Room in Brandling Village and St Christopher’s (the Mission Church). However once the new churches were operational the three churches (JPC, St Barnabas and Holy Trinity) catered for different social classes. At ‘the parish church … its work is chiefly amongst the upper classes. St Barnabas … its work is amongst the working people. Holy Trinity … its work is amongst the middle classes.’ <br><br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Brocas Waters achieved much during his ten years at Jesmond, and it was said that he was ‘a faithful and diligent pastor and preacher of power and earnestness. Canon [Brocas] Waters was much in request as a speaker at meetings throughout the county and in London … and was a leader of the Evangelical school in the Newcastle diocese.’ However, his labours were detrimental to his health, and in the summer of 1906 he was absent from his duties for three months. <br><br>Following his resignation he left Jesmond in July 1907. In the following September he became the vicar of St Mary, Bury St Edmunds, and two years later became one of the Trustees of JPC. From 1917 he was the vicar of Christ Church, Hampstead. He died of typhoid fever in September 1922 and was buried at Bury St Edmunds. <br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="That They May Have Life: Evangelicals and Catholics Together Statement">(September 2007) That They May Have Life: Evangelicals and Catholics Together Statement</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2007</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>medical ethics</li><li>embryos</li><li>unity</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>This Autumn issues of civilizational significance are going to be debated and discussed in the UK. On the one hand, the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill is to be discussed in Parliament. Among other things this, controversially, would give permission for scientists to generate combined animal-human embryos (which would be destroyed at the end of 14 days development) and also it would no longer require doctors to consider a child's need for a father when referring women for fertility treatment. On the other hand, this October sees the 40th anniversary of the 1967 Abortion Act. This Act was intended to permit abortion in rare cases, but it has resulted in abortion on demand and the deaths of millions. Some MPs want further liberalization.<br><br>However, things seem to be changing. There is a growing concern regarding abortion and not just on the part of religious leaders. Under the heading “Pro-life, pro-Hilary” Time magazine for 3 September 2007 reports that Anne Rice (famous for the Vampire Chronicles) is endorsing Hillary Clinton for President: “Clinton’s values, she says, reflect her own. The pro-life author also says she thinks Democrats - not Republicans - are more likely to end abortion.” The Sunday Times for 26 August 2007 had a headline, “Pro-life rockers clash with Amnesty.” It reported that “Amnesty International risks alienating some of its high-profile rock star backers in the row over its decision to support women’s access to abortion. The group has been accused of ‘duping’ the singers Christina Aguilera and Avril Lavigne, who have both made statements against abortion and are among contributors to an Amnesty CD released to raise money for survivors of the atrocities in Darfur.” In the same paper there is a review of a new film where one of the young amoral characters gets pregnant. The reviewer writes: “there's no real explanation as to why this ambitious career girl would keep the baby, or Ben [the father]. Her mother suggests she ‘get rid of it’, but Alison never contemplates having an abortion. It’s a curious fact that in American comedies - the recent film Waitress is another example of a woman having a baby with an unsuitable man - you can show drug-taking, unprotected sex and adultery, and swear all you want, but nobody ever mentions the dreaded a-word.” There is other evidence of what seems to be a growing opposition to abortion. Perhaps the debate over embryo experimentation has contributed to this. A great number of those who support experiments on human embryos argue that experimentation is acceptable upto fourteen days. But then after fourteen days there clearly is a problem.<br><br>To help with our thinking, praying and acting I have reprinted, with permission, a recent joint statement by a group of North American Evangelicals and Roman Catholics on these issues. There are key matters over which (certainly Anglican) Evangelicals and Roman Catholics still disagree; but they are united on a number of other issues. Their statement, THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE, in two parts, is as follows – DRJH.</i><br><br><br><br><b><i>“I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”</i> John 10:10</b><br><br><b>Part 1</b><br><br>We are grateful that as Christians, Evangelicals and Catholics together, we can speak with one voice on a matter of paramount urgency for our society and the world. We address this statement to all who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour and to all people of good will who share our concern for a more just and humane social order.<br><br>Recent years have witnessed a new pattern of convergence and co-operation between Evangelicals and Catholics. We are grateful that the project known as “Evangelicals and Catholics Together” (ECT) has played a part in this development - a development that has occasioned both controversy and high hopes within our respective communities. In the public life of our country, the changing relationship between Evangelicals and Catholics has also occasioned curiosity, anxiety, and even alarm.<br><br>This convergence has implications for our culture and civil order. In the present statement we intend, however briefly and inadequately, to make the case for what is commonly called “a culture of life” - and to do so in a way that invites public deliberation and engages questions of public policy. Our primary purpose, however, is to explain to our communities why we believe that support for a culture of life is an integral part of Christian faith and therefore a morally unavoidable imperative of Christian discipleship.<br><br>To those who do not identify with our communities, or with any Christian community, we respectfully suggest that it is in our mutual interest that they try better to understand the reasons and convictions that have recruited so many millions of their fellow-citizens to the cause of the culture of life. Greater understanding does not necessarily lead to agreement, but it at least makes possible a more civil engagement of our disagreements.<br><br>The present moment in American public life is frequently described in terms of “culture wars,” and there is some merit in that description. We need not and must not, however, resign ourselves to unremitting warfare. A culture is composed of many parts, but different cultures are distinguished by different understandings of reality, of the meaning of life and death, of rights and duties, of rights and wrongs.<br><br>There is what is called a Judeo-Christian worldview, a worldview that was crucial to the formation of our civilization and is, we believe, clearly reflected in the convictions that inspired the American founding. To speak of American culture today is to speak of a culture marked by different worldviews in conflict. So severe is the conflict, also in the political realm, that many despair of finding any commonalities by which warfare can be replaced, or at least tempered, by civil discourse. We refuse to join in that despair.<br><br>We refuse to despair because we share with those who oppose us a common humanity. We also share a common interest in sustaining the American experiment in its aspiration to be a free, just, and virtuous society. In our common humanity we share a God-given capacity to reason, to argue, to deliberate, to persuade, and to discover moral truths regarding questions related to the right ordering of our life together. As members of the community of Christians, we are obliged to bear an uncompromising witness to our faith. As members of this civil order, we are also obliged to engage respectfully those who do not share our faith. In this statement we intend to do both.<br><br>Between Evangelicals and Catholics there have been long-standing differences on the capacities of human reason. To put it too briefly, Evangelicals (and the Protestant traditions more generally) have accented that human reason has been deeply corrupted by sin. Catholics, on the other hand, while recognizing that human reason has been severely wounded by sin and is in need of healing, have held a higher estimate of reason’s capacity to discern truth, including moral truth. We, as Evangelicals and Catholics together, affirm that the knowledge of God necessary for eternal salvation cannot be attained by human reason alone apart from Divine revelation and the Holy Spirit’s gift of faith’s response to Jesus Christ the only Saviour. (These questions are addressed in more detail in our 1998 statement, “The Gift of Salvation.”)<br><br>We also affirm together that human reason, despite the consequences of sin, has the capacity for discerning, deliberating, and deciding the questions pertinent to the civil order. Some Evangelicals attribute this capacity of reason to “common grace,” as distinct from “saving grace.” Catholics typically speak of the “natural law,” meaning moral law that is knowable in principle by all human beings, even if it is denied by many (Romans 1 and 2). Thus do we, as Evangelicals and Catholics together, firmly reject the claim that disagreements over the culture of life represent a conflict between faith and reason. Both faith and reason are the gift of the one God. Since all truth has its source in Him, all truth is ultimately one, although our human perception of the fullness of truth is partial and inadequate (1 Corinthians 13:12). Thus do we invite those who disagree, including those who do not share the gift of faith in Christ, to join with us in attempting to move beyond “culture wars” to a reasonable deliberation of the right ordering of our life together.<br><br>As Christians, we are informed, inspired, and sustained by our faith in a commitment to a culture of life, which includes the protection and care of the unborn, the severely disabled, the dependent elderly, and the dying. The culture of life encompasses also the poor, the marginalized, and those who, for whatever reason, are vulnerable to neglect or exploitation by others. This is not a uniquely Christian commitment. Disagreement on our obligations to those in need should not be viewed as a conflict between Christians and non-Christians.<br><br>We are sadly aware that many who identify themselves as Christians do not share our understanding of a culture of life. It is not the case that we wish to “impose” our moral convictions on our fellow-citizens or, as some recklessly charge, to establish a “theocracy.” Our intention is not to impose but to propose, educate, and persuade, in the hope that, through free deliberation and decision, our society will be turned toward a more consistent respect for the inestimable gift that is human life.<br><br>This statement and the questions addressed are emphatically public in nature. Christianity—its scriptures, doctrine, intellectual tradition, and institutions of communal allegiance and mission—are part of our common history. Christianity claims at least the nominal adherence of the great majority in our society. To be a Christian is a personal but not a private decision. To be a Christian is to be associated with a historical movement bearing public witness to universal moral truths.<br>Such truths are not accepted by all in our society, nor is there complete agreement about their meaning and implications among all who do accept them. But the assertion of these truths, including their significance for public policy, is part of, and in no way to be excluded from, genuinely public discourse. Whatever is meant by “the separation of church and state,” it cannot mean the separation of public life and public policy from the deepest convictions, including moral convictions, of the great majority of a nation’s citizens.<br><br>As Christian truth claims are public, so also are the questions pertinent to a culture of life. There is no more inescapably public and political question than who belongs to the polis of which we are part. The contention over abortion, for instance, is not about when human life begins. That is a biological and medical question about which there is no reasonable dispute. The moral and political dispute is over which human beings, at whatever state of development or decline, possess rights that we are bound to respect. The question is this: Who belongs to the community for which we accept public responsibility?<br><br>In what follows we hope to make the case that the defence of the humanum is an inescapable consequence of the gospel. Our position with respect to questions such as abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and the creation and destruction of embryos for research purposes is integral to the Christian understanding of reality. Every human life is, from conception, created by God and is infinitely precious in His sight. The fulfilment of human life is, by the grace of God, “life and life abundant” through faith in Jesus Christ who said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).<br><br>We believe it is of utmost importance that everyone involved in the public discussion of these questions understand the unbreakable connection between a Christian worldview and the defence of human life. We can no more abandon our contention for a culture of life than we can abandon our allegiance to the lordship of Christ, for our contention is inseparably part of that allegiance.<br><br>At the same time, we contend that the public policies pertinent to the defence of the humanum are supported by reasons that are accessible to all and should be convincing to all. The term “humanism” is frequently employed in opposition to Christian faith, as in the phrase “secular humanism.” We propose a deeper and richer humanism that is firmly grounded in the bedrock of scriptural truth, that is elaborated in the history of Christian thought, that is in accord with clear reason, that honours the best in our civilization's tradition, and that holds the promise of a future more worthy of the dignity of the human person who is the object of God’s infinite love and care. This more authentic humanism is in no way alien to Christianity. There is in world history no teaching more radically humanistic than the claim that God became a human being in order that human beings might participate in the life of God, now and forever.<br><br><br><b>Part 2</b><br><br>Our contention for a culture of life is made possible and imperative by the gospel of life. The word “gospel” is used in different ways. Gospel (from the Greek <i>euangelion</i>) means good news. The Apostle Paul writes: “Now I would remind you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you the gospel, which you received, in which you stand, by which you are saved, if you hold it fast – unless you believed in vain” (1 Corinthians 15:1-2). The good news is centred in Jesus Christ—his birth, teaching, healing ministry, holiness of life, redemptive suffering and death, his resurrection victory over sin and death, his present reign, his abiding presence with his disciples, and his promised coming in glory to restore all things to God. “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation” (2 Corinthians 5:19). The good news is that, despite all the evil for which we human beings are responsible, “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him” (John 3:16-17).<br><br>The gospel of life includes the very creation. All that exists is brought into being and sustained in being by love and for love, for “God is love” (1 John 4:8). The whole of creation is a gift and constitutes an order graced by the love of God. In that same love, God bestowed upon humanity a unique dignity. “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it’” (Genesis 1:27-28). Of life in all its created forms we are told, “And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good” (Genesis 1:31).<br><br>God did not recant that judgment even when man turned against God and, as a consequence, against his brother. To Cain, the first murderer, God says, “The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground” (Genesis 4:10). The cry of innocent blood did not go unheeded but began the long gospel story of restoration, including the covenant with Abraham and the people of Israel which prophetically points toward the culmination of God’s self-revelation and redemptive work in Jesus Christ. Thus humanity is called “to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel” (Hebrews 12:24). In Christ the dignity and eternal destiny of humanity is restored. St. Paul declares, “For as by a man came death, by man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Corinthians 15:21-22).<br><br>The radical humanism of Christianity was and is a new thing in history. Irenaeus, the second-century Church Father, declared, “The glory of God is man fully alive.” From the earliest non-canonical Christian writing, the <i>Didache</i> (probably written in the latter half of the first century), we learn how Christians confronted the pagan culture of the time:<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>There are two ways, a way of life and a way of death; there is a great difference between them. . . . In accordance with the precept of the teaching “You shall not kill,” you shall not put a child to death by abortion or kill it once it is born. . . . The way of death is this: They show no compassion for the poor, they do not suffer with the suffering, they do not acknowledge their Creator, they kill their children and by abortion cause God’s creatures to perish; they drive away the needy, oppress the suffering, they are advocates of the rich and unjust judges of the poor; they are filled with every sin. May you be ever guiltless of all these sins!</div></blockquote>

<p>There are many ways in which the dignity of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God, is violated. Both historically and at present there is genocide, unjust war, innocent victims of just wars, economic exploitation, the neglect and abuse of children, the disrespect and mistreatment of women, the abandonment of the aged, racial oppression and discrimination, the persecution of religious believers, and religious and ideological fanaticisms that are the declared enemies of freedom. The depressing list goes on and on. We have no delusions that such evils will be entirely eliminated before Christ returns in glory to set all things right. But, as in the apostolic era, so also in our time, Christian witness and life is to stand in clear contrast and opposition to such evils, for we are called to be “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:13-14).<br><br>While we cannot remedy all the evils in the world, we can—if we are prepared to suffer and even die rather than to do evil—always refuse willingly to participate in, support, or condone the doing of evil. The way of the gospel of life is in the keeping of God’s commandments, which are summarized in this: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.” Jesus said, “Do this and you will live” (Luke 10:28).<br><br>The love of neighbour takes many forms. In Matthew 25 the righteous are rewarded and the wicked condemned by the measures of whether they fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty, welcomed the stranger, clothed the naked, and visited those who are sick or in prison. By these and other measures of love for our neighbour, we all fall short. Love for the neighbour begins, however, with respect for the neighbour's right to be, by honouring the gift of God that is the neighbour's life. Thus the most basic commandment of neighbour-love is, “You shall not kill” (Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17). “You shall not kill” is rightly understood as “You shall not murder.”<br><br>Recognizing the honourable exception of those who embrace absolute pacifism, Christians believe that there are moral duties to protect life that may entail the taking of life, as in defence against lethal aggression. Most Christians, past and present, have also considered capital punishment to be morally permissible, citing the words of St. Paul that the ruler “does not bear the sword in vain; he is the servant of God to execute his wrath on the wrongdoer” (Romans 13:4). Some hold that capital punishment is not necessary to protect society and therefore is not morally permissible, while others hold that it is both permissible and necessary.<br><br>Our differences on capital punishment are not differences between Evangelicals and Catholics, but are based on different judgments regarding the need for capital punishment, at least in developed societies, and on the widespread perception that capital punishment is in tension, if not conflict, with a consistent ethic of life. At the same time, we are in firm agreement on the critical moral difference between killing the innocent and punishing those who are guilty of killing the innocent.<br><br>The ominous, and still recent, development in our society and others is the addition of new justifications of killing. Beyond self-defence, just war, and capital punishment, the principle is now asserted and supported by appeal to law that we are justified in killing human beings who are, for whatever reason, unwanted or deemed to be an excessive burden to others.<br><br>There is today no rational disagreement that the child in the womb is, from conception, a living being that is undeniably a human being. Barring natural tragedy, as in miscarriage, or lethal intervention, as in abortion, this being will become what everyone recognizes as a human baby. It is false and pernicious to claim that the unborn child is, at early stages of development, only a potential human being. No life that is not a human being has the potential of becoming a human being, and no life that has the potential of becoming a human being is not a human being.<br><br>Every human life is intended by God from eternity for eternity. Human life is sacred because it is the creation of God, the Lord of life. “For you did form my inward parts, you knit me together in my mother’s womb” (Psalm 139:13). Nature shares in the consequences of sin and innumerable lives are lost before they have an opportunity to develop in the womb, as many die in disasters such as famine, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Mortality is the common denominator of all life on earth. We are morally responsible, however, for the protection and care of life created in the image and likeness of God. The commandment, “You shall not kill,” is the negatively stated minimum of what we owe to our fellow human beings.<br><br>The direct and intentional taking of innocent human life in abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and embryonic research is rightly understood as murder. In the exceedingly rare instance of direct threat to the life of the mother, saving her life may entail the death of the unborn child. Such rare and tragic instances are in sharpest contrast to the unlimited abortion licence created by the Supreme Court, resulting in more than forty million deaths since 1973.<br><br>The blindness of so many to this moral atrocity has many sources but is finally to be traced to the seductive ways of evil advanced by Satan. Jesus says, “He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies” (John 8:44).<br><br>The direct and intentional taking of innocent human life may be attended by what is believed to be compassion, especially in the case of the dependent and debilitated aged. While we can sympathize with those who view their own life or the life of another as a burden and not a gift, and while, by the grace of God, there can be repentance and forgiveness for those who are guilty of committing great evil, there can be no moral justification of murder. We are determined to employ every legal means available to protect, in law and in life, the innocent and vulnerable members of the human community.<br><br>We plead also with our fellow citizens who do not accept the authority of God’s commandments or the good news that is the gospel of life to consider the consequences of having created a licence to kill. In the present state of our tragically disordered law, citizens are given, in the case of abortion, a private “right” to kill those who are too young, too small, too handicapped, too burdensome, or, for whatever reason, not “wanted.” When this “right” and the lethal logic that supports it is established in law, there is no principled reason why it should not be applied to the “unwanted” at any point along life’s way, as advocates of eugenics, euthanasia, and assisted suicide logically contend.<br><br>The inescapably public question posed is whether we as a political community adhere to the founding proposition articulated in the Declaration of Independence that all people are endowed by their Creator with certain “unalienable rights,” beginning with the right to life. The course of progress in our political history has been one of inclusion rather than exclusion. Most notable has been the inclusion of slaves and their descendants, and the recognition of the political rights of women. The foundational moral claim on which our polity rests is the claim that all human beings are created equal and are the bearers of rights that we are obliged to respect.<br><br>Among the most encouraging developments of recent decades, in our society and the world, is the increased interest in the defence of human rights. This has occurred in large part in reaction to the unspeakable horror of ideologically driven mass murder under the regimes of Nazism and Communism which denied the equal rights of all. Especially heartening is the growing involvement of Christian communities in the defence of religious, political, and civil rights around the world. Such concern is premised upon the conviction that all human beings are created equal with respect to God-given rights that we are bound to respect. That is the premise attacked by the current abortion regime and related aggressions against the gift of life. Rights are not to be confused with individual desires or felt needs. Rights are joined to duties. Those who cannot assert their rights depend upon others doing their duty. The right to be protected entails our duty to protect.<br><br>The inescapable question is this: Why should we care about those who are weak, dependent, burdensome, unproductive, and undeveloped or gravely diminished in their capacity for the interactions we associate with being human? If we are unable to give a morally principled answer to that question, the very concept of human rights is emptied of obliging force and reduced to utilitarian calculation or arbitrary sentiment. The lethal logic invoked in support of the abortion licence imperils the lives and well-being of millions who are severely handicapped or who are cared for in the many thousands of facilities for the aged and radically dependent.<br><br>Those most in need of defence are those who cannot defend themselves. We are called to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. Among the most defenceless are the unborn child, the severely disabled, and the dependent elderly. There are today legal protections of the disabled and elderly, but the unborn are totally dependent and totally vulnerable to the will of others. Once fully born, they are deemed to have rights that are protected in law, even though they are at that point no more human beings and no less dependent than they were hours, weeks, or months before. Yet before birth, and even in the very process of being born, they are now deemed not to have rights that society is obliged to respect. This perverse view of human rights is irrational and incoherent. Its result is the unjust killings of many millions of those who are indisputably human beings, and the undoing of the very concept of human rights.<br><br>We recognize that, short of Our Lord’s return in glory, there will always be great evil in the world. Human history is the drama of conflict between truth and falsehood, light and darkness, life and death. The witness to the gospel of life echoes today the words of Moses to the children of Israel: “I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life that you and your children may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19). With the apostle Paul, we contend, and call others to contend, against the “principalities and powers” of the present darkness (Ephesians 6:12).<br><br>There will likely always be abortions, as there will be other great evils. In the words of Jesus, “Temptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come” (Luke 17:1). While sin and temptations to sin are constant, the notion that the killing of the innocent is a “right” in law is relatively recent, and has thrown our society into legal, political, and moral confusion and conflict. The way to justice and restored civility is a firm commitment to the goal of a society in which every vulnerable human being, including every unborn child, is protected in law and welcomed in life.<br><br>The healing professions in our society have been deeply corrupted by the culture of death. Not only in abortion but also in practices such as doctor-assisted suicide, the noble calling of medicine has been grievously debased. In medical education, we witness the ominous abandonment of the Hippocratic Oath and its prohibition of killing.<br><br>We earnestly plead with medical practitioners to recover the moral integrity of their profession. With specific reference to the aged, the debilitated, and the dying, it is often the case that restoration to health is not possible. But no life is without value or is unworthy of life. While there is no obligation to prolong the process of imminent death, the intentional hastening of death is morally prohibited. The healing profession is also the caring profession. We cannot always heal, but we can always care. Also in the most difficult of cases, it is a perverse and twisted idea of compassion that seduces medical practitioners into violating the imperative always to care and never to kill. We gratefully acknowledge and prayerfully encourage medical practitioners who strive to restore their profession to the unqualified service of life.<br><br>We are keenly aware of the burden of guilt borne, and often painfully experienced, by those who have been complicit in the culture of death. Women beyond numbering mourn for their children whom they denied the living of the life that was theirs. As with King Herod’s killing of the innocents, so also now: “A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she could not be consoled, because they were no more” (Matthew 2:18). A striking feature of the movement against abortion is the leadership of women who have experienced the horror and heartbreak of abortion and plead with their sisters to choose life. They and many others work selflessly in helping women with crisis pregnancies, and also in assisting with adoptions.<br><br>Men beyond numbering are complicit in the culture of death. The legal abortion licence has made it easier to sexually exploit women; to abandon them or refuse to support them in the bearing of the new life for which men are equally responsible; and even to coerce them into having the child killed. This is a wickedness of unspeakable proportions, and is only compounded by men who self-servingly construe the abortion licence as a form of liberation for the women they exploit.<br><br>As the sin is great, so is God’s mercy greater. “In this God shows his love for us, that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we are now justified by his blood, much more shall we saved by him from the wrath of God” (Romans 5:8-9). As the psalm declares:<br></p>

<blockquote><div>For as the heavens are high above the earthso great is his steadfast lovetoward those who fear him;As far as the east is from the west,so far does he removeour transgressions from us. (Psalm 103:11-12)</div></blockquote>

<p>We thank God for the women and men who, having been complicit in the evil of abortion, have been led to contrition, repentance, and newness of life; for abortionists who have abandoned their trafficking in death; for those who have established thousands of crisis pregnancy centres to assist women in troubled circumstances to welcome the gift of new life; and for all who have over the years sustained a growing pro-life movement for change toward a culture of life. This is a movement for change that, more than any in American history, claims the allegiance of millions who have no personal stake in the cause other than the protection of the innocent. It is most particularly gratifying that the leadership of this movement is now passing to a younger generation that views with horrified repugnance an abortion regime to which so many of their elders had become morally numbed.<br><br>Even as the dark years of the unlimited abortion licence may be coming to an end, the culture of death insinuates itself into the sciences, and most particularly into the field of biotechnology. The creation and destruction of human life for research, cloning, and related purposes underscore the truth that the pro-life movement is for the duration - meaning until Our Lord returns in glory.<br><br>Our churches do not simply support the pro-life movement as a social cause. Because the gospel of life is integral to God’s loving purpose for his creation, the Church of Jesus Christ, comprehensively understood, is a pro-life movement continuing God’s mission until the end of time. In the light of this truth, we plead with Christians who support the legal licence to kill the innocent to consider whether they have not set themselves against the will of God and, to that extent, separated themselves from the company of Christian discipleship.<br><br>There are no doubt many reasons for our society’s perilous drift toward a culture of death. One major cause is the abortion regime established by the Supreme Court by the Roe v. Wade decision of January 22, 1973. That decision is rightly described as an act of raw judicial power that eliminated in all fifty states existing legal protections of unborn children. It is an encouraging measure of the moral health of our society that the abortion licence decreed by Roe has not been accepted by the great majority of Americans. It now seems possible that this question will be returned to the process of democratic deliberation and decision in the several states. In that process, we as Evangelicals and Catholics together pledge our relentless efforts to persuade our fellow-citizens to secure justice in law for the most vulnerable among us.<br><br>While political and legal developments are important, they are not of paramount importance. Deeper and of greater consequence is the moral and cultural impoverishment in our understanding of the gift of life, of our duties to others—especially to those who are most dependent—and of individual freedom that finds its true fulfilment not in licence but in love.<br><br>Our public culture is debased by distortions of sexuality that are antithetical to the flourishing of marriage, fidelity, and parenthood. The indispensable institution of the family, which is the sanctuary of life, is widely devalued and weakened by divorce. Moreover, while we are not agreed on the moral permissibility of artificial contraception, we recognize the sad effects of a widespread “contraceptive mentality” that divorces sexual love from procreation and views children as a burden to be avoided rather than as a gift to be cherished. We plead with the members of our communities, Evangelical and Catholic, to consider anew the call to be open to new life, and the meaning of that call for the relationship between unitive and procreative sexual love within the bond of marriage.<br><br>Finally, our society’s drift toward a culture of death will not be arrested and reversed without a bolder and more persuasive witness to the gospel of life centred in Jesus Christ who is “the way, the truth, and the life.” Whatever our cultural circumstance, whatever the ebb and flow of political and legal fortunes, our first duty is evangelization: to share “in season and out of season” (2 Timothy 4:2) the good news of the unsurpassable gift of eternal life, beginning now, in knowing Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.<br><br>To know him is to serve him, also in contending for a more just social order that defends the gift of life wherever it is threatened. As did the early Christians to the society of their time, so we propose to our fellow-citizens a new humanism. This biblical humanism is deeply grounded in the dignity of the human person at every stage of development, disadvantage, or decline; it is supportive of the founding convictions of our nation; and it holds the promise of keeping at bay the barbaric devaluations of human life to which history is so manifestly prone.<br><br>We cannot and would not impose this vision of a culture of life upon others. We do propose to our fellow-Christians and to all Americans that they join with us in a process of deliberation and decision that holds the promise of a more just and humane society committed, in life and law, to honour the inestimable dignity of every human being created in the image and likeness of God. For our part, as Evangelicals and Catholics together, we refuse to despair of the power of public witness and persuasion in the service of every member of the human community, for whom Christ came “that they may have life and have it abundantly.”<br><br>Signatories<br><br><i>Evangelical Protestants:</i> <br><br></p>

                <p><b>Paul Vitz</b></p>

<p>In 1999 Paul C Vitz wrote the Faith of the Fatherless an important book with the subtitle, "The Psychology of Atheism". Vitz is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at New York University; and here is his Christian testimony: "after a rather wishy-washy Christian upbringing, I became an atheist in college (at the University of Michigan in the 1950s) and remained so throughout graduate school (at Stanford University) and my first years as a young experimental psychologist at New York University. I rediscovered Christianity in my late thirties in the very secular environment of academic psychology in New York City." He continues as follows:<br><br>"On reflection, I have seen that my reasons for becoming, and remaining, an atheist-skeptic from age eighteen to age thirty-eight were, on the whole, superficial and lacking in serious intellectual and moral foundation. Furthermore, I am convinced that these reasons are common among Americans, especially in intellectual, academic, and artistic communities and in the media. As a student of psychology, I was supported in my atheism by various general ideas. The argument - criticized here [in the book] - that God is a projection of psychological needs, particularly childish needs, was one that I accepted. Supporting this psychological interpretation was a cultural or anthropological critique of belief as such. I am not sure where I learned it, though I do remember enjoying a course at the University of Michigan taught by an outspokenly atheistic professor of anthropology. I also believed in 'evolution', including the evolution of world views. It seemed to me that primitive man had gods, goddesses, and spirits of many types: in this animistic phase, deities inhabited many natural locales (springs, woods, impressive animals, large distinctive rocks, and the like). Somewhat more 'advanced' cultures had fewer deities but were still polytheistic. By the time of the Greeks or the Egyptians, there were a relatively small number of gods and goddesses, with a fairly clear hierarchy; Judaism introduced monotheism as the natural conclusion of this progression from many to one. And of course the final answer for the 'mature modern mind' was to do away with the divine altogether, to understand the whole process as a form of intellectual evolution or maturation. Thus, the evolution from many to few to one to none appeared to be both an historical and logical progression.<br><br>Of course, I never seriously investigated the evidence for this view or questioned it in any way. It just seemed correct and obvious."<br><br>He then listed some other reasons for his atheism, the final one of which was "simple personal convenience". "The fact is that, in the powerful secular and neopagan world of today, it is quite inconvenient to be a serious believer. I would have had to give up many pleasures (you may use your imagination) and was unwilling to do so. And besides, religion takes a good deal of time, not just Sunday mornings; the serious practice of any religion calls for much more than that. There are other church services, as well as time for prayer and Scripture reading, not to mention time for 'good works' of various sorts. I was far too busy for such time-consuming activities. I now see," he summarizes, "that it was because of my social need to assimilate, my professional need to be accepted as part of the world of academic psychology, and my personal need for independence and an agreeable way of life that I chose to be an atheist. Hence, the intellectual basis for my atheism, like that of countless others, appears in retrospect to be much more of a shallow rationalization than an objective rationale."<br><br>This book, however, attempts to turn Freud on his head! Vitz argues that despite its claim to cool-headed rationality, modern atheism may well have originated in the irrational, often neurotic, psychological needs of a few powerfully influential thinkers. He takes "the apostles of atheism" and subjects them to the same psychological analysis they employ to debunk belief in God. This leads to the conclusion that the most likely source of their atheism was the experience in their own personal lives of "a defective father". <br><br>But first we need some history.<br><br><br><b>Some history</b><br><br>Alister McGrath, the Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford, in another book, The Twilight of Atheism. says that “the remarkable rise and subsequent decline of atheism is framed by two pivotal events, separated by precisely two hundred years: the fall of the Bastille in 1789 and that of the Berlin Wall in 1989." It is certainly true that prior to the 19th century atheism was the conviction of only a very small minority. In ancient Rome the poet Lucretius was "atheistic" but found it hard to persuade his fellow Romans. He penned that much quoted line: "Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum (religion has been a force that has brought so much evil)." His main thesis was "the world is ultimately only a collection of 'atoms', so let's be scientific and get away from priest craft and religion."<br><br>But things changed radically in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The psychoanalyst and atheist, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), was the key influence. So great was his influence that W.H.Auden described Freud as "not a person, but a whole climate of opinion". Freud, however, was simply echoing the work of an earlier atheist, Ludwig Feuerbach. Feuerbach, a German university teacher, in 1841 wrote The Essence of Christianity. There he explained his "projection theory" of religious belief. He said, "What man misses - whether this be articulate and therefore conscious, or an unconscious need - that is God." And he went on: "Man projects his nature into the world outside himself before he finds it in himself ... To live in projected dream-images is the essence of religion. Religion sacrifices reality to the projected dream"<br><br>As a young man Freud avidly read Feuerbach and, as Vitz says, took Feuerbach's position, "articulated it more eloquently and published it at a time when the audience for such a theory was much larger. And because Freud is the author, somehow the findings of psychoanalysis are assumed to support the theory. In his The Future of an Illusion he wrote: 'Religious ideas have arisen from the same need as have all the other achievements of civilization: from the necessity of defending oneself against the crushing superior force of nature.' And so he concludes that religious beliefs are 'illusions, fulfilments of the oldest, strongest and most urgent wishes of mankind ... As we already know, the terrifying impression of helplessness in childhood aroused the need for protection - for protection through love - which was provided by the father ... Thus the benevolent rule of divine Providence allays our fear of the dangers of life.'"<br><br>But what is the psychoanalytic evidence for any of this? The answer is there is none. Vitz writes: "In a letter of 1927 to his Oskar Pfister (an early psychoanalyst and believing Protestant pastor) Freud wrote: 'Let us be quite clear on the point that the view expressed in my book [The Future of an Illusion] form no part of analytic theory. They are my personal views.'"<br><br>Freud, however, makes you think that he is very familiar with the psychology of belief in God. "Such," says Vitz, "is not the case. In fact, Freud had very little psychoanalytic experience with patients who believed in God or were genuinely religious. None of his published cases deals with a patient who believed in God at the time of the psychoanalysis. That is, nowhere did Freud publish a psychoanalysis of the belief in God based on clinical evidence provided by a believing patient. He never presented publicly any serious psychological evidence for his projection theory or for his other ideas about religion. Instead, Freud's peculiar personal obsession with religion is primarily focused on texts and issues drawn from anthropology, history and literature - not from any cited psychoanalytic experience ... It is important to add that, to the best of my knowledge there is no systematic empirical evidence to support the thesis of childhood projection being the basis of belief in God. Indeed, the assumption that religious belief is neurotic and psychologically counterproductive has been substantially rejected. Instead, there is now much research showing that a religious life is associated with greater physical health and psychological well-being."<br><br>In Freud's work two key assumptions are the unconscious and what he called the "Oedipus complex". That was where an unconscious sexual desire of a young male child for its mother leads to an intense hatred and fear of its father. This then gets resolved in various ways but never completely. The problems are regularly reactivated at puberty. "There are good reasons to give only limited acceptance to Freud's Oedipal theory," says Vitz, but it does suggest a "rationale for understanding the wish-fulfilling origin of the rejection of God."<br><br><br><b>Understanding the rejection of God</b><br><br>Freud wrote an essay on Leonardo da Vinci. In it he claimed "psychoanalysis, which has taught us the intimate connection between the father complex and belief in God, has shown us that the personal god is logically nothing but an exalted father, and daily demonstrates to us how youthful persons lose their religious belief as soon as the authority of the father breaks down."<br><br>Vitz then makes a significant comment on these words: "this interesting observation requires no assumptions about unconscious sexual desires for the mother, or even about presumed universal competitive hatred focused on the father. Instead Freud makes the simple and easily understood claim that once a child or youth is disappointed in or loses respect for his earthly father, belief in a heavenly father becomes impossible. That a child's psychological representation of his father is intimately connected to his understanding of God was assumed by Freud and has been rather well developed by a number of psychologists, especially psychoanalysts. In other words, an atheist's disappointment in and resentment of his own father unconsciously justifies his rejection of God." Vitz points out that there are many ways a father can lose his authority or disappoint a child: "he can be absent through death or abandonment; he can be present but obviously weak, cowardly and unworthy of respect, even if he is otherwise pleasant or 'nice'; or he can be present but physically, sexually, or psychologically abusive." All of these ways can contribute to what Vitz calls the "defective father" hypothesis as a determinant of atheism. But is there any evidence? The evidence is remarkable. Space forbids detailed biographies; but here are some facts about just a few of the famous atheists - Vitz cites more (and has famous theists as a control group). <br><br>Two of the morning stars of the atheistic revolution in the 18th century were David Hume, the Scottish Philosopher and the French man of letters, Voltaire. Hume was raised as a Scottish Presbyterian but lost his faith as a young man and than argued against the Christian religion in many of his writings. We know little about his childhood, but what we do know is most important: David's father, Joseph, died in 1713 when the philosopher-to-be was only two years old. Voltaire rejected the God of the Bible and denied the reality of sin, but still believed in some impersonal ultimate being - "a cosmic, depersonalized God of unknown character". But, records Vitz, " the psychologically important thing about Voltaire is that he strongly rejected his father - so much so that he repudiated his father's name (Arouet) and took the name 'Voltaire'."<br><br>Then take Ludwig Feuerbach, Freud's hero. His father, a distinguished jurist and criminologist, left his wife and home when Feuerbach was 9. He then lived very publicly with a woman in another town who bore him a child. He only returned on his lover's death and when Feuerbach was 18. Another significant influence on modern atheism was Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). Nietzsche is best known for his claim that "God is dead." His father died when he was four years old. Aged 24 he wrote that his father "died all too soon. I missed the strict and superior guidance of a male intellect." Nevertheless, he saw his father as weak and sickly, lacking in the "life force". This he put down to his father's Christianity.<br><br>A little younger than Nietzsche was Freud himself (1856-1939). Freud certainly had problems with his father, Jacob, whom he saw as weak, not least in his passive response to anti-Semitism. Worse still, in two of his letters written as an adult, he writes that his father was a sexual pervert and his children suffered accordingly. Ten years younger than Freud was H.G.Wells (1866-46) whose influence came through his Outline of History. He was one the great popularizers of ideas before the Radio and TV age. Wells had a hatred for God and a contempt for his incompetent cricket-playing father. All this is documented in his autobiography.<br><br>When I was at school and university in the fifties and sixties, the most significant atheist, with a huge influence on both morals and religion, was Bertrand Russell (1872-1970). His father died when he was 4. Also influential while I was at school and university was the Frenchman Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) with his existentialist philosophy of post-modern relativism: "If one discards God the father [which he did], there has to be someone to invent values ... To say that we invent values means nothing else but this: life has no meaning a priori. Before you come alive, life is nothing; it's up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing else but the meaning you choose". Sartre's father died in 1906 when Sartre was only fifteen months old. The father of his atheistic contemporary, Albert Camus (1913-1960), died in 1914 at the Battle of the Marne, when Albert was one year old. <br><br><br><b>Stalin, Hitler, Marx and some observations</b><br><br>What, however, about the two great political atheists - Stalin (1879-1953) and Hitler (1889-1945). A friend who knew Stalin wrote: "undeserved and severe beatings made the boy as hard and heartless as the father was. Since all people in authority over others seemed to him to be like his father, there soon arose in him a vengeful feeling against all people standing above him." Hitler's upbringing was similar. Hitler's father was described as "authoritarian and selfish, and showing little concern for the feelings of his much younger wife and little understanding of his children" and "a hard unsympathetic and short-tempered man."<br><br>Karl Marx (1818-1883) who, like Freud, followed Feuerbach's projection theory regarding belief in God, may be a partial exception to the "defective father" hypothesis. Marx' father came from a long line of Jewish rabbis but he converted to Christianity primarily for social reasons. Such a superficial conversion, of course, may have diminished Karl's respect for his father. However, there is no clear conflict or estrangement between the older Marx and Karl. But in his late teens Karl radically rejected his "bourgeois background" and so all his father stood for.<br><br>Vitz discusses these studies and provides significantly more detail. I have just given the simple facts as relate to a "defective father". Vitz refers to other factors as well as the simple father-child relationship.<br><br>So what are the conclusions? What did Vitz say? One of his own serious concerns is this:<br><br>"Nietzsche, Marx and Freud are famous as formulators of powerful theories, but these atheist masters do not bother to argue whether religious beliefs are true or false. Instead they ask what motives would lead people to hold such beliefs. As we have seen, this mode of inquiry is equally applicable to them and their ideas. It is certainly time for such critical suspicion to be applied to the 'atheistic' structures of government, law, media and academia that have arisen in our time."<br><br>Vitz argues that a good case can be made that historically important atheists have as one significant factor in their atheism a "defective father" which can be seen as contributing to their own "projection of atheism" onto a world that is created by the true and living God.<br><br>However, Vitz does not believe that his analysis will necessarily convince any unbelievers. He says, "since both believers and non believers in God have psychological reasons for their positions, one important conclusion is that in any debate as to the truth of the existence of God, psychology should be irrelevant ... The present study is an argument in favour of the pre-modern idea that controversies should be settled on the basis of evidence, not on the psychology of the interlocutors."<br><br>One piece of evidence that needs to be addressed relates to the assumed evolutionary progress of religion from the primitive to the sophisticated. Auguste Comte (1789-1857) argued for this evolutionary progress - from the theological (animism to polytheism to monotheism) to the metaphysical to the scientific. Nietzsche, Marx, Freud and many others inherited this evolutionary tradition. <br><br>However, the anthropological evidence is to the contrary and this evidence was available "years before Freud's religious theorizing" in Andrew Lang's work of 1898 on Australian aborigines. More recently Lang's work has been confirmed. It is said that a genuine feature of primitive religion in both Australia, South America and North America is a religion of a "High God" or "Supreme Being" who is not a ghost of the dead or some lower deity raised to a higher power. Furthermore one anthropologist has reported that "the name 'father' is applied to the supreme being, as is the name 'creator'. Also this figure is seen as utterly righteous with his response to anything morally bad being to abhor it and punish it. The moral life of these primitive tribes is determined by their understanding of the rewards and punishments from this morally good supreme being." Vitz concludes that no evolutionary model that makes monotheism a relatively late development can be considered acceptable on empirical grounds. Monotheism, it seems, leads to polytheism when tribes meet and blend. The evidence suggests then that religious history is one of devolution or regression - from one god to a few gods to many gods, and, finally, in the modern period, to every person a god. This, of course, is in line with St Paul's teaching in Romans chapter 1.<br><br><br><b>P.S.</b><br><br>If Vitz is right, you would expect that a breakdown in marriage would lead to an increase in atheism; we have such a breakdown and we an increase.<br><br>If Vitz is right, many atheists will have painful memories and experiences, so evangelism needs to be sensitive.<br><br>The great evidence against atheism is still the Resurrection of Jesus.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Why get Married in Church?">(December 2007) Why get Married in Church?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2007</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>marriage</li><li>commitment</li><li>society</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>On the 20 November 2007 the Queen was the first British monarch, ever, to have celebrated a diamond wedding anniversary. On 20 November 1947 with 2000 invited guests the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were married in Westminster Abbey, London. But why? Why marriage and why in a church? These are questions many are asking today. It is vital that they have clear answers. The breakdown of marriage that has taken place over the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's married life is seriously destroying Britain. Iain Ducan Smith has produced an important report Breakthrough Britain which, following so many similar reports, makes it clear that the breakdown of the married family is leading to social disaster, not least for children.<br><br><b>Why marriage and why a church wedding?</b><br><br>"Why do you want to be married in church?" is the <i>first</i> question I always ask couples who are thinking about a wedding celebration at Jesmond Parish Church. There are various answers they give. But the fundamental answer is threefold, because at least three things happen in a church wedding.<br><br><b><i>First</i>, the couple are calling God to witness their marriage vows.</b><br><br>These vows or promises are right at the heart of the service. So when you marry in church you are saying that you do not only want your family and friends to be witnesses to your vows. You are saying you also want Almighty God to be a witness. The very first words of the marriage service are these:</p>

<blockquote><div>We have come together in the presence of God, to witness the marriage of John and Janet (or whoever).</div></blockquote>

<p>So that is the <i>first</i> thing people are doing and, therefore, the <i>first</i> reason for being married in church.<br><br>A God-given gift<br><br><b>The <i>second</i> thing happening in a Church wedding is this. People are saying "Yes" to Jesus Christ's and the Bible's teaching on marriage.</b><br><br>The start of the service underlines one of the most important truths of this teaching in these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Bible teaches us that marriage is a gift of God in creation and a means of grace, a holy mystery, in which man and woman become one flesh".</div></blockquote>

<p>Marriage being "in creation" means it comes before the Fall and so is for all human beings and not just for the Christian. Being a "gift of God" means that it is not just a human arrangement but a God-given institution. And what makes a marriage is not two people privately saying to each other, "I love you and want to live with you." No! It is two people saying to each other, "I love you and want to live with you. But I want publicly to make a promise to live with you for life before witnesses. I then want the law of the land to support me. I then want to make my commitment legally binding by signing a register and receiving a certificate. Then we will have sexual intercourse to consummate the marriage." The Christian following the Bible also says, "I want my love to reflect Jesus' sacrificial love for us on the cross and so be more concerned to give than to get and with duties rather than rights. God has given us the institution of marriage as a great shelter. Within this shelter we can build our relationship and, most importantly, have security for the children we hope one day to have. Yes, relationships go up and down; but marriage does not go up and down. It is not that sort of thing. It is an institution within which relationships can grow. It is marriage that grounds the relationship, not the relationship that grounds marriage." <br><br>To say and mean that is to follow the Bible's teaching on marriage. Jesus and the New Testament (the fulfilment of the Old Testament) were also strong on marriage being exclusive and permanent. Their teaching is clear. You should have no other sexual relationships before or outside heterosexual monogamous marriage; nor should you break up your marriage. That is reflected in the vows in the service. In the first set of promises each couple is asked:</p>

<blockquote><div>Will you take John/Janet to be your wife/husband? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others [so no affairs], be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?</div></blockquote>

<p>The reply is to be "I will"; and that life-long commitment is underlined in the main vows the man and the woman both promise ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health - to love and to cherish till death us do part according to God's holy law. In the presence of God I make this vow.</div></blockquote>

<p> Men and Women are different. The older Alternative Service Book fills out what "cherish" means for the man and the woman in line with the biblical understanding of marriage. So the man promises</p>

<blockquote><div> "to love, cherish and worship ... according to God's holy law" while the woman promises "to love, cherish and obey ... according to God's holy law".</div></blockquote>

<p> The phrase "according to God’s holy law [the Bible]" is very important. It defines the meaning of the words "worship" and "obey" in the promise. "According to God's holy law" there is a difference between the sexes. Also "according to God's holy law" in marriage there is to be a "biblical headship" of the man. This, however, is headship exercised through sacrificial giving and service after the pattern of Jesus himself. It is not male domineering. So “worship” is to be interpreted in its traditional and medieval sense of “worthship”, or giving “worth”, honour and support, self-sacrificially.<br><br>Then "according to God’s holy law" (and social realities) there have to be different roles in human society. One of these is leadership, even if exercised rarely and with a light touch; and leadership means some subordination. The medievals, however, distinguished political as distinct from servile subordination. Differences of role are clearly seen in areas such as the State, professional sport, the Church and marriage. In marriage men cannot biologically be mothers or women fathers. Premier [soccer] League football clubs need the roles of chairman, manager and players; and, there, the most subordinate often have the most value – £50,000 or more a week! "According to God's holy law", therefore, "obey" is to be interpreted taking note of its Latin root - "hearing respectfully" - and not of any Greek, Ancient Jewish or Muslim ideas of servile subordination. Nor "according to God’s holy law" can any subordination ever be absolute. For when man orders what God forbids or forbids what God orders, the duty is to follow God not man. Nor can biblical subordination ever be in terms of human value – "you are all one in Christ Jesus". Nor are wives to relate to husbands as children to mothers and fathers.<br><br>But, when all is said and done, the Bible gives the responsibility for the spiritual health of the family to the father. There is a spiritual headship. Hence, Adam not Eve, in the Genesis narrative of the Fall, after the man and woman had eaten the forbidden fruit, is the first to be summoned by God. Sadly, since the Fall, husbands have too often neglected that responsibility; so wives have had to take on ensuring the Christian upbringing of children. Sadly, also, too often husbands have not been sacrificially serving, but domineering. Wives, on the other hand, have too often not been respecting, but harassing their husbands. But in the Christian marriage service people are to ignore whatever the fashions of the world around happen to be at the time (these might be repressive fashions as in many Muslim States, or over-permissive fashions as in much of the West today). Rather they are saying, "Yes" to Jesus' and the Bible’s teaching on marriage. <br><br>The ring, the proclamation and prayer<br><br>In the wedding service as a symbol of that commitment wedding rings are then given and received so that in years to come someone can look at their ring and think: "Yes I made those promises to love as Christ loves me; and God has joined me together for life with my wife or husband; and God has ordained that society at large should give me support through the institution of marriage as a permanent state; and this ring is a reminder." To underline that permanence, in the Church of England service, after the minister proclaims the couple to be "husband and wife" and before the final blessing, there are these words of Jesus himself. They form the last words of the marriage itself:</p>

<blockquote><div>Those whom God has joined together let no one put asunder.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>In conclusion, the <i>third</i> thing that takes place in the service is prayer - prayer for God's help and blessing for the couple.</b><br><br>So why be married? The answer is that marriage is good for children, for the couple and for society. Not only does the Bible teach this, social science confirms it. Why be married in church? The answer should be, one, you call God to witness your vows - you know they are serious; so you want to make that commitment before him. Two, you are saying, "Yes" to Jesus' teaching on marriage, not least about marriage being exclusive and permanent - "till death us do part". And, three, you want people to pray for you.<br><br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Communication, TV and Jesmond Parish Church">(January 2008) Communication, TV and Jesmond Parish Church</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2008</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>What is a secular society?</b><br><br></p>

<p>A secular society is where there is little public reference to God - or so says one definition. On that basis Britain is certainly secular. However, it is a theistic rather than an atheistic secular society. People believe in God but do not feel they are allowed to speak about him in public.<br><br>The latest British Social Attitudes Survey shows 60 per cent of the population belonging to a specific religion. Of these 54 per cent are Christian while of the remaining 6 per cent, 2.6 per cent are Muslim; 1.2 per cent are Hindu; 0.8 per cent are Jewish; 0.8 per cent are Sikh; 0.3 per cent are Buddhist and 0.6 per cent are from other non-Christian religions. Then of the 40 per cent who do "not regard themselves as belonging to any particular religion" [the question the pollsters asked] 15 per cent, according to the official Census, while not "belonging" to the Christian religion have some allegiance to it.<br><br>These figures suggest two things. First, that it would seem wrong to classify Britain as an anti-Christian or atheistic secular society (in terms of majority opinion). Secondly, with such small percentages of other faiths, it would also seem wrong to classify Britain as "multifaith". But current political correctness has so influenced so many that conventional thinking is that the majority are committed to an atheistic secularism while the religious minority is pluralistic and multifaith. The consequence of this is that if you (wrongly) believe that no one faith attracts a greater following, you, therefore, will (wrongly) think that no one faith legitimately can expect, in a democratic society, a greater public exposure than any other. It is has then been a short step for political correctness to lead religious people to be silent in the Public Square while atheistic secularism accepts no such restraints. It has now been revealed in his interview for BBC One's The Blair Years that the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is typical of this new British, politically correct, theistic secularism. <br><br>Whatever his theology, compared with many Tony Blair is quite devout. Peter Mandelson reports that, "this is a man who takes a Bible with him wherever he goes and last thing at night he will read from the Bible." Tony Blair himself was so clear: "for me having faith was an important part of being able to do [the prime minister's job];" but while it was commonplace in the US and elsewhere for politicians to talk about their religious convictions, he added, "you talk about it in our system and, frankly, people do think you're a nutter." Not surprisingly on one famous occasion Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former Press Officer, said in tabloid fashion: "We don't do God."<br><br><b>Levels of communication</b><br><br>Such a taboo on talking about the Christian faith and the gospel in the Public Square is undoubtedly a huge barrier to evangelism and church growth.<br><br>Contrast this taboo with some African countries. What do you hear there on a main Radio News Bulletin on a Monday morning? As likely as not you will hear which church the President visited the day before! If he was giving an address at the church, it would have been fully reported.<br><br>The same, to a lesser extent, is true in the United States as Tony Blair admitted. It is easier to talk about Jesus Christ there, in public, than it is in the United Kingdom. For the moment it doesn't matter about motivation. Let us cynically assume that politicians, broadcasters, show-biz people and athletes who publicly and often talk about their faith in Christ are simply playing to the religious and Christian galleries. But even if that is so (and I do not believe generally it is), the Christian faith gets a public reference; and so it gets more and more 'public'; it ceases to be exclusively 'private'. <br><br>We have a huge way to travel in Britain before religion and Christian belief is properly in the Public Square. The trouble is that we are not yet free to communicate it. This may have less to do with religious rights or religious freedoms and more to do with a problem in communication itself.<br><br>In his book <i>Why am I Afraid to Tell You Who I am?</i> John Powell argues that we communicate on at least five different levels.<br><br>Level <i>five</i> is cliché conversation. This is very safe. It is saying, "How are you?" "How is the family?" And we get the reply, "I'm fine"' (even if we are feeling awful first thing in the morning); or "they're O.K."' (even if there is a serious problem at home).<br><br>There is no personal expression in this level of conversation. The phrases and sentences operate as pieces of etiquette.<br><br>Level <i>four</i> is reporting the facts. In this type of conversation no personal view is offered, we just report facts in a neutral way: "he said this", "she said that", "she has got a new washing machine" or "he has got a new car". Like the summary of the news on the Radio or TV we just tell factual stories. We do not commit ourselves with regard to what we think or feel about what we have said.<br><br>Level <i>three</i> is expressing ideas and judgements. This is where a greater degree of personal sharing and communication begins. "The person is willing to step out of his solitary confinement and risk telling some of his ideas and decisions." "I do not think it is right to spend too much money on clothes"; "I do not think it is right to spend too much time playing golf". At this level of communication the person is still cautious. If they sense that what is being said is not being accepted, it is possible to retreat.<br><br>Level <i>two</i> is expressing feelings or emotions. The person here shares how they feel about certain facts, ideas or judgements. "I am angry that you spend too much money on clothes"; "I get cross when you spend too much time at the golf club".<br><br>Level <i>one</i> is completely open and truthful personal communication. This level characterises all really deep human relationships, for example healthy marriages. It is hard to achieve as it involves a certain amount of risk: pretences have to go. "I applied for that job, but I know that I'm not really good enough. In their terms I'm not a first class person, I'm only second class."<br><br><b>The religious discourse level</b><br><br>In Britain for a range of reasons, as we shall see, religious conversation only easily takes place when the level of discourse is at the last two levels - at levels one or two.That is to say, you have to be talking when you are in a deep or fairly deep relationship with someone and in a context that allows a deep, or fairly deep, level of communication. If the conversation is at levels four or five <br>- the fact sharing or cliché level - religious discussion is often embarrassing. At level three - expressing ideas and judgements - people with good social skills can sometimes turn a conversation around to talk about religion.<br><br>All this has practical consequences. If you go to a party or you are having coffee in the office, quite reasonably people do not want to be intense. They want friendly, light-hearted socialising. They talk mostly at the cliché level or the factual level (with a few 'ideas and judgements' daringly thrown in). <br><br>Because generally in Britain we do not talk about religious beliefs at these levels of communication or conversation, for someone to give a personal testimony at a party or during a coffee break, is not being fanatical so much as rude. They are unilaterally deciding to alter the conventions of the group and shift the discourse level on to a different plane. At a coffee break that may be the last thing most people want. Most of the other people are simply wanting to relax before going back to work in a stressful or tiresome job.<br><br>The situation is different in other parts of the world. Certainly in many parts of Africa (and to a degree in the United States) people can talk about the Christian faith on a matter of fact level. This has advantages for evangelism and church growth. But because we cannot so easily do that in the United Kingdom, evangelism and church growth (humanly) demand greater effort. An additional range of activities are needed merely to provide a context and a social setting for appropriate discussion.<br><br>For example, if you have a mission at a church or a Christianity Explored group or similar such group, many of the church members start off by saying that they do not have any non-Christian friends to invite to the events. "I have no, non-Christian friends" has frequently been said to me by committed Christian people. It is plainly false. <br><br>What they mean is this: they do not have non-Christian friends with whom they have a "deep relationship"; they, therefore, have no non-Christian friends they can naturally talk to about religious matters. This is because in our culture to talk easily and naturally about Jesus Christ generally you have to have reached a fairly deep relationship with someone (an exception is long journeys with a stranger).<br><br>Of course, these same Christian people are not recluses. They meet many people at work. Quite a number meet people at leisure activities. They have a range of contacts and people with whom to socialise. In fact they have lots of 'friends' - but they relate to them at more superficial levels.<br><br><b>Mission tactics</b><br><br>So in a local church when an evangelistic activity is planned often there is the following suggestion: "have less church involvement over the next three months so that you have more time to make friends to bring along to the events." But what is really being said is this: "try to cultivate a few of your friends at a deeper level." There then follows a round of sometimes frenzied activity as people get to work. They have friends round for dinner, they go out together for an evening, they go on outings, they play golf, they do all sorts of things in the softening (or deepening) up process. At the end of it all they are more able to talk about their Christian faith.<br><br>This, of course, is an exhausting and time consuming process. It seems a pity that Christians cannot just go out with friends from time to time - friends they know only superficially - and enjoy themselves without forcing the pace and trying to deepen the relationship (and probably making it unnatural). It is a fact that people can only sustain a few very deep friendships. According to the New Testament Jesus seems to have had only three friends at a deep level -  Peter, James and John. These were the ones who 'shared' in his Transfiguration (Mark 9:2ff). But he clearly was friendly with many people. <br><br>Most Christians will only have a few 'deep friendships'; and these will naturally, if not inevitably, be with other Christians. That is nothing to apologise for or feel embarrassed about. So, obviously they will not have 'non-Christian friends' of that sort to invite to a local church evangelistic event.<br><br>Before long, consciously or unconsciously, some brave spirits decide that what is needed to help evangelism along is a change in the 'climate of discourse'. For what is needed is the possibility of discussing the Christian faith in conversations that do not presuppose a deep level of relationship.<br><br>One way this used to be achieved in the UK after the Second World War was to invite Billy Graham, the American Evangelist, to conduct an evangelistic mission.For the record, Billy Graham came over in 1954 (London), 1955 (Glasgow), 1961 (Manchester), 1966 (London), 1967 (London), 1984 (Mission England - Bristol, Sunderland, Norwich, Birmingham, Liverpool, Ipswich), and 1985 (Sheffield).<br><br>What happened, then, when he came? Among other things this: the 'climate of discourse' changed and people could talk about religion at parties and over coffee - without embarrassment.<br><br>Religion could then be discussed when conversation was still only at the factual level. Why was this? At a human level, principally because of the media. Billy Graham got huge Radio, TV and press coverage.<br><br>First, he was interviewed directly on Radio and TV. Secondly, that interviewing generated further Radio and TV discussion and argument about the personality, politics, finances and theology of the evangelist and everything associated with him. Thirdly, there were then broadcasts (live and recorded) from his meetings in the various stadia. <br><br>In 1984 the BBC scored a first by transmitting live the Sunday evening Mission England meeting at Sunderland on Radio 4 (it also went out on the BBC World Service). When the BBC televised one of the Birmingham meetings, that attracted 7,000 letters. And, fourthly, the press provided extensive coverage. In 1984 the press generated 50,000 column inches of newspaper space (almost all in the provinces) on Billy Graham's Mission England. All this is one reason why Christians need to work to have greater access to the media and especially electronic communication in the UK. What is broadcast (particularly on TV) becomes publicly discussable at any level apart from level one (the etiquette level).<br><br><b>Carols by Candlelight and TV</b><br><br>Once again we had over 5000 people to Carols by Candlelight at Jesmond Parish Church for Christmas 2007. It is a fact that this has now almost become institutionalized to such an extent that it easy for people to invite their friends and discuss the carol services freely and naturally at a party or having coffee. Undoubtedly our advertising in the Metro railway carriages, along with other publicity, has contributed to this freedom. It is bound, to a certain extent, to have changed 'the discourse level' in which they can freely be discussed. Indeed, even people unused to going to church can freely and easily issue invitations.<br><br>As another small contribution in the New Year in this process of desecularisation – and legitimating public discussion about God - we are hoping to be able to televise at least part of one of our Sunday services on our own internet TV. Our start is going to be very modest. But every journey begins with one step.<br><br>For too long anti-Christian broadcasting has relegated religious discourse to the margins of the Public Square.<br><br>We want to begin to make a difference. One senior BBC drama producer said rather cynically that in broadcasting you can be committed to anything except Christianity. That was in the late eighties. <br><br>But have things changed much since then? I doubt it. Furthermore, the stealth and insidiousness of the impact of broadcasting must be faced. One senior controller at the BBC has said: "The main impact of television is not through single programmes, however controversial or newsworthy, but through the steady trickle of attitudes, views and opinions." The watershed was in the sixties and seventies. It was not always like this.<br><br>When you walk into (the original) Broadcasting House next to All Soul's Church, Langham Place, London, you see in Latin the dedicatory inscription. It is full of biblical and Christian allusions:<br><br>"This temple of the arts and muses is dedicated to Almighty God by the first Governors of Broadcasting in the year 1931, Sir John Reith being Director General. It is their prayer that good seed sown may bring forth a good harvest; that all things hostile to peace and purity may be banished from this house and that the people inclining their ear to whatsoever things are beautiful and honest and of good report may tread the path of wisdom and uprightness."<br><br>John Reith was a Presbyterian who wanted the values of the BBC to be Christian. Twenty-five years later in 1948 the then Director-General, Sir William Haley, could still say this to the British Council of Churches:<br><br>"There are many demands of impartiality laid on the Corporation, but his [about Christian values] is not one of them. We are citizens of a Christian country and the BBC - an institution set up by the State - bases its policy upon a positive attitude towards the Christian values. It seeks to safeguard those values and to foster acceptance of them. The whole preponderant weight of its programmes is directed towards this end."<br><br><b>The secularisation of broadcasting</b><br><br>But by 1965 'humanism' had taken over! Sir Hugh Greene, the new Director General, seemed only committed to "truthfulness, justice, freedom, compassion, tolerance" and an opposition to "racialism or extreme forms of political belief." <br><br>But the freedom (subtly) became "freedom from positive Christian values" and a freedom for the validating of immoral behaviours and gradually the depiction of them in pornographic form. Far from this being a benign tolerance it was the beginning of the illiberal suppression of those religious values that opposed some of these developments. They were not able to be clearly stated on television. You had instead (subtly) the positive statement of the religion of humanism while parading itself as a neutral secularism.<br><br>The result of this has not been tolerance but intolerance. The orthodox and mainstream Christian community now finds itself gagged. It is not able to enjoy freely the responsible expression of views and values via the electronic media that such large constituencies in the country should enjoy. Such limited expression as it is permitted is courtesy of an overall humanistic editorial and programming establishment.<br><br>Nor is it possible to change things much by "getting involved". As a curate in the late sixties I helped set up religious programmes at the new local radio station, BBC Radio Leeds. I encouraged students to become producers. After that when teaching at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, a theological college, I wanted students to get involved in BBC Radio Oxford, but there were time constraints for us all - I was only able to produce very little. However, I was aware that unless Christians could somehow get a better stake in the evolving electronic media, humanly speaking there was little hope of stemming the insidious tide of secular humanism that would more and more erode, if not destroy, the Christian faith of millions. So after Wycliffe Hall, I believed I should seek an appointment in the BBC. However, while exploring that possibility, out of the blue I was asked to consider coming to Jesmond. This seemed right. Media interests had to go onto the back burner.<br><br>However, after six years at Jesmond I formed a consortium to bid for the North East television region - to take over Tyne-Tees. We were partially successful in that along with the other two applicants, Tyne Tees and Norseman, we all were offered a third stake in a new contracting company. We refused as we wanted all or nothing and even then our achievements from a Christian point of view might have been minimal. For this was not a company overtly to promote Christian views (which the Broadcasting Act of 1981 forbade as it still had in place censorship of all religious programmes). Rather it was intended more as a piece of social leavening.<br><br><b>Changing the law</b><br><br>It was now clear that the only sensible course of action was to try to change the law to let Christians own stations and channels. So while on the Board of Social Responsibility of the General Synod, I worked with Donald Anderson, the Labour MP, to ensure that the new Cable Act 1984 allowed Christian groups to participate in the ownership of operating companies (while still not having a controlling share) and allow them to own or lease individual channels. This was a significant development. An important principle was being established. Since the eighties this legislation has enabled Christian Satellite and Cable channels.<br><br>Christians were now beginning to see the importance of the electronic media and the consequences of their failure in not working to reverse the general slide into degeneracy. A group of us then started a campaign prior to the new Broadcasting Act of 1990 called Christian Choice in Broadcasting (the politics and struggle behind the campaign has now been written up in Hidden Agendas, the book by Professor Andrew Quicke). Positively, we secured the right for Christians to own local and regional independent Radio Stations, but nothing more. When new regional franchises were on offer, we in the North East formed a Christian company called Sound FM to bid for the new North East region (with many folk from JPC involved). A London group, Premier, formed to bid for the London region. With only one of the many new franchises likely to go to a Christian group, London had a head start with a reach of 10 million to our 2 million. Not surprisingly they were offered a franchise. We were not offered one (however, Premier’s current manager was the manager we had lined up for the North East, Peter Kerridge, from Gateshead).<br><br><b>A new age</b><br><br>Eighteen or so years later, things are now very different.<br><br>Churchwise there has been further serious decline, nationally, since 1990. Television has gone from bad to worse, with the nadir being the production two years ago of Jerry Springer the Opera on BBC Two (see the Coloured Supplement April 2006). The BBC is now seen as reducing its proportion of clear Christian programming while increasing its amount of other faith material, gay material and straight pornography.<br><br>The latter is very serious at a national level. It has been suggested that a sex or pornographic culture demotivates communal effort. An individual, says E.J.Mishan, may well ask himself about people who seem happy to tolerate such a culture …<br><br>"… are these the sort of people for whose society he must stand ready to make sacrifices? ... Can anyone care very much what happens to a society whose members are continually and visible obsessed with sexual carousal - to a society where, in effect, the human animal has been reduced to a life-style that consists in the main activity of alternatively inflaming itself and relieving itself?"<br><br>So much for the bad news. However, there is good news. Huge change is in the air. It is all to do with the internet. Lord Currie, the Chairman of Ofcom, has put it like this:<br><br>"As broadcast television overtook radio, then newspapers, so internet-delivered video content will overtake broadcast television."<br><br>What is happening is all due to "digitalization". To quote this time Rupert Murdoch, the Chairman of the News Corporation:<br><br>"The boundaries between media and adjacent sectors, such as broadband and telephony, are disappearing and this is creating an unprecedented change in the landscape."<br><br>Broadcasting, the telephone system and the internet are all converging. The new boy on the block is IPTV - this stands for Internet Protocol Television (Internet Protocol being a technical term for a networking technology).IPTV is where digital television services are not delivered through a satellite dish, an aerial or a cable, but across a broadband data network which, of course, can use a telephone line. The change is coming about because of the transition from the analogue to the digital domain. Once in digital form a telephone call or a television programme can be delivered over the same digital network. In their IPTV Guide, Cooper and Lovelace explain it in simple terms: <br><br>"In the analogue world, sounds and images are stored and transmitted in a form that has some direct correspondence to the original … As a result, analogue signals need to be kept separate, to avoid them interfering with one another . They also suffer from losses whenever they are stored or copied. In the digital domain, sounds and images, together with text, graphics and other information, can be encoded in ones and zeros and stored and transmitted as binary digits or bits. In this form they can be stored on the same disk or transmitted over the same network without interfering with one another. It is also possible to create an unlimited number of perfect copies from the original."<br><br><b>The future</b><br><br>So now telephone lines that once merely carried voice communications are able to provide broadband data services capable of delivering both live and on-demand television programmes, in standard and high definition formats, to set-top boxes connected to television screens, as well as to personal computers and other devices. "There will be an exponential expansion of channels and a proliferation of programmes available on demand" (Cooper and Lovelace). Much is uncertain. What is not uncertain is that there will be great competition between the various transmission sectors – cable, satellite, broadcasting and telephone companies together with little limitation on potential output. With a proliferation of channels and programming the viewer becomes king. And quality becomes everything – in terms of securing significant numbers of viewers. Furthermore, there will be channel hopping for all. The good programme producer of new material will be also another king. Continually multiplying channels means the market is very hungry for new high-quality, but lower cost, TV productions, including Christian material.<br><br>Currently there is a great emphasis on the new technologies and business models for the new media. At the end of the day, however, content will rule. <br><br>But with so many new possibilities of programming, who can produce new material week in and week out? One answer is the Christian churches where there the gospel is preached and the bible is taught. There is a huge source of untapped material to which the public can respond.<br><br>How important, therefore, that churches are up to speed in these early days. Hence at Jesmond Parish Church we want to be able to produce audio visual material that can both benefit ourselves but also at the same time, by using IPTV, (and www.clayton.tv, in conjunction with www.church.org.uk ) benefit thousands in the developing world where especially there is need of mainstream, orthodox, biblical teaching. We can also use other channels who would like to use our material. <br><br>Jesmond Parish Church is committed to Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain (and through our mission and international work help others bring change for the good). We are committed to making disciples (literally "learners") and committed to the "maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth" – our founders vision. Because we put our sermons up on the website right at the start of the internet revolution thousands worldwide have already made use of our material and many have said they have been helped. What we are planning is an extension of that work. It is more complicated. It needs considerably more skills. Thank God for all those with skills working to help bring this extension about - Zoë Earnshaw and those working with her. <br><br>Our vision currently is very modest - simply to film to broadcast quality an edited version of one of our services for regular broadcast. This may involve some minor sacrifices but the opportunities are a great privilege for us as a church. The beauty of digitalization is that anything you film can be put onto a DVD. So DVDs can also be used as teaching materials. We are wanting to produce teaching materials for our own use. But most of what is valuable for us will be valuable for others as well. Our vision is to pioneer and experiment so that we are up to date and ready to use, for the gospel, all the new opportunities that lie ahead. Furthermore we want to help other churches make use of these opportunities. In this way we may, among other things, be able to start a revolution that changes the public "discourse level" so that Christians can more easily talk to their friends and their neighbours about Jesus Christ. Television is not the answer to Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain. But it is one way to help "maintain and promulgate sound scriptural and evangelical truth". The way is for God to work – which he seems to be doing - and for us then to play our part. May we pray that we do so faithfully and competently and then act.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Secular State and the Oxford Union">(February 2008) The Secular State and the Oxford Union</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2008</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Benazir Bhutto</b><br><br></p>

<p>Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Pakistan on the 27 December 2007. She had twice been Prime Minister of Pakistan and the first woman to lead a Muslim state. She was, at the time of her assassination, chairing the Pakistan Peoples Party in the run up to the country’s elections. <br><br>In the 1970s she had studied at Oxford University. While there she was elected president of the Oxford Union, becoming the first Asian woman to head the debating society. For this current term the Standing Committee had already planned the first debate to be on the motion, "this House believes that the ideal state is the secular state;" and I was invited to take part. Having agreed in early December, just before the day of the debate (17 January 2008) I found that not unreasonably this had become the Benazir Bhutto Memorial Debate. There would first be tributes to Benazir by Alan Duncan MP and Victoria Schofield, both of whom knew her personally having been themselves former Presidents of the Union in Benazir's time at Oxford. Then, at the start of the debate, would follow a minute's silence "in memory of this strong and impassioned leader".<br><br>On the order paper it was announced that two undergraduates would propose and oppose, followed by (for the proposition) the Chief Executive of the BVCA (the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association); the President of the Oxford Secular Society; and the Executive Director of the National Secular Society (Keith Porteous Wood) and (for the opposition) myself; the former President of the Young Muslim Association; and the new Bishop of Worcester, John Inge, formerly vicar of Wallsend and someone I know.<br><br>Apart from the sad death of Benazir Bhutto, this was a very important subject and attracted a standing-room-only crowd. However, much of the arguing in favour of "secular states" seemed to be on the grounds that in religious states there was no sexual freedom particularly for homosexuals and the worst and most brutal Islamic states were clearly in mind. No distinction was attempted between different sorts of religious states. In 10 minutes (with interventions) it is very hard to make a sustained case on such an important subject. However, my contention is that the secular state (in the normal meaning of the term) is not the ideal state. The following is a transcript of how I tried to argue the case.<br><br><b>At the Oxford Union</b><br><br>"To oppose the motion when we are remembering a distinguished former member of this Society who was wanting Pakistan to remake itself as a secular, democratic, liberal state may seem perverse. So may I say that I wholeheartedly agree with her desire for a democratic liberal state. For such a democratic liberal state, I submit, is the ideal state. <br><br>However, such a democratic liberal state has been the fruit not of secularism, but of Christianity (I speak as a convinced Christian). To say that is not to want to go back to the middle ages and the wars of religion. Of course, not. But while we do not want to go back, we need to look back. So unashamedly I am going to talk about Britain and how we have got a democratic liberal state that is the envy of many in the world. <br><br>At the heart of democratic liberalism, you have to have something like the Judeao-Christian belief that each man and women is made in the image and likeness of God, so to be respected and equal before the law. It is a historical fact that when you lose the fatherhood of God before long you lose the brotherhood of man. You also lose other ingredients vital to democratic liberal societies - sometimes a concern for truth; often the antidote to moral anarchy; and, not least, its unique and essential liberalism. Classical liberalism – not libertarianism but liberalism - was born in the seventeenth century out of the wars of religion. It came from a Christian Puritan reaction, led by independent thinkers like John Locke of this University. The great watershed was his Letter of Toleration. In this he argued that beliefs must always be free and changed by persuasion not force. So the State (that part of society alone entitled to use force to secure obedience) must never use its force to enforce beliefs.<br><br>In the 16th and 17th centuries such enforcement was considered legitimate. There is a memorial just a few hundred yards away from this Oxford Union building to the Protestant martyrs, Cranmer, Ridley and Latimer, who in the 16th century were burnt to death at the stake in the Broad, outside Balliol, for their Protestant beliefs. The non-conforming Puritans, however, in the 17th century saw this as so wrong. After all, God allows men and women to be free. The Christian doctrine of final judgment and the doctrine of hell underlines God's willingness to allow men and women to reject him. Christian people of all people, therefore, must also allow others to reject God and his truth. So 1689, with the Act of Toleration and Locke's Letter of Toleration, was a defining moment in the history of human politics. But Locke's presuppositions were theistic not atheistic. He believed that the rights of men and women are given by God, our Creator. When his ideas 100 years later were incorporated into the American Declaration of Independence these words were used:<br><br>"… all men are created equal … they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, … among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<br><br>[After a floor intervention on the American Church-State issue, I pointed out that the American Founding Fathers were wanting to separate the State from the institutional churches not from the Christian religion. They did not want any one denomination privileged. Jefferson, indeed, allowed government sponsored chaplains in the Congress and the armed forces.]<br><br>Furthermore, not only did Locke ground his rights in transcendent reality, but his liberty was not absolute. Violence, sexual licence and religions that were clearly subversive were still not to be tolerated. <br><br><b>A theory of the secular state</b><br><br>So this British liberal Enlightenment tradition, like the American Enlightenment tradition, was tolerant of other views and beliefs while rooted in the Christian faith. This was so different to the 18th century French Enlightenment tradition that was un- (even anti-) Christian, often wanting, in the words of Tom Paine, a “religion of humanity”. <br><br>However, 100 years later still, in the 19th century, this Christian Liberal tradition was challenged by John Stuart Mill with his essay, On Liberty. This has been called "the first modern exposition of a theory of the secular state." Mill argued that the State must not only never use it power to prohibit ideas. Also it must not use its power to prohibit actions, however, self-damaging, foolish or immoral, unless harm was done to others (this clearly covered all sorts of sexual activity and related matters). But Mill's ideas remained politically dormant for the next 100 years until the 1960s. They then gave birth to a new kind of anti-Christian liberalism – which is what we now usually mean by secularism. <br><br>Since the 1960s, however, the resulting marriage breakdowns with dismembered families; sexually transmitted diseases with resulting infertility; abortions; and the results of many other anti-Christian initiatives, have given pause for thought. People are now arguing that these behaviours do harm others. On the one hand, there are harms to children who are often innocent victims; and, on the other hand, harms in terms of rising costs to tax-payers for the NHS, social services and the police as a consequence of these new secularizing permissions. It is for all these reasons that, I submit, the ideal state is not the secular state. However, the alternative to the secular state does not have to be a religious theocracy. Jesus Christ made it clear that the kingdom of God can never be coterminous with the kingdoms of this world. Furthermore, he taught the legitimacy of both God and Caesar, each with claims on us in public affairs. Secularists seem to want to do away with God and have only Caesar. That is dangerous. Some extreme religionists seem to want to do away with Caesar and have only God. That also is dangerous - this side of heaven. Mainstream Christianity, however, believes that Caesar (or the state) has a God given function. You need God and Caesar.<br><br><b>The power and empire of Christ our Redeemer</b><br><br>But a state must operate with some values and beliefs. No state can be totally neutral. For the good of all, as we have seen, a state must never enforce beliefs. There must only be persuasion with regard to beliefs. To that end, it is better, surely, for a state to have Christian values than anti-Christian secularist values. For those secularist values, grounded simply in the will of majorities, and not of Almighty God, have been, and are, too often a threat to legitimate minorities (think of Stalinist Russia and its replicas).<br><br>Such a state with Christian values, constitutionally, is Britain. So at the Coronation Service the Archbishop of Canterbury presents the orb to the monarch with these words:<br><br>"Receive this orb set under the cross and remember that the whole world is subject to the power and empire of Christ our Redeemer."<br><br>To remember that is no bad thing; and Britain and the world would be the better the more that was remembered. I beg to oppose this motion."<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Uniqueness of Jesus and the Resurrection">(March 2008) The Uniqueness of Jesus and the Resurrection</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2008</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Archbishop of Canterbury on Sharia</b><br><br>On 5 February 2008 <i>The Times</i> newspaper's "Law" supplement had as its main feature article, "Does Islam fit with our law?" It began as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>Is a clash looming between the laws of the West and Islam? In the wake of 9/11, commentators such as Samuel Huntington have spoken of a conflict between an economically powerful but increasingly amoral West, and a resurgent and moralistic Islam. There is much at stake. Can a state such as Turkey, overwhelmingly Muslim, join the EU and become party to international human rights provisions? Given that Islamic councils have been established in England, should they be recognized by English family law?</div></blockquote>

<p>It then reported that two bodies, the Temple Church (in the heart of legal London) and CIMEL (the Centre of Islamic and Middle East Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London) were about to sponsor a series of lecture-discussions on Islam in English law. The series was to be launched by Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on 7 February 2008, with a lecture he entitled "Islam in  English Law: Civil and Religious Law in England". When, on the day, he then argued that we ought to supplement our legal system by Sharia law, and appeared to be wanting to privilege Islam alongside Christianity in Britain (which still has a Christian Constitution), many were shocked. He was seen to be conceding the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ, which at law an Anglican clergyman is duty bound to uphold (see <i>Article XVIII</i> of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England). Having studied carefully both his BBC Radio 4 interview and his lecture, I strongly disagree with the Archbishop. However, the issues he raised on the nature of the state, the role of law and the place of religion in society were very important. But the question regarding the uniqueness and finality  of Jesus needs to be discussed first. (In what follows I draw on some material from my book <i>Church and State in the New Millennium</i>.)<br><br><b>Only one way or multi-faithism?</b><br><br>Is it reasonable to talk about the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ? Some will say that such belief is due to ignorance or arrogance. But ignorance is a two-way argument. Many orthodox Christians have considerable experience of other religions, often more than those who oppose them. With regard to arrogance it must be stressed that truth has nothing to do with questions of arrogance, pride or humility. Rather it has all to do with matters of fact. The claim to the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ is a truth claim and, therefore, a question of fact. That is why all claims cannot be right. Peter Cotterell, an English missiologist, puts it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>Islam says Jesus wasn't crucified. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Judaism says Jesus was not the Messiah. We say he was. Only one of us can be right. Hinduism says that God has often been incarnate. We say only once. And we can't both be right. Buddhism says that the world's miseries will end when we do what's right. We say, you can't do what's right: the world's miseries will end when we believe what is right. The fact is that the world's religions may agree about the peripheral matters but they disagree precisely about the most important matters of all. Any intelligent person could decide that all religions are wrong. Any intelligent person could decide that one is right and the rest wrong. But no intelligent person can seriously believe that all religions are essentially the same.</div></blockquote>

<p>Nor is this western triumphalism. To say that Christ is unique is not to say that other cultures are therefore automatically inferior and all is well with the West; nor is it to say even that Christian activities are unique. The uniqueness simply lies in <i>whom</i> Christians believe. It is Christ who is unique, it is claimed, not the West, or the followers who worship him. Multi-faithism, however, is felt to be, for many people, the best way forward of living together in modern Europe. But multi-faithism is not, of course, simply living peacefully together with people of different views. It is a belief in itself - a 'view' - that no one religion can claim to <i>the truth</i> and so be privileged. All must have prizes. That is the drift of so much life in the West today. And multi-faithism is motored by three pressures, <i>one</i>, an awareness of the cultural limitations of knowledge; <i>two</i>, religious experience; and, <i>three</i>, issues of justice.<br><br><b>The cultural limitations of knowledge</b><br><br>This first "pressure" relates to the sociology of knowledge, with its concept that the social environment powerfully conditions beliefs. Most of this is common-sense. It is clear that apart from a few areas of direct personal experience human beings require social support for their beliefs about reality. For example, an individual does not need someone else to prove they have toothache. But they do need social support for a wide range of religious and moral beliefs. Peter Berger puts it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>physical pain imposes its own plausibility without any social mediations, while morality [or religion] requires particular social circumstances in order to become and remain plausible to the individual.</div></blockquote>

<p>These social circumstances form in modern societies a range of "plausibility structures." Take the armed forces and public schools, as examples. So long as people are in such institutions certain values will be plausible in an unquestioned way. But once they move out and "migrate" to other social contexts these values may be questioned. This is, surely, obvious. There also seems to be a direct relationship between the cohesion of institutions and common beliefs, values and world-views. When a school is strong and effective, its pupils will most likely have the same value system in regard to discipline, manners and hard work. Similarly when institutions break up, there will be a break up of plausibility structures and a weakening of every belief and value that depend on social support. So a weak school will have pupils who are likely to be disorderly, disobedient and lazy.<br><br>It was probably because of this institutional factor that there was such an uproar over the Archbishop of Canterbury's suggestion that we should explore the possibility of England adopting some Sharia law. Apart from the worries over particular examples of Sharia law in practice, it, too, was seen as an act of institutional deconstruction - in this case of our British legal system that is rooted in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. This legal tradition is perceived as a social support for many fundamental common beliefs and values. <br><br>We need not develop this further. All that we need note is the following: the cultural limitation of knowledge and religious beliefs <i>cannot</i> be a reason for accepting a pluralistic theology of religions. Truth questions will <i>still</i> remain. <br><br>The sociology of knowledge in no way removes questions of truth. It can show why modern man finds it easier to believe in electricity than demons. But the question of the existence of demons still remains. The sociology of knowledge can show why modern Christians feel reluctant to say that Jesus Christ is God's unique and final revelation to man. But the question of whether he was, or whether he was not, also still remains.<br><br><b>Religious experience</b><br><br>The second factor that persuades some of multi-faithism is religious experience. Since Schleiermacher, the German theologian at the beginning of the 19th century, there has been the belief in a reservoir of "world spirituality". All the religions tap into it and we can all draw from it. Add to that the effect of the "History of Religions School" at the beginning of the 20th century; this school not only mapped out but tried to synthesize the religions of the world, and so reinforced a concern for experience. Add to that various pronouncements of the WCC (the World Council of Churches) in the second half of the 20th century on inter-faith matters. Then add the Roman Catholic post-Vatican II stress that God's grace is given not only through non-Christian religions but even through Atheism! And finally add the Roman Catholic Karl Rahner's talk about "anonymous Christians". Do not then be surprised when you have both a growing belief in the value of any religious experience and new "plausibility structures".<br><br>With regard to religious experience, however, traditional Christian theology has always been cautious. As Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount:</p>

<blockquote><div>Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evil doers!'" (Matthew 7.22).</div></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore the interest in religious experience is reinforced by the "concentric circle" way of looking at other religions. This may have spread originally from Roman Catholic teaching such as you have in an old Papal Encyclical <i>Suam Ecclesiam</i>. The model is of the Roman Catholic church forming the centre circle; then a little further out are other Christian churches; beyond that is a circle of other theists; beyond that a circle of various animistic and non-theistic religions; then on the far edge are the secularists with no religion at all.<br><br>But are the other religions to be measured by their nearness to or distance from Christianity? As Lesslie Newbigin said:</p>

<blockquote><div>The other religions are not to be understood and measured by their proximity to or remoteness from Christianity. They are not beginnings which are completed in the gospel. They face in different directions, ask fundamentally different questions and look for other kinds of fulfilment than that which is given in the gospel. They turn, as Otto said, on different axes.</div></blockquote>

<p>In Jesus' parable (Luke 18.9-14), was the Pharisee or the tax-collector nearer to Jesus? The Pharisee, no doubt could claim a range of religious experiences. He was committed to "fasting" - a tried and tested adjunct of religious experience. But it was the tax-collector who went down to his house "justified".<br><br><b>Justice</b><br><br>Then, thirdly, a concern for justice is behind much multi-faithism. There is the assumption that to assert the truth of the Christian faith over against other religions and world-views is essentially a denial of justice. Justice demands toleration.<br><br>However, there is so much confusion over "toleration". It has been argued that if you are truly tolerant of others, you will not critically evaluate their beliefs. But this is to equate tolerance with indifferentism. There is a commonly held but mistaken view that tolerating a religion is primarily a matter of not making a judgment about it. But that is not the case. Tolerance involves acceptance of something about which you have a negative opinion or negative judgment. You tolerate what you disagree with or dislike. This is so important.<br><br>Let me give you a humanist, non-Christian, writer on this very point - Professor Bernard Crick:</p>

<blockquote><div>Reacting against the religious disputes of the seventeenth century, toleration both as a state policy and an educated attitude began to spread in Britain in the eighteenth century. But let us remember one essential thing about tolerance. It arises because people do differ on fundamental and important things, but wish to limit the practical effect of their differences. Tolerance is not complete acceptance, still less permissiveness; it is modified disapproval.</div></blockquote>

<p>He is clearly right.<br><br>The claim to the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ is a truth claim and, therefore, a question of fact. That is why all claims cannot be right. When it comes to the Christian faith we are talking about a "gospel" or "good news" about what God has done in history. We are not talking about "good ideas". So the question is, "did God do certain things or did he not?" The key question has to be, "did God raise Jesus from the dead?"<br><br><b>The Resurrection of Jesus Christ</b><br><br>The Resurrection - the New Testament doctrine of the Resurrection, not a post-modern reconstruction of it - lies at the heart of the Christian faith. "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10.9).<br><br>But was this not just a "spiritual" resurrection of Jesus rather than a "physical" resurrection?<br><br>Now, of course, the resurrection of Jesus was not a crude resuscitation of a corpse; it was a glorious transformation. In that sense his old "flesh and blood" (to use Paul's phrase) did not inherit the new order of "the kingdom of God" <br>(1 Corinthians 15.50). But what Paul implies and the New Testament elsewhere makes quite clear is that on the first Easter morning Jesus' tomb was found empty; and it was found empty because Jesus had risen. To suggest that it does not matter if the bones of Jesus are still in the soil of Palestine is clearly contrary to the plain meaning of the texts.<br><br>People who still want to use the language of "resurrection" while denying the Empty Tomb have to say that the Empty Tomb is a myth. That is to say, they hold it is a story concocted to illustrate the meaning of "resurrection". But that is not what the Bible teaches. The Empty Tomb in the text is clearly not merely illustrative <i>of the meaning of</i> the Resurrection; it is the evidence <i>for</i> the Resurrection <i>itself</i>.<br><br>But how can we be sure that the tomb <i>was</i> empty? Is not the evidence of the texts weak? No!<br><br>The main textual evidence for the Empty Tomb is there in the Gospel narratives - the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. But the argument then sometimes put forward is that the Resurrection accounts are all so different. So they cannot be reliable. What do we say?<br><br>First, it is true that the Resurrection narratives are different in the four Gospels. But the basic difference lies in the accounts of the appearances of Jesus to the disciples, not in the accounts of how women (and others) found the tomb of Jesus empty. And it is not at all strange that the Gospel writers have different accounts of the appearances of Jesus to his disciples. Different Apostles most probably reported different appearances on different occasions. But it is, indeed, quite remarkable how similar the accounts of the Empty Tomb are in the four Gospels. There is an amazing unanimity. <br><br>The three Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) all agree on three things: one, that some women, including Mary Magdalene went to the tomb of Jesus on the first day of the week and found the stone rolled away from the tomb's entrance; two, that a young man (or some angelic presence) explained what had happened: "He is risen, he is not here"; and, three, that the women were frightened and left the tomb. Then when we look at John 20.1-2 we find that, too, fits in with this outline. The only difference there is that the angelic interpreter has not been mentioned. But two angels are mentioned in verses 11-13 when Mary is back at the tomb.<br><br>It is quite clear that the Gospel writers were drawing on different sources and different accounts of the Resurrection, but <i>these sources all agree over the Empty Tomb</i>. And, remember, Mark's Gospel is generally reckoned to be written in the sixties of the first century.  But the information he (and the others) drew on was preached, remembered and probably recorded much earlier. As late as AD 56 when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians he tells us that many of the disciples who had seen Jesus after the Resurrection "are still alive" (1 Corinthians 15.6). It is unthinkable that any eye-witnesses would have allowed an Empty Tomb tradition to develop so uniformly if it was fiction.<br><br><b>St Paul</b><br><br>But Paul, someone else says, does not mention the Empty Tomb. True, but he implies it. In 1 Corinthians 15.3-8 he speaks about the basic core of the Gospel: " ... that Christ died ... that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day ... and that he appeared (to various disciples)."<br><br>This shows us that this early "creed" focused on the burial in addition to the death of Christ. As Professor F.F.Bruce says: "Burial emphasizes the reality of the resurrection which followed, as a divine act which reversed the act of men." It points to the Empty Tomb. We have to say that what was raised was what was buried - the body of Jesus. And, note, the Resurrection was on the "third day". But what could give rise to this date? Had there been no Empty Tomb but only visionary experiences, why have such an emphasis on the "third day"? <br><br>More importantly this "basic core" or "creed" of belief made it clear that Christians believed and must believe <i>both</i> "that he was raised on the third day" <i>and</i> "that he appeared". The appearances by themselves are not gospel or good news. Some of the early disciples thought they were just having a psychical experience (Luke 24.37). But together with the Empty Tomb - a resurrection that reversed the burial - the appearances pointed to the nature of the Resurrection: it was a "bodily" resurrection. Certainly Paul presupposes "bodily change" in 1 Corinthians 15.51, "We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed." He may not explicitly have mentioned the Empty Tomb. He took it for granted, as any Jew would have done in talk of "Resurrection".<br><br>Finally, there are two questions we must ask over the Empty Tomb. First, there is a very simple question: "Why did not the Jewish authorities ever produce the remains of Christ to silence the Christian movement once and for all, if in fact Christ's body was still in the tomb or it had been removed?" The only explanation that has maintained its credibility over the centuries is that of the Resurrection. <br><br>Secondly, if the Resurrection does not encompass the transformation of the physical body, in the final analysis what do we say about this material universe? What ultimately happens to this universe of space and time? Is it all just some great mistake that God tries to forget? That was the Gnostic heresy - to say "matter is bad or mistaken". John Polkinghorne, formerly Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge, then ordained and then President of Queens' College, Cambridge, says, "No! It is not a mistake." And the key is the Empty Tomb. "The Empty Tomb," he writes, "says to me that matter has a destiny, a transformed and transmuted destiny, no doubt, but a destiny nevertheless. The material creation is not a transient, even mistaken episode." That was Paul's view. He saw Christ's Resurrection as the "first fruits". Ultimately, he said, the creative power of God will transform the whole material universe: "The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God" (Romans 8.21).<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Embryology Bill and Protesters">(April 2008) The Embryology Bill and Protesters</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2008</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>medical ethics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill</b><br><br>Why is there opposition to the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill currently going through the British Parliament? First, the Bill legislates for designer babies. It permits the manufacturing of children to use parts of their organs to treat another person – the so-called "saviour siblings". Secondly, the Bill may be emended to allow for more abortions than at present. There have been 5.3 million abortions in England and Wales since the 1967 Abortion Act. Of these only 0.4% were for the risk to the mother's life, only 1.3% for foetal handicap, but <i>98 percent were for social reasons</i>. That, it is argued, is shocking enough. Thirdly, the Bill allows for the creation of animal-human hybrids (euphemistically called "human admixed embryos"). For all the initial restraints, it is feared there will be rogue scientists at some point developing procedures whose genetic consequences could be horrific. Fourthly, human reproductive cloning in some circumstances, it is claimed, could now be argued as legal even without always destroying the embryo at 14 days. Fifthly, the Government is wanting to allow tissue from organs donated by dead people, without their consent, to be used in embryo and human hybrid embryo experimentation. Sixthly, the Bill is legislating against the importance of a father to a child's well being, in spite of the contrary evidence of the now classic <i>Families Without Fatherhood</i> and other such studies. This is to allow single women and lesbians greater access to IVF treatment. <br><br>If that is what the Government wants, what do the voters think? A recent opinion poll has revealed that there is strong opposition nationally. These are the findings: 79% of the British public think that it is important to consider a child’s need for a father when creating a child by IVF fertility treatment. 60% think that it is wrong to create animal-human embryos, while 33% do not think it is wrong and 7% do not know. 51% agree that the creation of 'saviour siblings' denies the child a choice in how its body is used while 39% disagree.<br><br><b>Easter and Bishops’ protests</b><br><br>But what do Church leaders think? Easter Day 2008 witnessed a storm of protest. Two bishops in particular spoke out. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, Cardinal O’Brien had already announced that he would be addressing issues in the Bill in his Easter Sermon. On the day he said the following:</p>

<blockquote><div>“With full might of government endorsement, Gordon Brown is promoting a Bill that will allow the creation of animal–human hybrid embryos. He is promoting a Bill which will add to the 2.2 million human embryos already destroyed or experimented upon. He is promoting a Bill allowing scientists to create babies whose sole purpose will be to provide… parts of their organs or tissues. He is promoting a Bill which will sanction the raiding of dead people’s tissue to manufacture yet more embryos for experimentation. He is promoting a Bill which denies that a child has a biological father, allows tampering with birth certificates, removing biological parents, and inserting someone altogether different. And this Bill will indeed be used to further extend the abortion laws… This Bill represents a monstrous attack on human rights, human dignity and human life. In some other European countries one could be jailed for doing what we intend to make legal.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The Archbishop recognized that many “excuses” for this legislation included the claim “that cures will soon be found for various diseases, which afflict mankind, through this legislation.” He did not, however, find this convincing as “the opposite seems to be the case, when cells required for ongoing investigation into cures through medical science can take place through cells obtained in other ways from human bodies and certainly not through the creation of animal–human embryos.” <br><br>A little further south and nearer home there was another Easter Day Sermon in Durham Cathedral by Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham. He was equally outspoken about the "current controversy about embryo cloning":</p>

<blockquote><div>Our present government has been pushing through, hard and fast, legislation that comes from a militantly atheist and secularist lobby… The media sometimes imply that it's only Roman Catholics who care about such things, but that is of course wrong. All Christians are now facing, and must resist, the long outworking of various secularist philosophies, which imagine that we can attain the Christian vision of future hope without the Christian God… Have we learnt nothing from the dark tyrannies of the last century? It shouldn't just be Roman Catholics who are objecting. It ought to be Anglicans and Presbyterians and Baptists and Russian Orthodox and Pentecostals and all other Christians and Jews and Muslims as well. This isn't a peripheral or denominational concern. It grows directly out of the central facts of our faith, because on Easter day God reaffirmed the goodness and image-bearingness of the human race in the man Jesus Christ, giving the lie simultaneously to the idea that utopia could be had by our own efforts and to the idea that humans are just miscellaneous evolutionary by-products, to be managed and manipulated at will. The Christian vision of what it means to be human is gloriously underscored by the resurrection of Jesus, and we as Easter people should make common cause with all those who are concerned about the direction our society is going in medical technology as in so much else besides.</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The key issue</b><br><br>The key issue is “how are we to think of the human embryo?” Modern innovators, however, who want to make free use of new technologies have carefully avoided this issue. The 1984 Warnock Report that set the framework for both the debate and actual practice in Britain consciously refused to address the issue of the nature of the embryo:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Although the questions of when life or personhood begin appear to be questions of fact susceptible of straightforward answers, we hold that the answers to such questions in fact are complex amalgams of factual and moral judgments. Instead of trying to answer these questions directly we have therefore gone straight to the question of how it is right to treat the human embryo.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The Church of England’s Board for Social Responsibility response in 1985 was the report <i>Personal Origins</i>. It disagreed with the Warnock Report:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Some of our contemporaries have hoped to avoid the question of the embryo’s status altogether, and have thought it possible to move directly to a purely deliberative question: how are we to act towards the early embryo? The implication of this manoeuvre would seem to be that human status is not so much discerned as conferred; that social practice is sufficient of itself to validate the claims of any pretence to humanity.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Inspite of all the protests of the Church of England, Warnock has been allowed to win the day. The result is that now, following the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act 1990 that set up the HFEA (the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority), research on human embryos up to fourteen days of life is permitted (it is to be noted that those who disagree with embryonic experiments are excluded from the HFEA). This 1990 Act has had international significance as Britain is a world-leader having carried out the first successful human <i>in vitro</i> fertilization. However, others in Europe, who are all too aware of Nazi eugenics and other medical horrors, have been banning the creation of embryos for research as the Cardinal implied.<br><br><b>The philosopher President and the new Pope.</b><br><br>An interesting coincidence occurred in May 2004. Marcello Pera, the President of the Italian Senate, a Professor of the Philosophy of Science at Pisa University and a self confessed secularist (not a Christian believer) and Joseph Ratzinger, soon to be Pope Benedict XVI, quite independently were giving lectures that included references to embryo experimentation. These have now been published together (as <i>Without Roots</i>, 2006). <br><br>Marcello Pera, in his lecture, first gave a warning regarding “new problems for which we are so unprepared”. He said that “sometimes we settle too quickly on solutions, because of philosophical or ethical hubris, petty interests, improvised conventions or premature action.” He then gave an example: “one example of such improvisation or prevarication is when one person says that an embryo or a ‘pre-embryo’ is not a person before a given date, as if the predicate ‘person’ were empirical, and could be applied on the basis of its having certain cells, rather than on the basis of what it actually is, namely, a moral and religious concept that cannot be defined in terms of experimental science alone.” He then described his personal position in these terms:</p>

<blockquote><div>“I have never believed in allowing philosophical questions to be dictated by the contingencies or conveniences of practical decisions, such as experimenting with, correcting, and manipulating embryos. This is why I believe that from a philosophical and moral point of view, we must take the position that an embryo is a person, from the moment of conception. My belief is also grounded in practical considerations. A person is not a thing. Therefore if we recognize the personhood of the embryo from its first moment, we would all become more responsible. Scientists would become more responsible when they face genetic and biological questions, since they would no longer believe that they were dealing only with questions of fact rather than also with questions of value, or claim that their discoveries in themselves represent progress, as if bonum et verum et factum convertuntur - the ‘good’, the ‘true’, and the ‘made’ are convertible – always and everywhere. Lawmakers would also become more responsible; when they try to get the green light for this or that congressional bill, they would have to do a better, more accurate job of weighing the ethical reasons on one side of the balance against the practical, scientific, social, and economic issues on the other. Health workers would also become more responsible; when they act they would be less inclined to experiment, dare, and light heartedly believe that if something is possible scientifically then it is allowed in practice, so long as you have the instruments and means. Finally, the patients of biomedical technologies and all citizens would become more responsible; everybody would be less propelled to second their desires, transform them into needs, consider them values, and construe them as rights.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The new Pope then argued in his lecture for the mainstream Christian position and why it recognizes a “person from the moment of conception.” His argument was that according to what is now common knowledge with regard to the embryo, “from the first instant [<i>of conception</i>], the program is fixed as to what this living being will be: a man, this individual-man with his characteristic aspects already well determined. In other words, in the zygote resulting from fertilization the biological identity of a new human individual is already constituted.” He argued that this is not philosophical but scientific fact and added: “one can verify empirically that there is a new individual: ‘individual’ is an empirical term since it refers to an organism that, while being completely dependent on the mother, is nevertheless a new organism with its own genetic program.” He then asked, for him, the important question:</p>

<blockquote><div>“‘How can a human individual not be a human person?’ From this derives the ethical deduction, ‘The human being must be respected (as a person) from the very first instance of his [or her] existence’… From this derives, on the other hand, a deduction for the legislator. If this is the way things are, then the authorization to kill the embryo means that ‘The state is denying the equality of all before the law.’ For us the question of the right of life for all those who are human beings is not a question of the ethics of faith, but rather of the ethics of reason. It is at this level that the debate should take place.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The Bible and the Christian tradition</b><br><br>The background to the Christian tradition is that abortion was common in the ancient world. That is why in ancient Greece the Hippocratic Oath for doctors was: “I will not give a pessary to a woman to cause abortion.” Abortion was also common in the Roman Empire by the time of Christ. The coming of Christ and the spread of the Christian faith, however, brought a challenge to this practice of abortion. In the period immediately following that of the Apostles - the period of the Church Fathers - one of the distinctives that marked the Church off from the pagan world was its opposition to abortion. This was a fruit of the gospel - the extension of care to the humblest of human beings, including human embryonic and foetal life. Early canon law, and subsequent pronouncements, have in general defended life in the womb as “human” or “human on the way” and so as worthy of Christian love and protection. More recently, however, an ethic of “justifiable foeticide” has evolved. This, too, claims a Christian basis, namely that human life itself does not have an absolute value, only a very high one. There may therefore be occasions when life can be taken or protection withdrawn. But such a serious action has to be justified. As with the “just war”, the right to act cannot be presumed. It has to be argued for. Most would agree that a serious threat to the actual life of the mother is a justifying reason. Some argue that some congenital deformity is a justifying reason (some would say that this has to be such that no life outside the womb can be maintained). But these and other difficult cases are very rare. As we have seen, <i>98 percent of abortions in Britain are for social reasons</i>. <br><br>But is it, in fact, <i>innocent</i> life that is being taken? Is actual <i>human</i> life being destroyed in abortion or in embryo research? And why should conception be so important? What does the Bible say? Exodus 21:22 refers to an injury to a pregnant woman. If she miscarries, the claims of the foetus are assessed as less than her own. But violence to the foetus is still an offence. Mostly, however, the Bible speaks at a more general level. Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, “As you do not know... how the body is formed in a mother’s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.” That suggests there should be a certain agnosticism, or at least humility, in our thinking about antenatal life. We are not facing a blob of tissue, but a divine mystery; something we cannot understand fully. But agnosticism here means, surely, we ought to protect the child from conception onwards. If you discover someone knocked down in the road, you should not say, “I wonder if he is dead or not? I do not know, so I'll leave him.” Rather you should presume life and seek help. <br><br>The basic philosophical question, however, is this: “Whose is the history of that which is in the womb - the mother's or a separate person's?” The Psalmist had no doubt. It was <i>his</i> history. <i>He</i> was in the womb: “For you created <i>my</i> inmost being; you knit <i>me</i> together in <i>my</i> mother’s womb” (Psalm 139:13). Isaiah said much the same thing: “<i>Before I was born</i> the LORD called <i>me</i>; from my birth he has made mention of my name” (Isaiah 49:1). Most importantly, this is also the Christian understanding from the New Testament stories of the birth of Jesus. The incarnation of the Son of God began not with his birth but with his <i>conception</i>. So we say in the Creed: “<i>He</i> was conceived...” In so far as Jesus Christ reveals true man (as well as true God), the inescapable conclusion is that life in the womb is human from conception. It is interesting to note the use of the Greek word <i>brephos</i> that means “child” in Luke 1:41. “The child leaped in her womb”. That is the same word as is used for a child <i>after birth</i>. And, more than leaping in her womb, the child apparently was filled with the Holy Spirit. Elizabeth spoke of the pregnant Mary as the “mother of my Lord”.<br><br><b>Human in What Way?</b><br><br>The fundamental Christian belief is in a God who gives, a God of “grace”. He “gave” his only Son for our sins (John 3:16). And human life is a “gift”. When Job was bereaved he said, “The Lord <i>gave</i> and the Lord has taken away” (Job 1:21). Human life is “given”; it is not “achieved”. That is important. We do not “achieve” our humanity by reaching certain standards of performance or development. Nonetheless, in the debate on embryo experimentation many assume today that the word “human” (and so the offer of protection) is to be applied only where there are certain “achievements”. These are in terms of physical performance or psychological or mental development. This, however, is a totalitarian road. Also it can go on to exclude from the category of the “human” also certain physical or racial “under-achievements”. So, for example, Peter Singer, the Princeton Professor of Bioethics, and many others say that disabled babies (and not just profoundly disabled) can be dispensed with <i>after birth</i>. This is the reintroduction of infanticide. It is already happening in Holland along with other forms of euthanasia.<br><br>If humanity is a “gift”, the first 14 days surely cannot be discounted as a period of “nonbeing”, any more than other periods of a person's life. Behind human procreation is the divine creation. Procreation is creation on behalf of God (“pro” being Latin for “on behalf of”). Protection is to be offered to human beings not because they “reach a certain stage of development” but because of the fact that they are all created by God <i>in his image</i>. “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man” (Genesis 9:6). <br><br>So in saying that the embryo is “human”, we are saying that in virtue of its genotype or genetic code it is a distinct being that has been <i>pro</i>created. It may be that God's creative powers, entrusted to men and women, have been misused (even by medical scientists), but that is not a ground for destroying what has been created. And what is created is a human embryo. It is not a human 10 week foetus, nor a human infant, nor a human adolescent, nor a human adult, nor a senile human being. If a senile person is a degenerating member of humanity, an embryo is a developing member. Nor is the embryo just “potentially” human. Yes, it only potentially has the characteristics it will develop in later life. The new born baby only potentially has the characteristics it will develop as a toddler or teenager. A human embryo can be thought of as “human with potential”. An ovum or sperm - i.e. prior to conception - is “potentially human”. Nor should we moralize according to size and so the minuteness of an embryo (the world looks microscopic from the perspective of an astronaut). Nor should we be impressed by the natural loss of many early embryos (earthquakes happening do not mean massacres are justified), nor by the problem of subsequent twinning (a flat worm does not cease to be a worm because it can form itself into two), nor by the significance of implantation (that is not a matter of identity but of environment). Surely it is, therefore, most reasonable to say that the boundaries of human life are conception and death.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>There are many other problems to consider, including the guilt felt by those involved in embryo experimentation or abortion. Christians, therefore, must not only teach what is right. They must also teach the good news of Good Friday and forgiveness at the Cross of Calvary, where Christ bore every kind of sin including sins in this not so <i>Brave New World</i>. Some reading this may be scarred from their own experiences. The gospel, of course, is that Christ loves the sinner and forgives, but he hates the sin and says: “Go and sin no more.”  Of course, we need to thank God for modern biotechnology. The Bible teaches that we have permission to “subdue” the earth and “rule”. <i>But</i> there are also limits. According to Genesis to ignore those limits spells disaster (Genesis 1:28, 2:17).<br><br>(See also the sermons at www.church.org.uk 07/08/2005am and 14/08/2005pm and “Cloning Humans” at www.clayton.tv.)<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Ascension of Jesus Christ">(May 2008) The Ascension of Jesus Christ</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2008</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Doubts and denials</b><br><br>The leadership in Protestant churches in the last half of the 20th century reflected the theological liberalism of the first half of the century. This led to doubts and denials of basic biblical truth. For example, in 1963 a book was published by the then Bishop of Woolwich, entitled Honest to God. Chapter 1 started off by seeming to deny the Ascension: </p>

<blockquote><div>Even such an educated man as St Luke can express the conviction of Christ's ascension - the conviction that he is not merely alive but reigns in the might and right of God - in the crudest of terms of being 'lifted' up into heaven, there to sit down at the right hand of the Most High" (Acts 1.9-11).</div></blockquote>

<p>Twenty years later in 1984 the then Bishop of Durham publicly cast doubt on the empty tomb of Jesus and even referred to "conjuring tricks with bones". However, in the successful defence of the Resurrection, Christians have sometimes ignored the Ascension of Jesus and its denials. But the arguments of the late Bishop Woolwich were wrong. <br><br>The New Testament writers were aware of figurative speech as much as we are. The "parables", after all, were the stuff of Jesus teaching. Nor is there real evidence in the New Testament of belief in a crude three-decker universe. Such comments on the physical universe as we have do not imply a belief in a structured spatial universe in which "heaven" is one part of space. In the Jewish intertestamental literature as indeed in Gnostic literature you had some such ideas. But in the New Testament there is an absence of cosmological geography. In the book of Revelation at the end of the seven letters to the churches you read: "there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, 'Come up here ... ' At once I was in the Spirit and there before me was a throne" (Rev 4.1-2). There 'was no journeying. It was, for the writer, life in an immediate, new, spiritual order. Certainly the early Christian Fathers after the Apostolic age had no illusions. Augustine of Hippo was clear. Writing of the fact that "Christ is seated at God's right hand," he says with regard to the word "sitting": "the expression indicates not a posture of the members, but judicial power, which the majesty never fails to possess." <br><br>Modern man has not been the first to discover the power and value of metaphors or figurative language. Most use spatial language metaphorically to suggest value. We regularly use metaphors of space to indicate superior or inferior position. We say, "prices are up and wages are down." In football you are in the "top half" or, if you are Newcastle United or Sunderland, in the "bottom half" of the Premier League. Need I say more?<br><br><b>The Ascension</b><br><br>The early Christians, of course, did not only believe in the death and Resurrection of Jesus. As they said (and we today say) in the Apostles’ Creed: "I believe ... he [Jesus Christ] ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father." The Resurrection was wonderful. It made it clear that Christ was victorious over sin and death following his crucifixion. But even more good news is that Christ is now truly reigning and in control of everything in heaven and on earth. That is the message of the Ascension and his Session (or his being seated at the right hand of God the Father). The writer to the Hebrews, therefore, tells us to ... </p>

<blockquote><div>fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb 12.2).</div></blockquote>

<p>The Ascension was the last parting of the risen Christ from his disciples who had seen him alive after the Resurrection. The difference this time was in the nature of the parting. The previous description of such a parting in Luke’s Gospel seems instantaneous (Luke 24.31). At the Ascension Jesus parted "before their very eyes" (literally "with them looking"). The process could be observed to a certain point. A cloud came down, probably as at the Transfiguration of Jesus. That was when, together with Peter, John and James, "a cloud [which had signified in the Old Testament the divine presence] appeared and enveloped them" (Luke 9.34). So now Jesus was drawn up into the cloud and the cloud did rise. However, while the other separations of the risen Jesus from his disciples were for a few hours or days only, this was truly final. There would be no new appearances (or none of the same kind). Never again was Jesus to be with his disciples in such a way that they could even eat with, drink with and touch him. He was to be made real now by the Holy Spirit. For this was a withdrawal of Jesus from the whole order of existence that we experience this side of the grave. It completed for Jesus that process of change from this current limited and finite state that began with his Resurrection. Jesus was, indeed, returning to his Father: "I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" (John 20.17). J.I.Packer says this: "withdrawal had to take place somehow and going up, down or sideways, failing to appear or suddenly vanishing were the only possible ways. Which would signify most clearly that Jesus would henceforth be reigning in glory? That answers itself."<br><br>Jesus Christ, therefore, returned to his Father not in the same way as he came. He returned as the "Word" having been "made flesh" - for ever united with human nature. But the Resurrection had so affected the physical side of Christ's human nature that his body, as recorded in the Gospels, was (even before the Ascension) independent of what we would call "the laws of nature". Now with his fully glorified body we may assume the change is complete.<br><br><b>The Session</b><br><br>The Session - "being seated at God's right hand" - began with the Ascension and is the true and ultimate fulfilment of Psalm 110, the most quoted part of the Old Testament in the New Testament: "The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet" (Psalm 110.1). Jesus had this Psalm in mind during the last week of his earthly ministry (Mark 12.36). The early Apostles saw its fulfilment in the Ascension. This comes out in Peter's Pentecost Sermon: "Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear" (Acts 2.33). <br><br>But that Psalm 110 also talks of a "priest forever": "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek'" (verse 4). The New Testament writers saw Christ's session, involving a present priestly role, as so vital. Paul says in Romans 8.34: "Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life - is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." That means Christ, God the Son, is working with God the Father in our interest. He is the guarantor that what he died to secure for us will be ours. And Christ prays not as we do, often with a sense of uncertainty as to whether prayer will be positively answered. For he now has all "authority in heaven" (Matt 28.18). What he prays for is done! Jesus' "high priesthood" also encourages us to pray, with all our weaknesses:</p>

<blockquote><div>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are - yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need" (Hebrews 4.15-16).</div></blockquote>

<p>Finally, the use of Psalm 110 by the Apostles invites us to see Jesus Christ now as truly victorious, being "high over" everything in our universe of space and time and in the realm of an eternity that is far beyond our weakest imaginings. In the ancient world, being at the right hand meant, of course, being the chief executive of the King or Emperor. Undoubtedly there is symbolic and metaphorical language being used, but in the words of H.B.Swete:</p>

<blockquote><div>the exaltation and glorification of the sacred manhood of our Lord, the exercise by him of all authority in heaven and on earth, the certainty of his final triumph over sin and death, are facts and the most potent facts in the life of the human race.</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Christ the King</b><br><br>The throne imagery implies kingship. Jesus Christ is now "crowned":<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone" (Heb 2.9).</div></blockquote>

<p> In the Parable of the Ten Minas Jesus suggested his Ascension was like being "appointed king" (Luke 19.12). Jesus told Pilate that he was "a king" (John 18.37) but that his kingdom was "from another place". The early Christians were accused by their opponents of saying "there is another king, one called Jesus" (Acts 17.7).<br><br>As persecution increased, or was likely to increase, the more it seems believers were to focus on "the Power and Empire of Christ our Redeemer" (to quote the words of the UK Coronation Service). The book of Revelation speaks of the Ascended Christ as "the ruler of the kings of the earth" (Rev 1.5). We are also told that "on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords" (Rev 19.16). So when, according to Suetonius, the Emperor Domitian at Rome was wanting to be called "our Lord and God" (Dominus et Deus noster), it was clear the early church had to proclaim that the Ascended Christ was over any blasphemous Emperor. But were these statements of Christ’s kingship the hollow claims made by men and women driven to despair? "No!" said these early Christians. "For Christ exercises a real kingship at the present time in spite of all the suffering." They knew that just before his Ascension Jesus had made that amazing claim: "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matt 28.18).<br><br>Christ had exercised "authority" in his earlier ministry (with authority being not only the right to act but also having the necessary power). He revealed his authority to forgive sins by healing the paralytic man (Mark 2.10). He was seen to teach "with authority" (Matt 7.29). He had authority over the demonic (Mark 1.27). He delegated authority to his Apostles (Mark 6.7). And he had spiritual authority to "give eternal life" (John 17.2). What was new now was that the whole creation came within the scope of Christ's authority and power. All these previous claims to authority fall significantly short of this claim to have "all authority in heaven and on earth."<br><br><b>All authority in heaven</b><br><br>Paul writes about this heavenly authority in Ephesians 1.20-22 where Christ is said now to be raised from the dead and seated at the right hand of the Father ...</p>

<blockquote><div>... in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church" (Eph 1.20-22).</div></blockquote>

<p> Whatever these spiritual or eternal realities are, Christ is above them and "far above" them. Christ has a position that has no parallel in heaven. He is not the best of any angelic beings. He is the supreme Son sharing the Father's throne. So the Philippians were told (Phil 2.9-11):</p>

<blockquote><div>Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</div></blockquote>

<p> And "Lord" can stand for the divine name. So in heaven the Ascended Christ is praised by "thousands upon thousands" of worshipping angels:</p>

<blockquote><div>Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. In a loud voice they sang: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!" (Rev 5.11-12).</div></blockquote>

<p> The Ascended Christ is also Lord over evil spiritual forces. The early Christians could say, as we can and must:</p>

<blockquote><div>our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Eph 6.12).</div></blockquote>

<p> Christ, however, has ultimate authority over those forces. As yet the Devil is not finally defeated. He is "down" but not "out". One day he will be defeated. Revelation 20 speaks of "the devil ... thrown into the lake of burning sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever." This, too, is beyond imagining in its fearfulness. It is a warning for us of the utter seriousness of evil; but a hope that one day it will be no more. As yet these evil spiritual forces are not fully "under Christ's feet". The struggle goes on. But Christ is the ultimate victor.<br><br><b>All authority on earth</b><br><br>What, then, does it mean to say that the Ascended Christ has all authority on earth? We learn that "the Son" of God is the one by whom ...</p>

<blockquote><div>all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. He is before all things" (Col 1.16).</div></blockquote>

<p> But now "in him all things hold together" (Col 1.17); and "the Son," says Hebrews 1.3, is "sustaining all things by his powerful word." That is not like Atlas of mythology taking the dead weight of the world on his shoulders. No! Rather the Ascended Christ is able to be a living dynamic immanent within the created universe. In his earthly ministry Christ had a unique power over nature. He did among people "what no one else did" (John 15.24). Ascended there would seem to be no limit, now that his manhood is glorified.<br><br>The New Testament sees the Ascended Christ as a fulfilment of Psalm 8. He is the true fulfiller of human destiny. "Man" was "made a little lower than the angels" and everything was intended to be "subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him. But we see Jesus [the exception], who was made a little lower than the angels [at his birth], now crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death, so that by the grace of  God he might taste death for everyone" (Heb 2.7-9). We should never be surprised by the rise of modern science and human power. But in Jesus we can now see far more than the fulfilment of all that was intended for humankind (had it not been corrupted by human sin).<br><br>Not only physical nature but also rebellious human nature is subject to the Ascended Christ’s authority on earth. In addition to Psalms 110 and Psalm 8, Psalm 2 was important for the early Christians. When they were first attacked by the religious authorities - "the rulers, elders and teachers of the law" (Acts 4.5) - they immediately thought of Psalm 2 and the words of ... </p>

<blockquote><div>... our father David: 'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One'" (Acts 4.25-26).</div></blockquote>

<p> Psalm 2 had spoken of "the Son" having "the nations" as an "inheritance": "you will rule them with an iron sceptre; you will dash them to pieces like pottery" (verse 9). So to the Church at Thyatira, in the book of Revelation, the risen and ascended Christ says: </p>

<blockquote><div>To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations - 'He will rule them with an iron sceptre; he will dash them to pieces like pottery' - just as I have received authority from my Father" (Rev 2.26-27).</div></blockquote>

<p> That was said to a church not suffering persecution but to a church, like churches today, being corrupted by a false prophetess (an ancient equivalent of the American Bishop Gene Robinson, currently doing the rounds of the British media, having left his wife and children to live with his male partner). "By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality" (Rev 2.20). There is no suggestion that this side of Christ's return, any violence should be used by the Church. The iron sceptre was thought to be an iron tipped rod used by shepherds (forcefully) to direct their sheep. However, the prayer of the early Christians in Acts 4 was not for any "shattering" but that the Lord would enable his "servants to speak your word with great boldness" and that God would heal and perform miracles (Acts 4.29-30). That was their exercise of power!<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>But this current reign of the Ascended Christ has a time limit:</p>

<blockquote><div>then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For he 'has put everything under his feet. ' Now when it says that 'everything' has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all" (1 Cor 15.24-28).</div></blockquote>

<p> The kingdom that "Christ hands over" is to be absorbed in that greater kingdom the Son has with the Father that "will never end" (Luke 1.33; Heb 1.8). Then, indeed, the triune God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) will be all in all. Until then, in this current phase caused by the reality of supernatural and human sinfulness, Jesus Christ ascended and reigning is our king and high priest; "the Lamb on the Throne"; and the one to whom we should look for guidance, help, correction, forgiveness and ultimate restoration. Colossians 3.1-3 says:</p>

<blockquote><div>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.</div></blockquote>

<p>Therefore, we should pray the Collect for Ascension Day:</p>

<blockquote><div>Almighty God, as we believe your only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended into the heavens, so may we also in heart and mind thither ascend and with him continually dwell; who is alive and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Northern Daily Express (15 January 1861) and Bishop Henry Villiers">(June 2008) Northern Daily Express (15 January 1861) and Bishop Henry Villiers</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2008</li><li>Church History and Future</li><li>JPC</li><li>Richard Clayton</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>While recently sorting papers, I came across the 15 January 1861 edition of the Northern Daily Express. It contained, one, an editorial on the background to the founding of "Jesmond Church" (Jesmond Parish Church’s official name) that was built in memory of Richard Clayton, the great 19th century Tyneside evangelical leader; two, a report on the consecration of the new building that took place the day before (14 January 1861); and, three, a transcript of the consecration sermon preached by Henry Villiers, the then Bishop of Durham (before Newcastle Diocese was formed, Jesmond was in Durham Diocese).<br><br>This sermon is printed out below and with no alteration. It is important for three reasons. First, it reveals how far the Church of England has drifted since those days. For we may doubt that many bishops today in England in 2008 would preach like Henry Villiers. But, secondly, we need to remember that 100 years before Henry Villiers few bishops would have preached like he did. So change can happen. In the 18th century another Bishop of Durham, Joseph Butler, complained that "it is … taken for granted by many persons that Christianity is … fictitious; and … a principal subject of mirth and ridicule … for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the world." Then came the evangelical revival of the second half of the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries and in which Richard Clayton played a part. Many Anglican leaders are now praying and working for a similar turn around. Thirdly, what the bishop said then needs to be heard again today. So much by way of introduction. Now for the sermon. The bishop took for his text Romans 14.17: "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."<br><br><b>The consecration sermon</b><br><br>Brethren, the prophet uttered very solemn words when he said, "Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for ever?" These words occurred to my own mind very forcibly as I was considering the duty which was laid upon me of addressing you today. <br><br>It must be a solemn moment for us all, if we think of what may be the results of consecrating a place of worship to the service of Almighty God. From this place there might sound forth sound truth. But who can venture to say what may be the result of the services within these walls? We must wait for eternity to reveal to whom they shall prove "the savour of life unto life" or of "death unto death." <br><br>But if such a solemnity as this in which we are engaged today must tend, I should think, to make every man (that may be here present) thoughtful, how much more, how very much more solemn must this service be to the minds of many of my present hearers, when we recollect that this church has been raised as a special memorial to one from whose lips many a soul here has received "the truth as it is in Jesus." <br><br><b>God's use of pastors like Richard Clayton</b><br><br>Brethren, I know something of a pastor's life. I know something of what it is to be permitted, under God, to see souls awakened, souls delivered from the power of Satan, souls brought into the kingdom of God. I know something of the closeness of union made between the sinner saved and the poor instrument that God has vouchsafed to make use of in the conversion of these souls. I know, therefore, well what the minister feels for his own particular flock, and it leads me pretty well to judge (it enables me with pretty fair accuracy to tell) what is the feeling of the people before me today. <br><br>The language of St. Paul when he writes to the church of the Thessalonians is that which describes the feeling of the minister as he labours amongst his people: "What is our joy, or hope, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye?" The minister thus feels for his people. But it is inseparable from union with his flock, "… even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming. For ye are our glory and joy." And I am sure that this feeling is no one-sided feeling. There is a reciprocal feeling on the part of the people; and these walls confirm that feeling. Don't doubt that there are many here who look back to the time when they were in darkness and God brought them into His "marvellous light" by the instrumentality of him to whose memory this church is erected [Richard Clayton]. <br><br>It is under this conviction that I am sure your prayers will be sincere this day, that while by a legal act I set apart this place for the service of God, by the blessing (the covenant blessing) of our God this place will indeed be set apart for the pure, simple declaration of God's own Word to the conversion of many souls to be heirs of God and joint-heirs with the Lord Jesus for ever. <br><br><b>The Kingdom of God</b><br><br>Brethren, let me then, today, in addressing you endeavour to lead your thoughts onwards. Let me endeavour to lead you to the consideration of that Kingdom of God, and very briefly into the means by which that Kingdom may be reached. <br><br>Now, the text (you see) sets before us, under the title of the Kingdom of God, vital piety. I ask you to notice that expression for I use it advisedly; for any other piety is plausible impiety. It is worse! For that which looks like piety and is impiety, is that which lulls to sleep the poor sinner and prepares his soul for the nethermost hell. <br><br>That Kingdom of God to which the Apostle refers clearly does not mean the Kingdom of Glory, but is that which leads to the Kingdom of Glory. It is put before you in two points of view – negatively and positively. Negatively – for we are told it is not meat and drink. Depend upon it, real religion is something more than fasting and feasting. It is not whether a man eats or whether he does not. As the Apostle says in this Epistle to the Romans, "Meat commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat are we the better; neither if we eat not are we the worse." No, nor is it in any outward form whatsoever that piety consists. Under the outward form there may be real piety (and I think there is very little piety without outward form). But it is not the outward form. St. Paul teaches that "bodily exercise profiteth little." But, positively – for I leave this – it is "righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." <br><br><b>Righteousness</b><br><br>Now, by righteousness here is intended that inwrought righteousness, not the imputed righteousness of Christ. That which gives us a title to Heaven is the imputed righteousness of Christ. But this refers to the inwrought righteousness, the work of the Holy Ghost, that which is the effect (call it by what name you please – the effect) of real conversion. <br><br>And, brethren, it is very necessary to understand that all are not Israel who are of Israel; that all are not Christians who are called Christians; that there is the conversion of the heart; and that, except you are converted, you shall never enter the Kingdom of Heaven; but that, where conversion exists, it is not that fluctuation state by which many may be a child of God today and a child of the devil tomorrow. But real conversion of the heart is where the grace of God dwells in the heart – where there will be the fruits of the Spirit of God. <br><br>And I may well, therefore, say to any who doubt this statement (if there be any who doubt it, if there be any who have not searched there minds), let them say [by way of reminder], "Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works." This is St. James's testimony. He has left us this, and it is well that we should look to it. There would not be so many Pharisees, there would not be so many contented with a "name to live", there would not be so many mere formalists, if they would look within as well as without, and seek for the inwrought righteousness, the work of the Spirit of the living God. <br><br><b>Peace</b><br><br>Then the text speaks of peace - that peace which comes not from leaving a man asleep in his sins; not from shrinking to tell him that he is by nature born in sin and a child of wrath and that he must be born again; not a peace that consists with letting a man go quietly in the world, and out of the world, without his conscience ever having been touched at all; but that peace which is produced by the blood – the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. "When I see the blood," said the Lord, "I will pass over." "Without the shedding of blood there can be no remission." Without that blood of sprinkling being applied to your conscience and mine, there never can be peace for either of us. <br><br>After the peace of the Holy Ghost comes to the spirit of man (that is, the Spirit of the living God who takes the things of Christ and shows them unto us) it is no mere question of frames and feelings but of scriptural truth that we must have this interest in Christ. And when this is the case, we can apply the words of the Apostle, "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." But when there is this peace in the Holy Ghost, there will be peace of conscience -  the Spirit of God bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. <br><br>Brethren, this is a part of real religion that we should constantly aim at – the inward witness of the Spirit. We should seek to have this unction from the Holy One. There it may be found where the Spirit is working, where there is inwrought righteousness – not empty profession but the Spirit working in us giving us views of Christ and our interest in Him. <br><br><b>Joy</b><br><br>So the text speaks of "joy in the Holy Ghost." Don't separate the terms. It is not the condition, therefore, of men who have mere confidence in the flesh. How strongly St. Paul dwells on this in his Epistle to the Philippians: "We are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh, though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more." <br><br>He then goes through a variety of external privileges, "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ." He was brought to this feeling, to which we must be brought (if Christians, in deed and in truth): Christ is all – not an empty name, not a profession, not a mere fancy or expectation, but what the Scripture tells me Christ is and Christ has done. "On thee, O Lord, do I hope." "Truly my hope is in Thee." This must be my joy. And then truly we shall indeed have joy in the Holy Ghost; for it will be a blessed state in the midst of the sorrows of this life, yet to see our interest in Christ. <br><br>The minister parts with his people as he stands by their dying beds, knowing their interest in Christ. They will not return to him, but he will go to them. And the people, too, can think of the minister that has been called from them to enter into his rest; and they can look to the time when the Lord shall come and bring his saints with Him and say, "I shall see him to whom through God I have been indebted for my hopes of eternal life." <br><br><b>Holiness</b><br><br>But I would pass on to inquire how this state may be attained. We are bidden to follow after holiness "without which no man shall see the Lord." How, then, are we to attain this blessing? Now, brethren, I am convinced it can never be by cowardice; it can be by the compromise of no religious principle whatever. God never calls upon us to exercise a spurious charity, which is near akin to infidelity. <br><br>Now, there are many who seem to wish to live well with all and, therefore, they will say it is well with all, whereas the Bible clearly tells us there is a difference; and to the Christian, says the Apostle, "Come out and be separate." The Christian is taught to bear in mind that he is of God and, therefore, he will allow no false modesty, no pretence of having more charity (than the Bible warrants) to hide the truth. We are either of God or not of God. There are two classes; and, therefore, if the Kingdom of God is to be within you - a "kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost" –  there must be a difference. <br><br><b>The Word of God – the Bible</b><br><br>Under this sentiment, and under a conviction of the scriptural truth of this sentiment, I would say to you in the first place, "Take head what ye hear; and take heed how ye hear." "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." Never suffer yourselves to be led astray from the Word of God. Our Church [of England] refers all to the Word of God. Her [Thirty-nine] Articles tell you nothing is to be required except that which is to be proved by the Word of God. Every service calls clearly on the minister to search everything by the Word. The greatest praise of the Bereans was that they "searched the Scriptures whether these things were so". <br><br>So, brethren, let that to which you listen be according to the Word of God.  Take heed what you hear. Compromise no principle; compromise no truth. Truth is one. The Bible contains that which makes you free. But take heed how you hear! If you mean to receive that which is able to make you wise unto salvation, don't come with a cavilling spirit. Don't come trying to find fault, trying to settle whether this is according to a preconceived notion or not. You will never profit in that way. <br><br>When men wish to be many masters, I strongly suspect that their hearing of the Word will be much more likely to feed that feeling, rather than that humbleness which becomes the Christian. Search the Scriptures, but if you do find your preconceived notion is opposed, if you find some fancy that you have adopted - some shibboleth that is meeting your ear from hour to hour - take heed that what you hear is according to the Word; and finding that, let God be true. There is a beautiful pattern for a congregation given in the tenth chapter of the Acts. If you take the 33rd verse, you find one of the congregation [Cornelius] stood up and said, "Now, therefore, are we all here present before God, to hear all things which are commanded thee [Peter, the preacher] of God." <br><br><b>Prayer</b><br><br>But, secondly, hearing is not enough; there should be prayer. You may receive the Gospel, but there should be prayer for your own souls (the preparation of which is from the Lord) that you may be prepared by the Holy Spirit to receive the Gospel. <br>Yes, and I will tell you another thing which I believe many persons overlook; and while they find fault with the minister, it is only putting the blame on the wrong shoulder. There should be in the congregation prayer for the minister. If congregations prayed more for him who is to speak, the minister would have more success; if they were praying for the Spirit, the minister would soon show that God, with His Spirit and blessing, was present. And seeing you know something of the blessing of the minister to yourself, let me suggest that you be often in prayer, not only that God may be present in this house, but that His Spirit may be on your minister in his chamber [or study] preparing him for the service of the sanctuary. <br><br><b>Personal Religion</b><br><br>The Word and prayer I have spoken of. But let me press upon you, thirdly, not to content yourselves with religion as a theory, but seek to have religion personally applied to your hearts – that is, not to have only a general notion of Christ, but to have a personal application of Christ to your own hearts. Seek to know your own interest in Him, so that you can say, "I know in whom I have believed." Then, brethren, you may help one another, as you are now forming yourselves into a new congregation. Help one another by seeking mutual edification, attending to this in your societies wherever you can, in your congregational means, in your classes, in your Scripture readings, in your schools. <br><br>If I mistake not, that which I am saying to you at this time, is in exact conformity with the instructions which have fallen from the lips of that honoured servant of God to whose memory this place has been erected. I have endeavoured to find (for it was not my privilege to be personally acquainted with him) - I have endeavoured to find if there were any particulars of his ministerial life to which I might refer. <br><br><b>Moral concern, missionary zeal and evangelical truth</b><br><br>Such particulars have been given to me, from which I have extracted these few words:<br><br>"The discourses of Mr Clayton were characterised by a clear exhibition of evangelical views, and by their practical tendency. His position in society might have tempted him to spare the vices of fashionable life; but no one could be found more bold and forward than he in the denunciation of what he conceived to be sinful conformity to the world" (Leading article in the Northern Daily Express, 9 Oct 1856). <br><br>I have been told by those who were members of his flock, that his congregation had always been marked for their zealous support of missions and of every benevolent object. God grant that, while he is now dead, he may yet speak; that those words which have fallen from his lips from time to time may again recur to your hearts; and that from this place there may always be found the same evangelical truth, the same zeal for missions (whether at home or abroad) and for every charitable enterprise – on the part of this congregation. <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>One word more. No one can more heartily sympathise with you in seeing this church raised for such an object than I do. I thank God for it, and pray for His blessing. But, be on your guard! Don't mistake. Be true to yourselves and your religious principles; let there be no compromise of those principles. But, don't mistake: the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. <br><br>In him [Richard Clayton] there was a willingness to acknowledge the love of Christ, wherever the love of Christ exists. And, if all may not use the same words, yet [ask] is there the same inwrought righteousness? Is there a peace secured on the same foundation? Is there the same joy in the Holy Ghost? Is there the kingdom of God? <br><br>Don't try, therefore, and let this be, as it were, the cause of inflaming bad passions; let it rather be the place of cultivating Christian love – Christian forbearance, Christian zeal and Christian earnestness – with a desire to make known the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br><br>Do these things, and there will be indeed a memorial, not a mere material memorial, but a spiritual memorial raised, one that will show that while he is gone he has left his loving principles here, desiring to see those who were his people growing in grace and knowledge, growing in conformity to the image of God's dear Son.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="GAFCON, The Future and The 'Statement"">(August 2008) GAFCON, The Future and The "Statement"</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2008</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li><li>homosexuality</li><li>Church of England</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>GAFCON and its history<br><br>The Global Anglican Future CONference held in Jerusalem at the end of June 2008 occurred not to stop a split in the Anglican Communion but because there already exists such a  split. That is a sad but hard fact. The presenting problem is homosexual relationships, with things coming to a head in 2003 in the United States with the consecration as bishop of New Hampshire of a partnered homosexual, Gene Robinson. Since the 1970s and the “Gay Liberation” movement the Western Churches have tried to pretend the “gay agenda” is not a problem. The leadership has wanted this to be considered a secondary issue over which there is liberty to disagree. The majority of Christians, however, think otherwise. Votes in the Church of England’s General Synod in 1987 and the Lambeth Conference in 1998 made this crystal clear. A significant number of bishops, however, ignored these resolutions. <br><br>In 2002 Rowan Williams was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. Rowan Williams had publicly admitted to ordaining a man he knew had a homosexual partner and acknowledged “that ‘conforming your life ... to Christ’ doesn’t necessarily mean giving up a homosexual lifestyle.” Before his appointment was official, therefore, some of us, incumbents of larger Anglican churches, felt obliged to write to the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, registering our opposition. We said: <br><br>“such actions and views [as those above] fly in the face of the clear teaching of the Holy Scriptures and the resolutions of the Lambeth Conference 1998. Rowan Williams would not have the confidence of the vast majority of Anglicans in the world, who are now in the third world and who, as loyal Anglicans, take the Holy Scriptures as their supreme authority. His appointment would lead to a major split in the Anglican Communion (including the Church of England).”<br><br>Sadly we have been proved correct. <br><br>The last straw<br><br>In the summer of 2003 Rowan Williams, at the start, approved the appointment of a partnered homosexual as the new Bishop of Reading. Fortunately Jeffrey John, the man concerned, offered his resignation after Oxford clergy had vigorously protested. Then came the autumn of 2003. Rowan Williams now found himself presiding at a meeting of Primates (senior archbishops from around the world) at Lambeth. The meeting was over the proposed consecration of Gene Robinson [already referred to] and it warned: <br><br>“If his consecration proceeds ... many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of Communion with the Episcopal Church (USA). This will tear the fabric of our Communion at its deepest level, and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in Communion with provinces that choose not to break Communion with the Episcopal Church (USA).”<br><br>The consecration, however, went ahead. Discussion after discussion was held to resolve problems that followed. But little was changed. Indeed, discussion without discipline means more and more church gay activity with impunity. In England, for example, bishops were soon equivocating over homosexual Civil Partnerships (virtual “gay marriage”) with one of the first, if not the first of these, taking place in our own parish of Jesmond at the Newcastle Civic Centre. A clergyman from the Durham diocese was there registering his relationship with his male lover in December 2005. A service followed in St Thomas’ Haymarket at which the former Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, preached and a former suffragan bishop of Durham was present. The clergyman involved has now retired from Durham diocese. But he is living in retirement in Newcastle and with Permission to Officiate (as a clergyman in the Newcastle diocese) granted by the Bishop of Newcastle. <br><br>The last straw for the GAFCON Primates, however, was in February 2007. At the main Primates meeting in Tanzania it was decided that the Episcopal Church of America should be given just one last chance to repent of its support for the gay agenda and being complicit in the consecration of Gene Robinson. But its decision had to come before 30 September 2007. But what did Rowan Williams do? Let me now quote Archbishop Peter Akinola, the Primate of All Nigeria (and on the GAFCON leadership team). In his opening address at the conference he reminded the 1100 plus participants of what happened next:<br><br>“Strangely, before the deadline, and before the Primates could get the opportunity of meeting to assess the adequacy of the response of TEC [the Episcopal Church] and in a clear demonstration of unwillingness to follow through our collective decisions which for many of us was an apparent lack of regard for the Primates, Lambeth Palace in July 2007 issued invitations to TEC bishops including those who consecrated Gene Robinson to attend the Lambeth 2008 conference. At this point it dawned upon us, regrettably, that the Archbishop of Canterbury was not interested in what matters to us, in what we think or in what we say.”<br><br>The Archbishop of Canterbury seemed so “not interested” that last November (2007) he decided to preside and preach at a “secret” service of Holy Communion for Church of England gay clergy and their partners. This shocked many as Holy Communion should never cause a “scandal” (according to the rubric in the Book of Common Prayer service – the Anglican standard).<br><br>Why GAFCON?<br><br>It was for all these, and other reasons, said Archbishop Akinola, that GAFCON came about: “we cannot succumb to this turmoil in our Communion and simply watch helplessly. We have found ourselves in a world in which Anglican leaders hold on to a form of religion but consistently deny its power.” To be fair to Rowan Williams, he now is seeking, as Archbishop of Canterbury and as best he can, to “uphold” the orthodox position. But if he personally is still not convinced of the clear biblical teaching prohibiting gay sex, he will not be teaching the orthodox position effectively nor will he properly refute erroneous views. Yet the Church of England Canon C18 requires “every bishop ... to teach and to uphold sound and wholesome doctrine, and to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange opinion.” Nor is this a secondary issue. “Let’s talk about knife crime and the poor and not sexuality,” say some, including Gene Robinson. But according to the Archbishop of the Sudan, Daniel Deng Bul, speaking at the Lambeth Conference at the end of July 2008 and calling on Gene Robinson to resign, this is certainly not a secondary issue for him. It is a life and death issue:<br><br>“This issue of homosexuality in the Anglican Communion has a very serious effect in my country. We are called ‘infidels’ by the Moslems. That means that they will do whatever they can against us to keep us from damaging the people of our country. They challenge our people to convert to Islam and leave the infidel Anglican Church. When our people refuse, sometimes they are killed. These people are very evil and mutilate and harm our people. I am begging the Communion on this issue so no more of my people will be killed.”<br><br>Scriptural authority<br><br>The real issue, of course, is scriptural authority; and that relates to the question “what does it mean to be Anglican?” Is Anglicanism to be defined as a Communion of those who can subscribe to a doctrinal basis, namely the legal basis of the Church of England, that says Anglican doctrine ...<br><br>“... is grounded in the Holy Scriptures and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular, such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal” (Canon A5)?<br><br>Or is Anglicanism to be defined by the so called four Instruments of Unity – the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lambeth Conference, the Primates Meeting and the ACC (Anglican Advisory Council) even when there is no longer doctrinal agreement? The idea that mere structures can sustain unity without an agreed agenda of adequate common belief, is to live in cloud-cuckoo land. Indeed, it is a recipe for chaos. So the GAFCON statement makes it clear where it stands. It defines Anglicanism as a Communion of those united by their confession of Canon A5 (and it underlines the value of the Thirty-nine Articles). It does not see invitations to the Lambeth Conference by the Archbishop of Canterbury as necessarily definitive. It follows, of course, that those who do not subscribe to that Anglican confession are the schismatics, not those who absent themselves from a Lambeth Conference. It is interesting to note that a document discussed by the bishops at  the Lambeth Conference at the end of July and called the St Andrew’s Draft Covenant has a less robust profession for Anglicanism:<br><br>“it professes the faith which is uniquely revealed in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament as containing all things necessary for salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith, and which is set forth in the catholic creeds, and to which the historic formularies of the Church of England bear significant witness, which faith the Church is called upon to proclaim afresh in each generation.”<br><br>This form of words follows the “liberal” revised Church of England Canon C15 that since the 1970s has allowed clergy to hold any and every belief. It looks good. But without requiring assent to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England that previously was required, there is no control on how little you need to be believe to be a clergyman. In the words of a Church of England Doctrine Commission report, there are now people who <br><br>“would respect the dogmas of the Church (epitomized in the creeds) as showing, in the language and thought-forms of the age that produced them, balanced and authoritative affirmations, excluding false theological solutions and including the necessary theological ingredients. For such Christians, however, both doctrines and dogmas are so inadequate to the living reality of whom they are the attempted theological formulations that they cannot command full commitment or loyalty. In the best sense of the word they are ‘provisional’.” <br><br>So GAFCON is once again taking the Thirty-nine Articles seriously. Without doing so people can believe all or (almost) nothing while claiming to be “Anglican”.<br><br>“Expressly declared”<br><br>But why is it the homosexual issue in particular the issue that has fractured the Anglican Communion? The answer probably is in the last words of Article XVII of the Thirty-nine: “in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God.”<br><br>The prohibition on same sex relationships is “expressly declared” in the Bible. It is not ambiguous. That is the consensus of the Church of England bishops who have admitted that there is ...<br><br>“... in Scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong, monogamous heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings. Sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable” (Issues in Human Sexuality 1991 p 18).<br><br>Such an “express declaration” means it is not possible to claim submission to biblical authority with integrity and say that such relationships are right. They are “expressly declared” as wrong. (Of course, the Bible is not saying it is wrong to be tempted sexually; rather it is wrong to pretend such desires are right and good).<br><br>Because this prohibition is clear from the Bible, its rejection raises much deeper questions about biblical authority. As the Church of England, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, bases itself (or “grounds” itself – Canon A5) on the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles, which you have in the Bible, plain rejections of biblical authority require church discipline. The GAFCON leadership, representing two-thirds of world Anglicanism, felt that such a lack of doctrinal discipline on the part of the Archbishop of Canterbury was serious. This lack of discipline was especially evidenced by the invitations to Lambeth of those who consecrated Gene Robinson while there were no invitations for their own bishops who have been helping believers in heretical dioceses. It, therefore, seemed wise to set up an international conference for Anglican bishops and other leaders to consult, to encourage one another and to begin something that, God willing, will help unite the true Anglican Communion. <br><br>So much for background. The following is the final statement that came out of Jerusalem – and it was a truly collaborative effort.<br>_______________<br><br><br>STATEMENT ON THE GLOBAL ANGLICAN FUTURE<br><br>Praise the LORD! It is good to sing praises to our God; for he is gracious, and a song of praise is fitting. The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel. (Psalm 147:1-2) <br><br>Brothers and Sisters in Christ: We, the participants in the Global Anglican Future Conference, send you greetings from Jerusalem! <br><br>Introduction <br><br>The Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON), which was held in Jerusalem from 22-29 June 2008, is a spiritual movement to preserve and promote the truth and power of the gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ as we Anglicans have received it. The movement is global: it has mobilised Anglicans from around the world. We are Anglican: 1148 lay and clergy participants, including 291 bishops representing millions of faithful Anglican Christians. We cherish our Anglican heritage and the Anglican Communion and have no intention of departing from it. And we believe that, in God’s providence, Anglicanism has a bright future in obedience to our Lord’s Great Commission to make disciples of all nations and to build up the church on the foundation of biblical truth (Matthew 28:18-20; Ephesians 2:20).<br><br>GAFCON is not just a moment in time, but a movement in the Spirit, and we hereby: <br><br>•	launch the GAFCON movement as a fellowship of confessing Anglicans <br>•	publish the Jerusalem Declaration as the basis of the fellowship <br>•	encourage GAFCON Primates to form a Council. <br><br>The Global Anglican Context <br><br>The future of the Anglican Communion is but a piece of the wider scenario of opportunities and challenges for the gospel in 21st century global culture. We rejoice in the way God has opened doors for gospel mission among many peoples, but we grieve for the spiritual decline in the most economically developed nations, where the forces of militant secularism and pluralism are eating away the fabric of society and churches are compromised and enfeebled in their witness. The vacuum left by them is readily filled by other faiths and deceptive cults. To meet these challenges will require Christians to work together to understand and oppose these forces and to liberate those under their sway. It will entail the planting of new churches among unreached peoples and also committed action to restore authentic Christianity to compromised churches. <br><br>The Anglican Communion, present in six continents, is well positioned to address this challenge, but currently it is divided and distracted. The Global Anglican Future Conference emerged in response to a crisis within the Anglican Communion, a crisis involving three undeniable facts concerning world Anglicanism. <br><br>The first fact is the acceptance and promotion within the provinces of the Anglican Communion of a different ‘gospel’ (cf. Galatians 1:6-8) which is contrary to the apostolic gospel. This false gospel undermines the authority of God’s Word written and the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the author of salvation from sin, death and judgement. Many of its proponents claim that all religions offer equal access to God and that Jesus is only a way, not the way, the truth and the life. It promotes a variety of sexual preferences and immoral behaviour as a universal human right. It claims God’s blessing for same-sex unions over against the biblical teaching on holy matrimony. In 2003 this false gospel led to the consecration of a bishop living in a homosexual relationship. <br><br>The second fact is the declaration by provincial bodies in the Global South that they are out of communion with bishops and churches that promote this false gospel. These declarations have resulted in a realignment whereby faithful Anglican Christians have left existing territorial parishes, dioceses and provinces in certain Western churches and become members of other dioceses and provinces, all within the Anglican Communion. These actions have also led to the appointment of new Anglican bishops set over geographic areas already occupied by other Anglican bishops. A major realignment has occurred and will continue to unfold. <br><br>The third fact is the manifest failure of the Communion Instruments to exercise discipline in the face of overt heterodoxy. The Episcopal Church USA and the Anglican Church of Canada, in proclaiming this false gospel, have consistently defied the 1998 Lambeth statement of biblical moral principle (Resolution 1.10). Despite numerous meetings and reports to and from the ‘Instruments of Unity,’ no effective action has been taken, and the bishops of these unrepentant churches are welcomed to Lambeth 2008. To make matters worse, there has been a failure to honour promises of discipline, the authority of the Primates’ Meeting has been undermined and the Lambeth Conference has been structured so as to avoid any hard decisions. We can only come to the devastating conclusion that ‘we are a global Communion with a colonial structure’. <br><br>Sadly, this crisis has torn the fabric of the Communion in such a way that it cannot simply be patched back together. At the same time, it has brought together many Anglicans across the globe into personal and pastoral relationships in a fellowship which is faithful to biblical teaching, more representative of the demographic distribution of global Anglicanism today and stronger as an instrument of effective mission, ministry and social involvement. <br><br>A Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans <br><br>We, the participants in the Global Anglican Future Conference, are a fellowship of confessing Anglicans for the benefit of the Church and the furtherance of its mission. We are a fellowship of people united in the communion (koinonia) of the one Spirit and committed to work and pray together in the common mission of Christ. It is a confessing fellowship in that its members confess the faith of Christ crucified, stand firm for the gospel in the global and Anglican context, and affirm a contemporary rule, the Jerusalem Declaration, to guide the movement for the future. We are a fellowship of Anglicans, including provinces, dioceses, churches, missionary jurisdictions, para-church organisations and individual Anglican Christians whose goal is to reform, heal and revitalise the Anglican Communion and expand its mission to the world. <br><br>Our fellowship is not breaking away from the Anglican Communion. We, together with many other faithful Anglicans throughout the world, believe the doctrinal foundation of Anglicanism, which defines our core identity as Anglicans, is expressed in these words: The doctrine of the Church is grounded in the Holy Scriptures and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular, such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal. We intend to remain faithful to this standard, and we call on others in the Communion to reaffirm and return to it. While acknowledging the nature of Canterbury as an historic see, we do not accept that Anglican identity is determined necessarily through recognition by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Building on the above doctrinal foundation of Anglican identity, we hereby publish the Jerusalem Declaration as the basis of our fellowship. <br><br>THE JERUSALEM DECLARATION <br><br>In the name of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit: <br><br>We, the participants in the Global Anglican Future Conference, have met in the land of Jesus’ birth. We express our loyalty as disciples to the King of kings, the Lord Jesus. We joyfully embrace his command to proclaim the reality of his kingdom which he first announced in this land. The gospel of the kingdom is the good news of salvation, liberation and transformation for all. In light of the above, we agree to chart a way forward together that promotes and protects the biblical gospel and mission to the world, solemnly declaring the following tenets of orthodoxy which underpin our Anglican identity.<br><br>1.	We rejoice in the gospel of God through which we have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Because God first loved us, we love him and as believers bring forth fruits of love, ongoing repentance, lively hope and thanksgiving to God in all things. <br>2.	We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God written and to contain all things necessary for salvation. The Bible is to be translated, read, preached, taught and obeyed in its plain and canonical sense, respectful of the church’s historic and consensual reading. <br>3.	We uphold the four Ecumenical Councils and the three historic Creeds as expressing the rule of faith of the one holy catholic and apostolic Church. <br>4.	We uphold the Thirty-nine Articles as containing the true doctrine of the Church agreeing with God’s Word and as authoritative for Anglicans today. <br>5.	We gladly proclaim and submit to the unique and universal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, humanity’s only Saviour from sin, judgement and hell, who lived the life we could not live and died the death that we deserve. By his atoning death and glorious resurrection, he secured the redemption of all who come to him in repentance and faith. <br>6.	We rejoice in our Anglican sacramental and liturgical heritage as an expression of the gospel, and we uphold the 1662 Book of Common Prayer as a true and authoritative standard of worship and prayer, to be translated and locally adapted for each culture. <br>7.	We recognise that God has called and gifted bishops, priests and deacons in historic succession to equip all the people of God for their ministry in the world. We uphold the classic Anglican Ordinal as an authoritative standard of clerical orders. <br>8.	We acknowledge God’s creation of humankind as male and female and the unchangeable standard of Christian marriage between one man and one woman as the proper place for sexual intimacy and the basis of the family. We repent of our failures to maintain this standard and call for a renewed commitment to lifelong fidelity in marriage and abstinence for those who are not married. <br>9.	We gladly accept the Great Commission of the risen Lord to make disciples of all nations, to seek those who do not know Christ and to baptise, teach and bring new believers to maturity. <br>10.	We are mindful of our responsibility to be good stewards of God’s creation, to uphold and advocate justice in society, and to seek relief and empowerment of the poor and needy. <br>11.	We are committed to the unity of all those who know and love Christ and to building authentic ecumenical relationships. We recognise the orders and jurisdiction of those Anglicans who uphold orthodox faith and practice, and we encourage them to join us in this declaration. <br>12.	We celebrate the God-given diversity among us which enriches our global fellowship, and we acknowledge freedom in secondary matters. We pledge to work together to seek the mind of Christ on issues that divide us. <br>13.	We reject the authority of those churches and leaders who have denied the orthodox faith in word or deed. We pray for them and call on them to repent and return to the Lord. <br>14.	We rejoice at the prospect of Jesus’ coming again in glory, and while we await this final event of history, we praise him for the way he builds up his church through his Spirit by miraculously changing lives. <br><br>The Road Ahead <br><br>We believe the Holy Spirit has led us during this week in Jerusalem to begin a new work. There are many important decisions for the development of this fellowship which will take more time, prayer and deliberation. Among other matters, we shall seek to expand participation in this fellowship beyond those who have come to Jerusalem, including cooperation with the Global South and the Council of Anglican Provinces in Africa. We can, however, discern certain milestones on the road ahead. <br><br>Primates’ Council <br><br>We, the participants in the Global Anglican Future Conference, do hereby acknowledge the participating Primates of GAFCON who have called us together, and encourage them to form the initial Council of the GAFCON movement. We look forward to the enlargement of the Council and entreat the Primates to organise and expand the fellowship of confessing Anglicans. <br><br>We urge the Primates’ Council to authenticate and recognise confessing Anglican jurisdictions, clergy and congregations and to encourage all Anglicans to promote the gospel and defend the faith. <br><br>We recognise the desirability of territorial jurisdiction for provinces and dioceses of the Anglican Communion, except in those areas where churches and leaders are denying the orthodox faith or are preventing its spread, and in a few areas for which overlapping jurisdictions are beneficial for historical or cultural reasons. <br><br>We thank God for the courageous actions of those Primates and provinces who have offered orthodox oversight to churches under false leadership, especially in North and South America. The actions of these Primates have been a positive response to pastoral necessities and mission opportunities. We believe that such actions will continue to be necessary and we support them in offering help around the world. <br><br>We believe this is a critical moment when the Primates’ Council will need to put in place structures to lead and support the church. In particular, we believe the time is now ripe for the formation of a province in North America for the federation currently known as Common Cause Partnership to be recognised by the Primates’ Council. <br><br>Conclusion: Message from Jerusalem <br><br>We, the participants in the Global Anglican Future Conference, were summoned by the Primates’ leadership team to Jerusalem in June 2008 to deliberate on the crisis that has divided the Anglican Communion for the past decade and to seek direction for the future. We have visited holy sites, prayed together, listened to God’s Word preached and expounded, learned from various speakers and teachers, and shared our thoughts and hopes with each other. <br><br>The meeting in Jerusalem this week was called in a sense of urgency that a false gospel has so paralysed the Anglican Communion that this crisis must be addressed. The chief threat of this dispute involves the compromising of the integrity of the church’s worldwide mission. The primary reason we have come to Jerusalem and issued this declaration is to free our churches to give clear and certain witness to Jesus Christ. <br><br>It is our hope that this Statement on the Global Anglican Future will be received with comfort and joy by many Anglicans around the world who have been distressed about the direction of the Communion. We believe the Anglican Communion should and will be reformed around the biblical gospel and mandate to go into all the world and present Christ to the nations. <br><br>Jerusalem<br>Feast of St Peter and St Paul<br>29 June 2008 <br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Miracles, Science and the Modern World">(September 2008) Miracles, Science and the Modern World</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2008</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>(On these September 2008 Sunday mornings we are looking at the life and times of Elisha. Among other things this sermon series raises questions about miracles. Are they believable? What can be said about them in the 21st century? The following is from my book on the truth and meaning of the Resurrection, Where did Jesus go? To help our thinking, here is a slightly edited extract from the first chapter.)<br><br><b>The Miraculous</b><br><br>Many people believe that the real problems about the resurrection of Jesus all have to do with ‘miracles’ and ‘science’. “How is it possible for someone to rise from the dead? Some people can believe anything,” they say.<br><br>Has science proved that ‘miracles’ can’t happen? There are still a lot of people who believe it has. </p>

<blockquote><div>“Nature is entirely predictable,” they say. “What happens in nature can be discovered by able men and women in universities and research establishments. If certain things baffle us at the moment, it is only a matter of time before all will be made clear. But what is now clear is that miracles don’t happen and people certainly don’t rise from the dead.”</div></blockquote>

<p>A playboy socialite from Edinburgh held this view a couple of hundred years ago. His name was David Hume. It was just when modern science was beginning to develop. Although he was equally as happy with the high life of those days as with writing essays and books, he managed to give time to writing extensively on philosophical subjects. These essays and books have been of lasting influence. In one of them he gave ‘classic’ expression to the belief in science and disbelief in miracles. “A miracle,” he wrote, </p>

<blockquote><div>“… is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined” (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, X Of Miracles i.90).</div></blockquote>

<p>Much, however, has changed in the last two hundred or so years, with much changing recently. The bubble of scientific confidence, it has been said, burst at the end of the twentieth century. The scientific dream is now no longer with us – the dream that through scientific discovery and invention all the ‘secrets of the universe’ can be unlocked, the dream that in time all of us will be able to live lives of unfettered comfort and ease. It has been said that at the end of the twentieth century we passed beyond …</p>

<blockquote><div>“… a profoundly significant moment … in the history of mankind – the moment when it became apparent that, even on their own terms, science and technology were no longer necessarily making life better, easier, more efficient for us all.”</div></blockquote>

<p>We needn’t bother with the reasons for this. Perhaps an uncontrolled desire for material things has caused it – a desire that leads to economic stress on a universal scale, with problems for rich and poor alike. Perhaps the abuse of science is a cause. One of the first secretaries of the Royal Society when it was founded as a scientific institution was a bishop. He would have been horrified at the use of science for mass destruction and environmental pollution!<br><br>Whatever the cause, there does seem to be shift of mood and belief and, indeed, there are quite radical developments in some quarters in this new ‘post modern’ world. People are no longer confident about the physical universe in the way Hume used to be. Perhaps the world is more strange than we thought. However bizarre it may seem, some have tried fusing mysticism with science. They believe that the world of ‘spirit’ can affect the world of ‘matter’. In the book Mysticism and the New Physics Michael Talbot claimed that the old certainties have now gone. “Slowly,” he says, </p>

<blockquote><div>“… the tremendous mass of the scientific establishment begins to feel the first tremors of a radical and awesome new age … Perhaps the change will be felt like a roll of thunder as old constructions fall and new ones take their place. Perhaps the change will be so subtle and gradual that we will have no more sense of it than the anti-Copernicans during the lifetime of Galileo, who did not feel the earth move. Whatever the case, the message of the new physics is that we are participators in a universe of ever-increasing wonder.”</div></blockquote>

<p>None of this solves the problems of miracles. It just makes people all the more bewildered. What does any ‘new physics’ have to say about the Resurrection? Very little. But it means that at last people are prepared to give the resurrection of Jesus a fairer hearing, or some are! In the past there has often been what James Martin calls a “deep-rooted prejudice against belief in the Resurrection.” This has affected many people.</p>

<blockquote><div>“Dominated by the modern mind, they find it well-nigh impossible to think of the Resurrection as a real possibility. Miracles, they are sure, do not happen, cannot happen, never did happen. Therefore the Resurrection cannot be true.”</div></blockquote>

<p>But a wind of change is blowing.<br><br><b>The limits of science</b><br><br>What can science tell us? Natural Science – physics, chemistry, biology etc. – has been very important for all of us in the modern world. True, the world today may be confused. Time magazine once described Britain, the place where modern science grew up, as “adrift in a deepening crisis of faith.” But no one would want to lose all the real advantages won by science and technology over the last centuries and during the twentieth century in particular. Indeed, we could now be faced with a reaction. <br><br>Today there is a danger of going to the other extreme, as there is a fascination for many, with the irrational and the uncanny. That is leading to “a revolt of the soul against the intellect” – to use W.B.Yeat’s phrase.<br><br>But the Christian isn’t over impressed with that reaction. The Christian believes in a rational, orderly universe that science can investigate. He or she finds no problem in its stability. In one sense it is only against such a background that miracles can occur. A miracle can be contrasted with the apparently normal only because there is a normal, orderly pattern to the universe’s working. In the words of God as reported in Genesis:</p>

<blockquote><div>“As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will never cease” (Gen 8.22).</div></blockquote>

<p>The problems over science arise only when our thinking about the material universe colours our thinking about the whole of the life of man. Why, for example, should man and society be likened either to the planets or to the machines of human invention? Over the centuries this has happened. The scientific mind elated with its successes in the non-human world has often, unwittingly, treated man as non-human. Man has gradually been seen as a miniature universe – a mass of interconnected laws of cause and effect, or as a sophisticated machine. But, of course, men are not miniature universes or machines. They are very different.<br><br>The reason why the natural sciences were so successful was because ‘nature’ or the universe of physical laws has been easier to understand and control than human nature. Human nature is very different and much harder to understand and control. It is easier to send a space craft to the moon and beyond than it is to solve the problems of Arab and Jew, Iraq and Afghanistan, rich and poor, or the violence on the streets of any major big city! That is why science has evolved the way it has with a huge success-rate in its investigation of the physical world.<br><br>But we need to remember the story of the man in the street at night looking down at the pavement under a lamp-post. “What are you doing?” he was asked. “I’ve lost my front door key,” he replied. “Are you sure you’ve lost it under the lamp-post?” “No, but this is the only place where I can see!”<br><br>We must be careful, therefore, before we look for the key to human life with the lamp of science; perhaps we need another lamp. In his Gifford Lectures the German physicist and philosopher C.F.von Wiezäcker put it like this: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Science cannot select the order in which it wants to treat its subjects according to their importance for human life. The motion of the planets is not relevant to human happiness or salvation. But it turned out to be a comparatively simple problem for mathematical treatment, and thus through the efforts of Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton its theory became the keystone of modern science. Human nature is less simple.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Man has a free will. That is what makes the difference. Although subject to environmental and hereditary factors, man can act creatively on his own. He is not totally determined, nor is he a robot.<br><br>But it has to be admitted some disagree. “Can we really determine,” they say, “even a small part of the universe? Even when we think we are acting freely, how can we be sure?”<br><br>Part of the answer comes from the fact of the resurrection of Jesus. If the tomb was empty, if he really rose from the dead, if God is ‘there’, man is certainly not just a ‘throw-up’ of the physical universe. God is ultimate. His is the last word, not the laws of an impersonal universe. Man is then in his image and thus a free creative being.<br><br>How important, then, that we discover the truth about the resurrection of Jesus! To do that we need to look at facts, not theories.<br><br><b>Miracles in the New Testament</b><br><br>We face a paradox in the New Testament over the miracles of Jesus. On the one hand, just to take Mark’s gospel alone, we find a great deal about miracles. Thirty-one per cent of the Gospel, 209 out of 666 verses, is taken up with miracle stories. In the early chapters it is forty-seven per cent. “St Mark without miracle is indeed Hamlet without the Prince.”<br><br>On the other hand, for all that is said about the miracles of Jesus, there is a desire to play them down. For example, when Jesus once healed a leper, he said to the man, “See that you don’t tell this to anyone” (Mark 1.44).<br><br>Jesus was aware that his miracles, or ‘signs’ as John prefers to call them, would be misunderstood. They were not so much for ‘evidential’ value; rather they were the result of his love in the face of suffering. By themselves apart from his total teaching they could mislead people. As a result of a miracle on one occasion the Jews tried to make Jesus a king. <br><br>There had just been a miraculous feeding of five thousand people and the conclusion drawn was: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world” (John 6.14)</div></blockquote>

<p>. But the miracle misled them. They had wrong ideas about the sort of person he was and the sort of role that ‘the prophet’ was to fulfil. ‘Miracle’ was only part of the story.<br><br>The miracles of the New Testament can only be viewed in the light of the Old Testament and its understanding of God and the universe. Here the important thing to remember is that the Hebrews were so different to many of the Greeks and many of us today!<br><br>Basically the Greeks (and their successors) tried first of all to make sure of ‘nature’; and when that was done, they fitted God in. The Hebrews, as we can see from the Old Testament, went about it the other way round. They first tried to make sure of God, and then saw where ‘nature’ fitted in. They did not think of a closed, self-sufficient universe or system of ‘nature’. In fact they hardly thought in terms of ‘nature’ at all. God’s word and his will were what they were concerned with. For example, spring follows winter and summer follows spring in response to God’s command, not in obedience to ‘natural laws’.<br><br>The ancient Israelite believed in regularity just as much as his Greek counterpart. But for him it is regularity in the character of God, not a purely physical regularity; he knew the character of God to be consistent and true to his word.<br><br>For this reason in the Bible miracles are not seen as bizarre, irrational interventions from outside. That was more of a pagan view, not a Christian one. Rather they are seen to be consistent with the justice and love of God, and so as we would expect there is a restraint about the reporting of them. This immediately separates them off from many other reported miracles, ancient and modern.<br><br><b>A God-centred universe</b><br><br>Plutarch was a priest of the Greek god, Apollo, and an exact contemporary of Mark; but the miracles they write about are so different.<br><br>In one of his works Plutarch tells about the Greek general Pyrrhus (of ‘Pyrrhic victory’ fame). He mentions how once the general was involved in a sacrifice, when suddenly the severed heads of the oxen that had been killed stuck out their tongues. They then began to like up their own blood! Plutarch describes this as “a remarkable portent” or (literally) “a great sign”. It is inconceivable that that sort of thing could have been one of the ‘signs’ of Jesus.<br><br>It cannot be too often said: the biblical miracles are not to be seen as ‘suspensions of natural laws’. For some have seen God as the great ‘clockmaker’, who puts the world together, winds it up and then lets it tick. From time to time he presses the ‘stop’ button and ‘does a miracle’. No! The Bible’s view is that God created and still sustains the world. There is a permanent, continuing relationship between God and what we call the material universe. In fact it is Jesus Christ himself, according to the New Testament, who is the ‘agent’ in this process. </p>

<blockquote><div>“In him all things hold together” (Col 1.17)</div></blockquote>

<p> That was Paul’s staggering assertion. The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews said that he is </p>

<blockquote><div>“sustaining all things by his powerful word” (Heb 1.3).</div></blockquote>

<p> Jesus Christ is at the heart of the universe – or so those early Christians believed and taught. If that is true, the Resurrection far from being odd is what you might expect!<br><br>So to recap, in the Bible the material universe within which the ‘miraculous’ takes place is all part of God’s realm and in part it reflects his character.</p>

<blockquote><div>“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands” (Ps 19.1).</div></blockquote>

<p> That is why the ultimate principle of order and regularity is to be seen not in the physical universe, but in the God who is the creator of that universe. </p>

<blockquote><div>“The only ultimate regularity,” wrote C.F.D.Moule,</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>“… is to be looked for not within the material realm by itself but in the character of a personal God. It is of his character that the material realm is a manifestation: and what is possible and probable in it, is better measured by what is known of the character of God than by what is observed on the much narrower scale of the purely mechanical.”</div></blockquote>

<p>When we look at Jesus, we see, says the Christian, the character of God. </p>

<blockquote><div>“Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father,” said Jesus (John 14.9).</div></blockquote>

<p> And what we find to be true of Jesus may have to make us revise our ideas of ‘the possible’.<br><br>A miracle therefore is not so much an intervention or a suspension of natural law; rather it is what happens when the love and goodness of God is directed in an intense way at imperfections of nature and history. God’s activity in nature and history is “focused to burning-point” in miracle.<br><br>And that is why the miracle stories of the Apocryphal literature have to be rejected. They are often so out of keeping with the character of Jesus. But the resurrection of Jesus is a very different matter.<br><br>We shall never be able to get away from the ‘miraculous’ in Christianity. In fact it is a distinguishing mark of the Christian faith as compared with some other main religions. Yes, in some popular forms of other religions there is a belief in miracles. But Confucius was not a miraculous figure. The Buddha allowed only “the miracles of the revelation of man’s inner self”; for him it is in knowledge that the miraculous is to be found. Muhammed also disclaimed the power to work miracles; the Qur’ān alone was miraculous.<br><br>And remember: the strongest evidence for the miracles of Jesus comes from his enemies. They objected to his works of power. But in the New Testament there is no indication that they generally denied them. True, when Jesus healed a man born blind, the Jews at first were reluctant to believe that this had really happened. John tells us: <br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>“The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents. ‘Is this your son?’ they asked. ‘Is this the one you say was born blind?’” (John 9.18-19).</div></blockquote>

<p> <br><br>They were then forced to accept the facts. In the end they had to admit the healing and the power of Jesus.<br><br>So we mustn’t be prejudiced by some assumptions people easily can have about science and miracles. We need, instead, to see how the Bible understands the ‘miraculous’. In the light of that we need to think about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and other claims to the miraculous in the Bible.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Creation, The Royal Society and John Lennox">(October 2008) Creation, The Royal Society and John Lennox</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2008</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Royal Society and the Rev Professor Michael Reiss</b><br><br>A short time before he died G.K.Chesterton said in 1934: </p>

<blockquote><div>“some … were told, a long while ago, that the world was made in six days. Most of you are now told that modern science contradicts this: a statement which is certainly much more of a lie than the statement it contradicts.”</div></blockquote>

<p> Those Fellows of the Royal Society who last month forced the resignation of the Rev Professor Michael Reiss from his Royal Society post, should heed Chesterton’s words. Reiss had suggested that “creationism” should be treated as a “world-view” in science education “rather than as demonstrably unscientific.” The Times newspaper, supporting the attack on Reiss, said (12 September 2008) his mistake was “that it is acceptable to teach faith as if it were science.” But what is “creationism”? According to The Times (and the New Oxford Dictionary) it is the belief that:</p>

<blockquote><div>“the universe and living organisms originated from acts of divine creation. This belief embraces the biblical account and rejects theories in which natural processes are central, such as evolution. Some creationists have accepted geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth, insisting that such accounts do not necessarily contradict Biblical teachings.”</div></blockquote>

<p>So creationists do not hold natural processes as central - but they do not have to deny them. Nor are they all “six twenty-four hour days” creationists - for they may accept geological findings and other methods of dating the earth. But the convictions of these people who believe God created the world, now according to the Royal Society, are not to be discussed in science lessons. That, however, is quite contrary to the new National Curriculum whose programmes of study are to identify “the big ideas” that underpin any subject. The new Statutory content requirement on “How science works” says explicitly that pupils should be taught: </p>

<blockquote><div>“how explanations of many phenomena can be developed using scientific theories, models and ideas; that there are some questions that science cannot currently answer, and some that science cannot address; and how uncertainties in scientific knowledge and scientific ideas change over time and about the role of the scientific community in validating these changes.”</div></blockquote>

<p> So it would seem that this attack on Professor Reiss is evidence of illiberalism and bigotry among a few scientists. The Sunday following Reiss’ resignation, Peter Atkins, professor of chemistry at Oxford, and an honorary associate of the National Secular Society, was interviewed on the BBC Sunday Programme. When asked whether clergy [referring to Michael Reiss] have any role to play in the Royal Society, he said: “Oh, none whatsoever … after all, religion is all about obfuscation.” When asked if he was interested in dialogue with religious people, he replied: “I’m interested in dialogue in the sense of trying to stamp out religion.” Thankfully, in academia, there are not only aggressive atheists. John Lennox also teaches at Oxford. A mathematician and philosopher of science he recently published God’s Undertaker: has science buried God? It was reviewed in The Guardian last December by a distinguished biologist, Colin Tudge. What follows (with the permission of the Newspaper Licensing Agency) is the full review.<br><br><b>John Lennox and God’s Undertaker </b><br><br>“Well - has science buried God? Of course not. John Lennox answers his own question decisively. No one who understands what science really is and is not could suppose that such interment was ever on the cards. No one who understands what religion really is, beneath its sometimes ugly face, could suppose that it would be good to bury it.<br><br>Why then does Lennox, reader in maths at Oxford and outstanding Christian scholar, feel it is necessary to ask the question at all? Because the notion that the two must be at loggerheads has of late been trumpeted by many a pundit, including American philosopher Dan Dennett, Oxford professor of chemistry Peter Atkins and, most eloquently, Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins. Atkins and Dawkins are prominent scientists - Dawkins one of the most original theorists of our age. But on matters of theology their arguments are a disgrace: assertive without substance; demanding evidence while offering none; staggeringly unscholarly.<br><br>For all the great founders of modern science - Galileo, Newton, Descartes, Robert Boyle, John Ray and their Muslim predecessors - their research was itself an act of reverence. The list continues through the 19th century, with Faraday, Babbage and Kelvin. From our present age, Lennox quotes Sir Ghillean Prance, former director of Kew: </p>

<blockquote><div>‘All my studies have confirmed my faith.’</div></blockquote>

<p> Contrast this with Atkins, more hardline even than Dawkins: </p>

<blockquote><div>‘There is no reason to suppose that science cannot deal with every aspect of existence. Only the religious - among whom I include not only the prejudiced but the underinformed - hope that there is a dark corner of the universe that science can never hope to illuminate.’</div></blockquote>

<p> And: ‘</p>

<blockquote><div>Humanity should accept that science has eliminated the justification for believing in cosmic purpose.’</div></blockquote>

<p>Yet Atkins, as a professor of science, must be aware of Sir Peter Medawar's famous adage, adapted from Bismarck, ‘Science is the art of the soluble’. Scientists study only those aspects of the universe that it is within their gift to study: what is observable; what is measurable and amenable to statistical analysis; and, indeed, what they can afford to study within the means and time available. Science thus emerges as a giant tautology, a ‘closed system’. It can present us with robust answers only because its practitioners take very great care to tailor the questions.<br><br>Religion, by contrast, accepts the limitations of our senses and brains and posits at least the possibility that there is more going on than meets the eye - a meta-dimension that might be called transcendental. Dawkins talks of religion not simply as ‘faith’ but as ‘blind faith’ - yet this, as Lennox points out, is a simple calumny. The greatest theologians, beginning at least as early as St Paul and continuing through Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas and Newman and again into modern times, have never been ‘blind’. All have stressed the need to take account of the facts of the case (the thing that science is good at) and to engage the intellect: absolutely not to believe things blindly.<br><br>Taking seriously the idea of transcendence is very reasonable indeed. As many modern physicists have pointed out, the universe simply could not function - the Big Bang would never have happened, or if it did would simply have made a mess - if all the physical constants, from the magnitude of gravity to the mass of the proton, had not been exactly right. Of course, we can explain such consistency without invoking intelligence and purpose, but as Lennox shows, the arguments needed to do this are extraordinarily contrived. Ironically, these arguments break the rule of parsimony - always opt for the simplest explanation - which lies at the heart of science itself.<br><br>It is perfectly rational to propose that the universe is indeed without purpose - that what we see is all there is. But to assert that this is so, as Dawkins and Atkins do, is not at all ‘rational’. It is merely a piece of dogma. Indeed, atheism - when you boil it down - is little more than dogma: simple denial, a refusal to take seriously the proposition that there could be more to the universe than meets the eye. To use science to justify such dogma, as these professors do, is a gross misuse of their own trade.<br><br>More specifically, Dawkins famously showed that it is possible to build a computer model that could generate huge complexity - analogous in an arm-waving way to the complexity of nature - just by applying an all-purpose rule, an algorithm [a list of instructions], that simulated natural selection. Indeed, says Lennox. But the algorithm works only because it has been very carefully designed - by Dawkins. Yet Dawkins argues that the complexity of nature - many orders of magnitude greater than anything that a computer can simulate - has been achieved by an analogous algorithm that does not, apparently, require intelligence. If Dawkins could show how the algorithm that has produced the living world could arise spontaneously, then he would have gone a long way to making his point. As things stand, he has not begun even to address it. He is taken seriously in this not because his arguments are sound but because he is an outstanding rhetorician. It is the art of bamboozlement.<br><br>There is no more important debate than this - science versus religion. But it needs to begin again, with a clear understanding of what science and religion actually are. Lennox has done this wonderfully.” So wrote Colin Tudge.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>With regard to “origins” it is wise, in my judgment, to be cautious over the interpretation of Genesis and its “six days”, not least because according to Psalm 90 verse 4 (claimed to be by Moses)</p>

<blockquote><div> “a thousand years in [God’s] sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.”</div></blockquote>

<p> So centuries before Darwin (and Dawkins) great theologians like Augustine have said: “What kind of days these were, it is extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive”. On the other hand philosophers of science have argued that some scientific theories are not simple descriptions of fact but models with built-in inferring techniques. These can be valuable. But such theories including “Evolution with a capital E” may be one half science and one half metaphysics “and are not so much scientific discoveries as scientific myths” (Toulmin, Contemporary Scientific Mythology). All this, surely, needs to be discussed in the classroom along with Stephen Hawking’s comment in A Brief History of Time that </p>

<blockquote><div>“it would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun … except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us.”</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Advent and a Difficult Doctrine">(December 2008) Advent and a Difficult Doctrine</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2008</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Four Last Things</b><br><br>Advent is the season when Christians are to think about the Four Last Things – death, judgment, heaven and hell. <br><br>Most would rather go straight to the story of Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem. But in the same way as it is wise to have a physical health check from time to time, it is good to have a spiritual health check and be asked the awkward questions – about death, judgment, heaven and hell. Death is real. It is in our papers and on our Radios and TV screens every day. But after death comes judgment according to the Bible (Heb 9.27). And judgment makes us think about heaven and hell. Few have a problem with heaven. But many have a problem with hell. In America a study conducted this year showed that 59 percent of people believed in hell. That was down from 71 percent in 2001. With regard to the UK, in Scotland 3 years ago it was discovered that out of 750 clergy from all denominations only 37 percent believed in hell. This is not good news. Jim Packer writes: </p>

<blockquote><div>“The sentimental secularism of modern Western culture, with its exalted optimism about human nature, its shrunken idea of God, and its scepticism as to whether personal morality really matters – in other words, its decay of conscience – makes it hard for Christians to take the reality of hell seriously … However, the doctrine of hell appears in the New Testament as a Christian essential, and we are called to try to understand it as Jesus and his apostles did.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The economy and hell</b><br><br>There appear to be economic consequences in a decline in a belief in hell which should challenge us today. Two years ago a US Federal Bank study found that there was a relationship between economic health and the percentage of a country’s population believing in hell. One Harvard study similarly found that non-economic factors, such as religion and religious beliefs in heaven and hell, explained some economic growth. The Federal Bank study showed as well some evidence that countries with higher levels of per capita gross domestic product had lower levels of corruption: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Countries that tend to have higher percentages of their population that believe in hell also tend to be less corrupt.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Of course, these are simply correlations, but they fit in with the idea that religious beliefs can influence economic outcomes, because religious beliefs do affect morality. Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous 19th century political scientist and early sociologist, had been clear on this. He held that </p>

<blockquote><div>“a religious country lessened its dependence on the public sector, which not only left a larger amount or resources for the private sector but enhanced the country’s moral fibre.”</div></blockquote>

<p> Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve Chairman, said in 2004, </p>

<blockquote><div>“rules cannot substitute for character. In virtually all transactions, whether with customers or with colleagues, we rely on the word of those with whom we do business. Even when followed to the letter, rules guide only a few of the day-to-day decisions required of business and financial managers. The rest are governed by whatever personal code of values managers bring to the table.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The New Testament teaching on hell</b><br><br>In the New Testament hell is seen as self-chosen (John 3.18-21). It for those who love darkness rather than light and who choose not to have their Creator as their Lord. They choose sin rather than righteousness and, if they have heard the gospel, they choose to reject rather than to accept Jesus Christ. Hell is described symbolically by terms like “fire” and “darkness” (obviously symbolic, as they would be mutually exclusive if literal). But the terms are meant to stand for something dreadful. And the purpose of this teaching is to make us thankful to God for providing a way of escape through Christ and then to encourage us to follow the escape route as fast as we would from a house on fire. People should thank God for being so clear about hell in the Bible!<br><br>While many Christian at first would like to believe, if they could, that all will be saved, many can then see why Christ was so insistent on teaching about hell. The reality of hell makes sense of so much. It explains Jesus’ mission. The Bible in Hebrews 1.3 summarizes that mission as providing “purification for sins” (Hebrews 1.3). The Cross was so fundamental to Jesus’ coming that first Christmas. Christ came to die for human sin and to experience on the cross in our place the hell we deserve for ignoring and disobeying God. So those who believe and trust in him as Saviour and Lord, can be free. Paul could say to some early converts: </p>

<blockquote><div>“you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead – Jesus who rescues us from the coming wrath” (1 Thess 1.9-10).</div></blockquote>

<p>Then there is the relationship of hell to our understanding and respect for human freedom. We live in a “victim” culture where often  no one is seen as responsible. All are victims! But Christ’s teaching gives the lie to such  a view. The doctrine of hell underlines and so safeguards the reality of human freedom and individual responsibility. For if God allows us to go away from him and from his light and love to darkness and hell, in spite of all his inducements to stop us doing so, we too should respect the freedoms of others. So the Christian should never seek to “impose” the gospel on anyone. Rather they should “propose” it for consideration, while praying for its free and willing acceptance. <br><br><b>But what of the unevangelized and other religions?</b><br><br>A student once asked the great Victorian preacher C.H.Spurgeon if he thought people of other religions who had never heard the gospel would be saved. His reply was: </p>

<blockquote><div>“it is more a question with me whether we who have the gospel and fail to give it to those who have not, can be saved.”</div></blockquote>

<p> And Jesus taught that we should be practically obedient rather than waste time on certain theological questions concerned with heaven and hell (Luke 13.23). We should, therefore, be motivated to evangelize, one, from a concern where thankfulness and obedience are being denied to the Sovereign Lord of the universe; two, from compassion for people who are spiritually lost, and, if Jesus is right, going literally to hell; and, three, from simple obedience to his clear command to tell others that he saves from sin and judgment and for a life that can be lived now creatively in the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>With Abraham we can know that the </p>

<blockquote><div>“judge of all the earth will do right” (Gen 18.25).</div></blockquote>

<p> And we can know that as in the case of the Gentile Cornelius in Acts 10, Peter’s conclusion was that </p>

<blockquote><div>“in every nation any one who fears [God] and does what is right is acceptable to him” (Acts 10.34).</div></blockquote>

<p> But we know that Cornelius himself admitted that full “salvation” needed more than his prayers. He needed the preaching and the message of Peter about Jesus Christ (Acts 11.13). The clear duty, therefore, is for every Christian to remember and then act on Peter’s teaching in Acts 4.12:</p>

<blockquote><div> “Salvation is found in no-one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.”</div></blockquote>

<p> That is why the Church at large and Christians individually need to tell others, in appropriate ways, the message about Jesus Christ. So Article XVIII of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England says it is wrong to say that </p>

<blockquote><div>“every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth … for holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Yes, missionaries tell us of people who are like Cornelius and just waiting to hear about Jesus Christ. Yes, Jesus seems to be able to judge how people would have believed had they a chance to respond to the gospel and that some would have repented (Matt 11.21). And there are other things that can be said. But as Professor F.F.Bruce wrote: </p>

<blockquote><div>“what if some will not repent? … If men choose irrevocably to follow their own way instead of [God’s] – if they say with Milton’s Satan, ‘Better to rule in hell than serve in heaven’ – they may do so but God has warned them of the consequences of their wretched choice. ‘In the long run, the answer to all those who object to the doctrine of hell is itself a question: “What are you asking God to do?” To wipe out their past sins, and, at all costs, to give them a fresh start, smoothing every difficulty and offering every miraculous help? But he has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what he does’ (C.S.Lewis).”The secret things belong to the Lord our God”</div></blockquote>

<p>How do you reconcile all these things together? The Bible does not tell us all we want to know. </p>

<blockquote><div>“The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us” (Deut 29.29).</div></blockquote>

<p> We do not know all we would like to about the Last Things. So we have to keep the balance of the Bible in respect to what has been revealed. Yes, there is a narrow door, through which we have to enter God’s kingdom and many seem to fail to do that. But we must be cautious of then saying that the number in heaven will be small. John tells us in heaven of </p>

<blockquote><div>“a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language” (Rev 7.9).</div></blockquote>

<p> And Paul says,</p>

<blockquote><div>“if the many died by the trespass of the one man [Adam], how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!”(Rom 5.15).</div></blockquote>

<p> And those “many” are not a minority. The 16th century Reformer, John Calvin, wrote: </p>

<blockquote><div>“if Adam’s fall had the effect of producing the ruin of many, the grace of God is more efficacious in benefiting many, since admittedly Christ is much more powerful to save than Adam was to ruin.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Apparently C.H.Spurgeon ( a great Calvinist) not only refused to speculate about the unevangelized, he also used to pray: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Lord, hasten to bring in all your elect, and then elect some more.”</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="AID (Anglican International Development for Relief and Change)">(January 2009) AID (Anglican International Development for Relief and Change)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2009</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Introduction<br><br>Following the GAFCON conference in Jerusalem in June 2008, the Archbishops of Nigeria and Uganda commissioned a team to visit the Province of the Sudan in late November 2008 on behalf of the GAFCON Primates' Council (this comprised Rev Canon Dr Chris Sugden, Rev Dr Vinay Samuel and myself). This was to investigate ways in which other Anglican Provinces might be able to establish partnerships with the Episcopal Church of the Sudan and to work together with the Church in addressing the many challenges associated with poverty that face the Sudan. This invitation confirmed a calling that GAFCON related churches in the UK were already sensing. So in response Anglican International Development (AID) for Relief and Change was established and has begun the process of developing such partnerships.<br><br><b>Rationale and “What will AID do?”</b><br><br>There is no need of another agency like the existing agencies. But there is need for an entirely different kind of agency. This is because a significant amount of money for Christian development agencies comes from local churches in the developed world. But agencies can then find it difficult working with local recipient churches. Inevitably they expect churches in the developing world to meet high professional standards in any development work. However, they do not necessarily see their role as building such capacity in these churches. That, of course, is a difficult task as development has to be understood from the perspective of the local church. Because of secular and other pressures, some agencies find this hard to do.<br><br>Churches, of course, are not development agencies. They seek to address poverty in their own way. Central to their approach is that a new identity, new hope for the future and new personal development - fundamental to any change in persons and communities - comes through the transforming gospel of Jesus Christ. Development carried out even by Christian agencies that is not primarily working with the Church, can cease to bear any significant witness to Christ. The Church, the bride of Christ, can become marginal to development activities. The gospel is then not at the centre of development activity. Also it is generally agreed by development agencies, Christian or secular, that churches, certainly in countries like the Sudan, are the longest standing of community organisations and are the most widely trusted of social groups by the poor. <br><br>With 30 years experience in the development field, people behind AID are seeking to address the above concerns. The organization is to be project focused in seeking to address poverty. The institutions it hopes to build will be the development departments of churches through capacity building partnerships. AID will not build itself. <br><br>Its initial pilot project has been a project for Christmas 2008 to support the Decade of Evangelism in the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS) through the provision of bicycles for pastors in the Diocese of Rumbek; and a number of churches have been asked to help. It is then hoped that major capacity building in ECS will take place through projects on children's education and health care; micro-finance development; and vocational training for young people returning from exile – these are all needs identified by ECS. To achieve these goals AID is planning to work with a development partner that enjoys very high regard among international development agencies for its professionalism. <br><br><b>The Episcopal Church of the Sudan</b><br><br>The Church in the Sudan has survived an onslaught since the 1960s of two wars totalling over 40 years of war. It is estimated that as many as 2 million have been killed. The Church has been able to survive because of the faith of its members. The testimony of Sudanese Christians has been that through the keeping power of God they have been able to survive terrible trials and traumas. The challenge now is to build on this spiritual capital and have a faith that leads to the “good works” of transformational development that addresses economic and social issues.<br><br>When Christians in the non-western world do development they need to do it in such a way that their own faith is not compromised. This means their engagement should build up, rather than undermine, a genuine concern for Christian ethics, discipleship and spiritual life. So AID recognizes and will try to strengthen this conviction and not impose a development agenda that is neutral about these Christian issues. For example, while enabling the Church effectively to address issues of stigma for people living with HIV/Aids, it will not ignore the Church’s own commitment to a Christian understanding of marriage and human sexuality.<br><br>Anglican Christians are about a third of the population of Southern Sudan. They have survived a determined onslaught by the overwhelmingly Muslim north to subdue them. After twenty one years of the last Sudan war an agreement was reached in 2005 giving Southern Sudan autonomy. In 2011 there is to be a referendum on the issue of independence or union between north and south. There is a desperate need for development on every front in the next few years. There is also a need for advocacy on behalf of Southern Sudan.<br><br><b>Bicycles and Bishop Alapayo Luctiel of Rumbek.</b><br><br>The Bishop writes as follows (edited and abbreviated):<br><br>“The Diocese of Rumbek in Bahr el Ghazal of South Sudan is one of the oldest and the biggest of the Dioceses of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan. It lies in the Centre of South Sudan and has borne the brunt of the Civil War that went on for 21 years.<br><br>In 1997 the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) overran the last stronghold of the Sudan government in Rumbek the headquarters of the State. Hence, the Diocese is wholly in the areas controlled by SPLM/A in South Sudan. This is a blessing in one way because the Diocese has complete freedom to carry out its Evangelistic duty without let or hindrance. In another way in the area of the Diocese any infrastructure has been completely destroyed in the course of the fighting thus leaving the people in abject poverty. Trade and commerce are non-existent because the transport system is in a state of disrepair. Car travel is a privilege enjoyed by very few people because fuel is brought and bought from neighbouring countries in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda)…<br><br>The Diocese is 80 km from East to West and 320 km from South to North. It has a population of over 250,000 half of whom are Christian. The other half has not yet heard the Good News of Jesus the Saviour.<br><br>The ECS has grown and expanded many times in a decade more than any time in its history in South Sudan. The Diocese of Rumbek is in the forefront of that growth and expansion. It had about 10 congregations of a few thousand in 1983; at present it has 273 congregations with an estimated Christian population of 130,000 - 150,000. These churches are based in the rural areas since towns were deserted.<br><br>With this expansion and growth of church membership, the (178) Pastors are assigned a number of Churches. The Pastor walks on foot long distances to conduct church services. Other churches go for months without the visit of a Pastor because of the difficulty of transport.73 Pastors have already got bicycles.<br><br><b>Objectives and goals</b><br><br>To provide each Pastor with a bicycle - to enable the Pastors reach those people who have not heard the word of Christ by easing the difficulties a Pastor faces in walking long distances (i.e. 105 bicycles).<br><br><b>Problems</b><br><br>The destruction caused by the civil war has impoverished the local people and the Church in South Sudan. The Diocese cannot raise any amount of money to purchase some of its needs in a situation where internal commerce and industry have collapsed. Bicycles and other essential items are bought and brought from abroad. The local currency is valueless and unconvertible outside the country. Local products cannot be transported to neighbouring countries for sale particularly from Rumbek Diocese. It does not border any country. It is in the middle of the Sudan.”<br><br><b>Giving</b><br><br>The mini-project for bicycles for Pastors (launching the partnership with the Sudan for Christmas 2008) has a target of £15,000. This is slightly more than the costs of the bicycles as it includes £1800 as a further gift for a congregation in Wau Diocese who have built the walls of a church but now need materials to add the roof.

                <p><b>Wall Street</b><br><br>After last September's collapse of Lehman Brothers in New York and the beginning of much global financial misery Andy Sewer (managing editor of Fortune) and Alan Sloan (also of the magazine) wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote><div>It's horribly confusing, not to say terrifying: even people like us, with a combined 65 years of writing about business, have never seen anything like what's going on ... How did this happen, and why over the past 14 months have we suddenly seen so much to fear? Think of it as payback. Fear is so pervasive today because for years the financial markets - and many borrowers - showed no fear at all. Wall Streeters didn't have to worry about regulation, which was in disrepute, and they didn't worry about risk, which had supposedly been magically whisked away by all sorts of spiffy noveau products - derivatives like credit-default swaps ... This lack of fear became a hothouse of greed and ignorance on Wall Street - and on Main Street as well. When greed exceeds fear, trouble follows." (Time 29 September 2008).</div></blockquote>

<p>This particular form of greed led to practices that seemed so easy and simple:</p>

<blockquote><div>If you borrow 35 times your capital and those investments rise only 1%, you've made 35% on your money. If, however, things move against you – as they did with Lehman – a 1% or 2% drop in the value of your assets puts your future in doubt.</div></blockquote>

<p>Why people have been so angry is that this greed saw people in finance companies betting "big with someone else's money," again to quote Sewer and Sloan; </p>

<blockquote><div>if you win, you get a huge bonus, based on the profits. If you lose, you lose someone else's money rather than your own, and you move on to the next job. If you're especially smart - like Lehman chief executive Dick Fuld - you take a lot of money off the table. During his tenure as CEO, Fuld made $490 million (before taxes) cashing in stock options and stock he received as compensation. A lot of employees, whose wealth was tied to the company's stock, were financially eviscerated when Lehman bombed.</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Greed and sexual immorality</b><br><br>As I was writing the above words, a journalist rang me to ask about Jonathan Ross. His BBCTV show was returning to our screens that evening after he had been having an enforced absence due to uttering obscenities (together with Russell Brand) on another BBC show. That such episodes are now, sadly, commonplace should not be surprising following the screening by the BBC of Jerry Springer, the Opera in 2005 (see Coloured Supplement April 2006). But also it should not be surprising that a culture of sexual permissiveness should go hand in hand with a culture of greed. <br><br>Such permissiveness then gives rise to various forms of sexual immorality and a sink culture in which communal effort is demotivated and people will not care about one another. Selfish greed will thrive. E.J.Mishan memorably writes that in a society made up of people who seem happy to tolerate a sexual free for all, an individual may well ask some questions: </p>

<blockquote><div>are these the sort of people for whose society he must stand ready to make sacrifices? ... Can anyone care very much what happens to a society whose members are continually and visibly obsessed with sexual carousal - to a society where, in effect, the human animal has been reduced to a life-style that consists in the main activity of alternatively inflaming itself and relieving itself?</div></blockquote>

<p> The clear teaching of the Bible is that there is an association of sexual immorality and greed. The Bible also teaches that this combination of  sexual immorality and greed will result in "the wrath of God". Paul writes in Colossians:</p>

<blockquote><div>Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming" (3.5-11).</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Be careful</b><br><br>Of course, we have to be careful. To suggest that the current financial collapse is God's judgment on human sinfulness, should not lead us to say that someone loosing their job or surrendering their home is because they are especially sinful. Jesus warned against coming to such a conclusion. He spoke on one occasion about a tragedy where people lost their lives and others were tempted to speak of their guilt. This was the collapse not of an economy but of the tower in Siloam:</p>

<blockquote><div>Those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them - do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish" (Luke 13.4-5).</div></blockquote>

<p>In that situation Jesus seems to be warning his audience of the fact that, in some way, all are guilty. So at such times we all should take stock, spiritually speaking, and check up on our own lives. We should ask ourselves whether we might be guilty of the very things of which we think others - the big "fat cats" in the banking world - are guilty. So Paul sees the need to warn believers of temptation with regard both to sexual immorality and to greed:,blockquote&gt;<i>"But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people"</i> (Eph 5.3).</p>

<p><b>What is greed (or covetousness)?</b><br><br>Greed in the Bible is sometimes translated as "covetousness". There are a range of similar words that the writers use but they all relate to the tenth commandment, "You shall not covet." This is the only one commandment (among the ten) that is about the inward sins of our thoughts as distinct from the outward sins of our words and deeds. It is referring to uncontrolled desires addressed to the wrong objects. And the commandment spells out some of these wrong objects as </p>

<blockquote><div>... your neighbour's house ... your neighbour's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour" (Ex 20.17)</div></blockquote>

<p>R.E.C.Browne writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>Covetousness is a dynamic state which is liable to explode into violent action but more often it stimulates plans to get the things so much desired. That is the course of covetousness in strong men. Covetousness in timid people shows itself in resentment, discontent, irritability and a readiness to belittle the possessor of the coveted thing or things.</div></blockquote>

<p>If greed, or covetousness, is a failure to control wrong desires, it is obvious that a culture that encourages giving in to sexual urges (as of right) and discourages sexual restraint, is unlikely to be nurturing a culture of deferred gratification in terms of wealth and possessions. Expect, therefore, greed and covetousness to accompany sexual laxity.<br><br><b>Contentment - the opposite of greed</b><br><br>Put positively the tenth commandment, prohibiting greed, is a call to contentment. So Hebrews says: </p>

<blockquote><div>keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.' So we say with confidence, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?'"(Heb 13.5-6).</div></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, this verse follows a call for "the marriage bed [to be] kept pure" and a warning that God will judge "the adulterer and all the sexually immoral." <br><br>So "fear" or being "afraid", Hebrews indicates, is not part of contentment. The world hopes that fear will exceed greed. That should then prevent the worst of the consequences of wrong or evil desires. Fears, however, cannot be lived with for long. Various forms of escape will be attempted sooner or later. Perennial favourites are drugs, alcohol and sex. But then expect an explosion, at some point, of those worst consequences. The Bible teaches that a consciousness of the presence of God protecting and providing is a saner and safer way of overcoming fear. This follows Jesus' teaching against fear or "worry" in the Sermon on the Mount. He taught that worry is useless and unnecessary. For, he said, "your heavenly Father knows" your needs, and if you trust him, he can be relied on to supply them as you "seek first his kingdom and his righteousness" (Mat 6. 27,32,33).<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Contentment does not mean the elimination of desire, as philosophies like Stoicism and religions like Buddhism seem to suggest. Contentment is the elimination of our selfish desires and the adoption of desires for God's will and others' good. That may, indeed, involve making money but honestly and responsibly, as Paul did through his tent-making (Acts 18.3). <br><br>Thomas Chalmers spoke of "the expulsive power of a new affection". He was referring to the knowledge of Christ's love for us which helps us redirect our desires so we put God first and others second and our own self-gratification last. Such "godliness with contentment is great gain" (1 Tim 6.6).<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Attacks on Christians and The Naked Public Square">(March 2009) Attacks on Christians and The Naked Public Square</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2009</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Fostering</b><br><br>On 7 February 2009 we heard in Britain of gross discrimination against Christians in the work-place. One paper reported that a foster mother has been struck off by a council after a Muslim girl in her care became a Christian: </p>

<blockquote><div>“The woman insisted that, although she was a Christian, she had put no pressure on the Muslim girl (who was 16 at the time) to be baptized. In 2007 she was asked to look after the girl, who had been assaulted by a family member. She told council officials that she was happy to support the girl in her religion and culture. But the girl, whose interest in Christianity had begun at school some time before her foster placement, also made it clear that she wanted to go to church. The carer said: ‘I did initially try to discourage her. But she said to me from the word go, “I am interested and I want to come.” The carer said that the girl’s social workers were fully aware that she was going to church and had not raised any objections. The girl had told her auxiliary social worker of her plans to convert before she was baptized and the social worker had appeared to give her consent. The council then told the carer there had been a breakdown of trust and in November removed her from the register. The girl has been devastated by the experience.” </div></blockquote>

<p><b>Nursing and teaching</b><br><br>On 18 February another paper reported that </p>

<blockquote><div>“new NHS guidelines state that doctors and nurses face harassment charges if they are accused of ‘preaching’ to staff or patients, while a draft code of practice for teachers could be used by schools to discipline those who discuss their beliefs with pupils.” It went on to say that “Caroline Petrie, a community nurse who is a devout Baptist, was suspended without pay for two months after she offered to pray for an elderly patient. Jennie Cain remains off work from her job as a primary school receptionist for sending a private e-mail asking for spiritual support [prayer] after her five-year-old daughter was reprimanded for talking about hell.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The good news is that Caroline Petrie is back at work having been reinstated. North Somerset Primary Care Trust now say that it recognized that Mrs Petrie had been acting in the “best interests of her patients”, that nurses did not have to “set aside their faith” in the workplace and could “continue to offer high quality care for patients while remaining committed to their beliefs.” The trust also admitted that, for some, prayer is recognized as an “integral part of health care and the healing process.”<br><br>In the light of all this (and more) Dr Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, said many Christians</p>

<blockquote><div>“have the daily challenge of living by a set of values that the world thinks are mad. ... There is no more urgent time than now to break down the compartmentalized thinking that separates trust in God from the world of work.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Fundamental issues and Richard Neuhaus</b><br><br>Cases such as these are very serious and deeply distressing for the individuals concerned. We should be praying for them, supporting them and supporting groups like the Christian Institute who can give practical legal help. But behind these presenting problems are equally serious issues for the whole of society.<br><br>On 8 January 2009 Richard Neuhaus, an American Christian and one of the great social analysts of the second half of the 20th century, sadly died. He came to fame in 1984 with a book entitled The Naked Public Square. The book had a profound effect in America and where ever else it was read.<br><br>Neuhaus’ concern was that people do not realize how fragile is true liberal democracy as a political system. It is not something that can be taken for granted. “In the longer reaches of history,” he argues, “liberal democracy appears as a curious exception to the various tyrannies under which human beings have suffered.” His thesis is that one form of tyranny is likely to occur when you have a naked public square - that is when religious belief, particularly Christian religious belief, is marginalized and excluded from public life being forced to be private. A secular state of this sort, where beliefs about the meaning of human existence are privatized, has then left in it only two public actors – the state and the individual. “Religion,” he argues, “as a mediating structure – a community that generates and transmits moral values – is no longer available as a countervailing force to the ambitions of the state.” So the naked public square is only temporary. It leaves a vacuum to be filled. In the West it has been filled with the tyrannical religions of relativism and secularity.<br><br><b>Subtle secularism and Martin Luther King</b><br><br>Neuhaus explains how secularization can be so subtle: “However many there are who actively promote a revolutionary re-evaluation of values, there are many more who quietly assimilate the dogmas of secularism. Among those dogmas, few have been so widely assimilated as the proposition that ours is a secular society. Even if it is acknowledged that historically our values were religiously based, it is alleged that that is a thing of the past. Religion may endure and be indulged in privacy, but it is no longer available for the reconstruction of a public ethic.”<br><br>He then gives as an example a broadcast way back in 1968 following the assassination of his friend, Dr Martin Luther King, the civil rights leader. “There was an ecumenical memorial service ... in Harlem, with numerous religious, political, and cultural dignitaries in attendance. The service was reported on television news that evening. The announcer, standing before St Charles Borromeo church where the service was held, spoke in solemn tones: ‘And so today there was a memorial service for the slain civil rights leader, Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. It was a religious service, and it is fitting that it should be, for, after all, Dr King was the son of a minister.”<br><br>Such blindness to the religious motivation and meaning of Dr King’s ministry, Neuhaus found astonishing. “The announcer was speaking out of a habit of mind that was no doubt quite unconscious. The habit of mind is that religion must be kept at one remove from the public square, that matters of public significance must be sanitized of religious particularity. It regularly occurred that the television cameras would be turned off during Dr King’s speeches when he dwelt on the religious and moral-philosophical basis of the movement for racial justice. They would be turned on again when the subject touched upon confrontational politics. In a luncheon conversation Dr King once remarked, ‘They aren’t interested in the why of what we’re doing, only in the what of what we’re doing, and, because they don’t understand the why, they cannot really understand the what.’”<br><br><b>Social senility</b><br><br>America (and the West – for Britain is now so like America) has lost its memory. One of the US founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson (not even a particularly orthodox Christian) wrote as follows concerning slavery:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties were a gift of God? That they are not to be violated without his wrath! Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever; that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is among the possible events; that it may become probable by supernatural interference! The Almighty has no attribute which can take sides with us in such a contest.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Neuhaus saw that “Jefferson understood that the naked public square is a very dangerous place. No constitution or written law is strong enough to defend rights under attack. Their ‘only firm basis’ is in their being perceived as transcendent gift.”<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The most serious problem in a secular society without a transcendent or religious point of reference is that conflicts of values cannot be resolved. There can only be procedures for their temporary accommodation. “Conflicts,” says Neuhaus, “over values are viewed not as conflicts between contending truths but as conflicts between contending interests. If one person believes that incest is wrong and should be outlawed while another person believes incest is essential for sexual liberation, the question in a thoroughly secularized society is how these conflicting ‘interests’ might be accommodated. Since the person who practices incest can do so without denying the rights of the person who abhors incest, the accommodation will inevitably be skewed in favour of incest.”<br><br>No wonder the Archbishop of York has responded last month by a call for Christians to stand up and be counted in the face of this growing illiberalism. May we heed his call. May we also thank God for the life and writing of Richard Neuhaus. And why not read The Naked Public Square? After twenty-five years it is still relevant.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Christian Hope">(April 2009) The Christian Hope</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2009</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>The current public climate, often generated by the news media, is one with little hope. Whether it relates to the late Jade Goody with her millions from reality TV, the fortunes of Newcastle United with relegation staring the club in the face, or the BBC with gloomy economic correspondents, there is a mood of despair. But despair is a mark of a society where you have widespread neglect of God and ignoring of the real truth about life and the universe as revealed in Jesus Christ and his Resurrection. This results in being Ephesians 12.2 … </p>

<blockquote><div>without hope and without God in the world.</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Dietrich Bonhoeffer</b><br><br>What a joy, then, to read again 1 Peter 1.3–5:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade - kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.”</div></blockquote>

<p>It was this passage that the distinguished German theologian and opponent of Hitler, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, read in the service he conducted for his fellow prisoners just before his execution at the Flossenbürg concentration camp exactly 64 years ago this month. <br><br>On the morning of 8 April 1945 Bonhoeffer was taken out to by hung for his connection with people involved in the 20 July 1944 plot against Hitler (the thirteenth film about which, Valkyrie, is currently on general release). It was, indeed, a particularly evil, cruel and lengthy form of hanging. Also before he died he sent this last message to his friend the Bishop of Chichester:</p>

<blockquote><div> “This is the end – but for me the beginning of life.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Such is the consequence of Jesus’ resurrection from the dead on the first Easter morning. You can have a <i> “living hope”</i> as Bonhoeffer had. That is the good news; and that is possible because it was a real resurrection with an empty tomb and Jesus meeting his disciples in a transformed, glorified body. <br><br>True, this was quite beyond human understanding. However, the disciples knew it was the same Jesus they had been with and learnt from over the past three years. [For more on the facts and truth of the Resurrection of Jesus see www.church.org.uk for the JPC Coloured Supplement April 2007]<br><br><b>Secular humansim</b><br><br>In his book Christianity: The True Humanism, Thomas Howard imagines someone just about to be executed like Bonhoeffer but being counselled by a modern secular humanist. He writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>“What do you say to the man in Death Row? After the Supreme Court, the Governor, and the President have turned down all the lawyers’ appeals, so that no hope may be summoned from any legal quarter, what will your word to him be? [For] tomorrow is the day … At this point we come to a watershed. If you are a nonreligious person with the courage of your convictions, then you will not demean yourself by mumbling insincerities about God being very loving and everybody entering into rest. Hope in this world has now gone for good. Is there anything encouraging you can still say? Indeed, the extremity of the situation will shine a terrible light back across the whole of experience, and force on you the question: Are all hopes, finally, illusionary? Is every hope a mere rearranging of the deck chairs on the Titanic while she sinks? If the point of view called secular humanism is true, then indeed this is the case. We as individuals are simply going nowhere.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Such secular humanism is the philosophy that is alive and well and being promoted in our schools, universities, government offices, civic centres, clinics and through the media. For the good of all this must change. It is not just being proposed but imposed. Who wants such erroneous indoctrination?<br><br>Of course, we must pray and pray regularly for change. Christian people, however, who have a living hope, also need to take whatever reasonable action they can to ensure that unrepresentative minorities are not spreading nihilistic negativism in our public life. Support for example, the Christian Institute [www.christian.org.uk] and keep informed.<br><br><b>Working for change</b><br><br>But change happens when, first, there is <i>“outrage”</i>. It starts with indignation about the status quo. It was said of one famous politician:</p>

<blockquote><div>“His distinguishing quality was his capacity for what can only be called moral outrage. ‘That is unacceptable,’ he said of many conditions that most of us accepted as inevitable … Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, prejudice, crookedness, conniving – all such accepted evils were a personal affront to him.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The opposite of such outrage is apathy. Apathy is the acceptance of the unacceptable. Leadership – and Christians will have to take the first steps in this change - begins when you refuse to accept the unacceptable. So there has to be <i>“outrage”</i>. The tragedy today is that in so many areas – moral, religious and political - there is <i>“the death of outrage”</i> (the title of a book). What is now outrageous is the absence of outrage! <br><br>Furthermore, a failure to see change may result in a culture of cynicism.</p>

<blockquote><div> "Cynicism – first cousin of that death-dealing disease of the spirit which the mediaevals called sloth and accidie – may be described as the disposition to believe that truth-claims cannot ever be trusted; that virtue, however apparent, is never real; and that hopelessness is the only real wisdom there is,” so ,” writes Howard. God save us from a culture of cynicism".</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The biblical gospel of hope</b><br><br>What, then, are Christians to tell the world?<br><br><i>First</i>, they can say that their hope, based on the Easter facts, gives them now great encouragement when life is dark or difficult; and it gives them great stability Hebrews 6. 18-19:</p>

<blockquote><div>God did this so that ... we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure</div></blockquote>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, they can say that the Christian hope does not lead to passive inactivity now as they look forward, but to positive action. Peter writes 1 Peter 1.13:</p>

<blockquote><div>Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed</div></blockquote>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, they can say they are looking forward to being with Christ forever. As Paul writes to the Philippians 1.21-4:</p>

<blockquote><div>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labour for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body"...</div></blockquote>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, they can say that their faith is nurtured through their study of the Bible (the Old as well as the New Testaments Romans 15.4:</p>

<blockquote><div>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope".</div></blockquote>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, they can say being hopeful produces goodness or purity. John writes 1 John 3. 2-3:</p>

<blockquote><div>Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure." </div></blockquote>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>So this Easter do not focus on the negativity and, literally, hopelessness of too much in our current culture. Rather, <i>"remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead"</i> (2 Timothy 2.8). And, finally, quoting the words of Paul in Romans 15.3:</p>

<blockquote><div>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit”</div></blockquote>

<p>.<br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Severe Logic and Predestination">(May 2009) A Severe Logic and Predestination</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2009</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>The following are some draft paragraphs from a book I am writing on orthodox Anglican theology. They indicate a difference between the English Reformed tradition of the Church of England and some other Reformed traditions. All Reformed traditions have been influenced by Calvin, the genius of the Reformation. This year we celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth. However, he was not “infallible”. We must learn from him as one of the great teachers of the Christian Church. But as a good Church of Scotland minister, Bob Fyall, once said, “it is a pity Calvin didn’t write the Bible.” All versions of Calvinism need, therefore, to be tested by the apostolic teaching in the Bible.</i><br><br>One of the marks of the Anglican (or the English Reformed) tradition is an absence of what has been called the “severe logic” of some of the other Reformed traditions. That is seen most clearly in the issue of Predestination and in <i>Article XVII </i>of the <i>Thirty-nine articles</i> of the Church of England compared with chapter III entitled <i>Of God’s Eternal Decree </i>of the <i>Westminster Confession </i>(itself a brilliant summary of a particular form of Calvinism and the confession of the Church of Scotland). You read in the <i>Westminster Confession</i> chapter III, section 5: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Those of mankind that are predestined unto life God (before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his will) hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature as conditions or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of his glorious grace.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This is saying there was not a foreseeing by God of who would believe and then predestining those people. No! It was a predestining that was all of God’s “secret counsel and good pleasure.” This, however, was not controversial. The English Reformers agreed, as did Thomas Aquinas and the Roman Catholic tradition. But you then read this in section 7 of chapter III:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The rest of mankind God was pleased (according to the unsearchable counsel of his own will whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth, for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures) to pass by and to ordain them to dishonour and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This is called “reprobation” – the predestining of people to death and hell. But our English Reformers do not affirm this doctrine in the <i>Thirty-nine articles.</i> Here is <i>Article XVII</i> entitled <i>Of Predestination and Election</i></p>

<blockquote><div>“Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour … As the godly consideration of Predestination and our Election in Christ is full of sweet, pleasant and unspeakable comfort to godly persons … So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation. Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Our English Reformers realized that you had to be very careful with the doctrine of Predestination. Pastorally, if presented wrongly, it could do more harm than good. That is why they were so keen to keep the balance <i>and proportion</i> of Scripture. So they said “we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture.” We are to focus on obedience to God’s clear will “which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God”. We are not to waste time on speculation into God’s “counsel that is secret to us.” It would seem our Reformers had looked at the Bible and did not wish to jump to conclusions about God's "hidden wisdom". But why?<br><br><br><b>Biblical balance and proportion</b><br><br><i>First,</i> the Bible shows that Jesus avoided talking about “double predestination”. In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats he speaks of the faithful believers who are “blessed by my Father” (Matthew 25.34) as inheriting “the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world”. But with regard to the unfaithful who are “you who are cursed” (yet with no mention of “my Father” as the curser), he speaks of “eternal fire prepared [<i>not for you</i>] but for the devil and his angels.” <br><br><i>Secondly,</i> in Romans 9, where verses 14 and following form a key passage on predestination, Paul says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath - prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory” (Romans 9.22-23).</div></blockquote>

<p>However, note one: “what if” – Paul hesitates about being dogmatic. Note two: God’s sovereignty in this section is clearly a sovereignty of mercy. God is withholding immediate judgment – “What if God … bore with great patience the objects of wrath.” Then note three: Paul explicitly mentions in verse 23, “objects of his mercy whom he [<i>God</i>] prepared in advance for glory”, while in verse 22 Paul does not mention God as the agent. Paul refers simply to “objects of wrath prepared for destruction” – not “prepared <i>by God</i> for destruction”. It is a simple passive. No agent is mentioned.<br><br><i>Thirdly</i>, in addition to Jesus and Paul, there is Peter who says in his first letter:</p>

<blockquote><div>“They stumble because they disobey the message - which is also what they were destined for [again there is no agent]" (1 Peter 2.8)</div></blockquote>

<p>Peter does not say their disobedience was “destined for <i>by God</i>”.<br><br>Now, of course, logically if God is sovereign over all, logic says there must be a double predestination. But Jesus and the apostles did not teach this. They did not deny it. They kept silent. There is a legitimate place for mystery or for us simply not to know. This side of heaven not everything is revealed, either by special revelation in Scripture or by general revelation through the natural order (as Psalm 19 verse 1 teaches some things can be). But sufficient is revealed. Paul makes this clear in 1 Corinthians 13: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part: then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known” (1 Corinthians 13.12). </div></blockquote>

<p>Our Anglican forefathers were conscious of the Old Testament truth taught in Deuteronomy: </p>

<blockquote><div>“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law” (Deuteronomy 29.29).</div></blockquote>

<p>Unlike some other Reformers, the Anglican Reformers were less “systematic”. They did not write great theologies as Calvin did. They gave us instead <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i> not a <i>Westminster Confession</i> which is a mini systematic theology and, indeed, has much to teach us. But as Griffith Thomas, the first Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, put it: “There is obvious danger in every attempt at systematizing Christian truth … it is far better to be content with ‘Articles’ or ‘points’ with gaps unfilled … This method prevents teaching becoming hardened into a cast iron system which cannot expand. It is the virtue of the Church of England articles that they … do not commit Churchmen to an absolute, rigid system of doctrine.”<br><br>Bishop J.C.Ryle saw this “over-systematizing” also behind the concept of a “limited” atonement where some reformers asserted that Christ died only for “the elect”, not “the world”. When commenting on John the Baptist’s statement in John 1.29 that Jesus is the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” and the claim that this does not mean the world but the elect, Ryle writes this: "I hold as strongly as anyone that Christ’s death is profitable to none but to the elect who believe in his name. But I dare not limit and pare down such expressions as the one before us. I dare not say that no atonement has been made in any sense, except for the elect. <i>I believe it is possible to be more systematic than the Bible in our statements.</i> When I read that the wicked who are lost, <i>“deny the Lord that bought them”</i> (2 Peter 2.1) and that <i>“God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself”</i> (2 Corinthians 5.19), I dare not confine the intentions of redemption to the saints alone. Christ is for every man” (<i>Expository Thoughts in the Gospels</i> John vol 1, pp 61-2 - italics mine).<br><br>This also seems to be the view of Cranmer. In <i>Article XXXI</i> we are told, "The offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone." <i>How,</i> in the divine economy, Christ died “for every man”, when tragically not all experience salvation, remains one of those “secret things that belong to the Lord our God.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="John Calvin and the 'Institutes of the Christian Religion'">(June 2009) John Calvin and the 'Institutes of the Christian Religion'</h2><ul><li>June 2009</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>To mark the quincentenary of Calvin’s birth on 10 July 1509</i><br><br>John Calvin was French. He was born a generation after Martin Luther, in Noyon, north of Paris. Calvin was eleven in 1520 when Luther’s writings put a match to the dry tinder of Europe and the Reformation fire took hold. <br><br>Luther called for a return to the Bible which alone is the unerring Word of God, a casting off of unbiblical tradition, and a rediscovery of the heart of the biblical gospel: faith alone in Christ alone as the ground of our salvation. All our religion and good works count for nothing on the Day of Judgement. We cannot save ourselves. God in his grace saves us. <br><br>This is the heart of the message of the Reformation. It became the heart of the teaching of John Calvin, as of all the great Reformers. Calvin had no desire to be original. He took hold of the baton handed to him by the first generation Reformers. He became the leading spokesman and teacher of the second generation. But essentially the message was the same. It was the message of the Bible. It was the gospel. <br><br>By the time he was twenty-three, Calvin had thrown in his lot with the ‘evangelicals’, who were increasingly regarded as subversive by the secular and religious authorities in France, and therefore liable to persecution, arrest and imprisonment. <br><br>One night in 1534 evangelical posters, proclaiming a reforming manifesto, were pasted up in key locations throughout France, including, somehow, in the antechamber to the King’s bedroom. The King was not pleased. He ordered thirty-two evangelicals to be burned to death. Calvin, by this time a marked man, had fled Paris only hours before his accommodation was raided by the police and his personal papers seized. <br><br>The details of Calvin's conversion from Catholic academic to fugitive reformer, totally committed to the evangelical cause, are obscure. Many years later, in a rare autobiographical passage, he wrote about that time: </p>

<blockquote><div>So it came to pass that I was withdrawn from the study of arts and was transferred to the study of law. I endeavoured faithfully to apply myself to this, in obedience to my father's wishes. But God, by the secret hand of his providence, eventually pointed my life in a different direction. At first, I was so obstinately devoted to the superstitions of the Papacy (and more stubbornly so than was right for someone of my age) that I was not easily extricated from so profound an abyss. Then God, by a sudden conversion, changed and shaped my heart towards being more receptive. Having received some taste and inkling of the true piety, I was immediately stirred to enthusiasm for it and, although I did not immediately put to one side all my other studies, I pursued them more spasmodically. But I was amazed to discover that, within a year, all those around with a similar yearning for the pure doctrine, came to me for assistance, even though I was only a novice myself. For my part, being rather shy and preferring tranquillity and repose, I began to look for some quiet retreat from them. But no sooner had I found what I wanted than, on the contrary, these places of retreat turned into public schools. Despite my wish always to live in obscurity and retirement, God so moved and transformed me through a variety of experiences and never left me in peace anywhere until, contrary to my natural inclinations, he brought me towards enlightenment and, so to speak, forced me into the open.</div></blockquote>

<p>That is worth quoting at some length for its intrinsic interest, but also because it illustrates important characteristics of Calvin. <br><br>First, the sovereignty of God, which is so central to his thinking, is not for him a theoretical and remote piece of abstract theologising. It is a practical biblical truth, which works itself out in the providential control of everything that happens, not least conversion. God converted him.<br><br>Secondly, his faith - his knowledge of God - was an affair of the heart, and not only of the intellect. “Then God”, he says, “by a sudden conversion, changed and shaped my heart towards being more receptive.” By “heart” he means his will, emotions, mind, indeed the whole of his being. Faith for Calvin is something all consuming. It is a fire raging in the soul, fuelled by the Spirit of God through his Word. No dry academic he, not any longer.<br><br>Thirdly, his exceptional gifts of leadership and teaching were evident to those around him from the start. He was not left alone. Whatever his personal and temperamental preferences, he came to realise that his God-given calling was to leadership in the church as a minister of the Word. <br><br>Fourthly, he was by temperament rather withdrawn and shy. The last thing he wanted was the limelight. Left to himself, he would have chosen a quiet life of scholarship. He had none of the ebullient wit and gregarious affability of Luther. But this does not mean that he was personally cold and unfeeling. He cared deeply for people, as his letters reveal. <br><br>A close friend of his, Etienne de la Forge, an evangelical in whose home he had lodged in Paris, was burned at the stake. He, like the other evangelicals who died, had been accused of being a radical anabaptist, politically motivated and with the intention of subverting the state and destroying the political order. Calvin was outraged by these suggestions that evangelicals were politically rather than spiritually motivated. “And”, he later wrote, “this was what incited me to publish my Institutes of the Christian Religion.” The book was completed in 1538. Calvin was twenty-nine. <br><br>It was not, except in outline, the book that it later became. This first edition was a relatively short handbook of the Christian faith from an evangelical perspective. It was intended both to show the untrue nature of the charges against the evangelicals in France, and also to be a useful summary of the basics of Christian faith and life for the believer. He says in the Preface addressed to the King of France, </p>

<blockquote><div>I am not afraid, in fact, to confess that here is contained almost the sum of that doctrine which they proclaim must be punished by imprisonment, exile, proscription, burning and extermination by land and sea.</div></blockquote>

<p>The book was quickly taken up as a valuable and well-written book that met the need, in a way that no other book did, for a portable but comprehensive and profound account of evangelical faith. It was a book, as T.H.L.Parker puts it, “whose sublimity was firmly related to the needs of ordinary Christians”. It sold out within a year. <br><br>For Calvin, it must be remembered, the persecution and suffering of the disciple of Christ for the sake of the gospel, warned about and exemplified by the apostles in the New Testament, was an ever-present reality. From the comfort of this country, we wonder how we would withstand open persecution if it ever came. For Calvin no imagination was needed. He felt very deeply particularly for his suffering compatriots in France. <br><br>All of his teaching needs to be seen in this light, not least his polemical writing against Catholicism and his concern that the doctrine of predestination should be taught to believers. For Calvin, a proper understanding of election and providence – God’s unchangeable choice of the believer, and its outworking in every circumstance of life - was a powerful source of solace to the hard pressed disciple. To soft pedal such teaching, or to neglect it altogether, was to deny the believer a major biblical source of comfort and strength. <br><br>Calvin continued to write prolifically throughout his life. His complete works run to fifty-five substantial volumes, of which the Institutes (in their final and greatly expanded form) are just four. <br><br>His first commentary was on Paul's Letter to the Romans. Why Romans to start with? He says in his introduction: </p>

<blockquote><div>... if we have gained a true understanding of this epistle, we have an open door to all the most profound treasures of Scripture.</div></blockquote>

<p>His Preface takes the form of a letter to a friend, Simon Grynaeus. In it he sets out key principles for biblical interpretation. He writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>I remember that three years ago we had a friendly discussion about the best way of interpreting Scripture... Both of us felt that lucid brevity constituted the particular virtue of an interpreter. Since it is almost his only task to unfold the mind of the writer whom he has undertaken to expound, he misses the mark or at least strays outside his limits, by the extent to which he leads his readers away from the meaning of his author. Our desire, therefore, was that someone might be found, ... who would not only study to be comprehensible, but also try not to detain his readers too much.</div></blockquote>

<p>He is very appreciative of the efforts of others, such as Martin Bucer, the leading reformer and Calvin’s mentor, but he says of him: </p>

<blockquote><div>Bucer is too verbose to be read quickly by those who have other matters to deal with ... he does not know when to stop writing.</div></blockquote>

<p>One might think that Calvin was not entirely immune from that charge himself. It has to be said, however, that he lives up to his own principles to an extraordinary degree. His target audience is always the ordinary Christian. His commentary is clear and sticks to the point, which is simply to clarify the meaning of the biblical text. <br><br>Eventually, Calvin settled in Geneva, where he stayed for the rest of his life. He did not find it easy. From his return in 1541, after a few years of enforced absence, up to 1555 he was in almost continual conflict in one way or another, attempting to reform the church and establish appropriate structures as he saw fit, but facing opposition on the city council much more powerful than he. Only in his last years was he invited to become a citizen of Geneva. For most of his ministry he was a resident alien, unable even to vote in council elections, let alone stand himself. What power he had lay only in persuasion. <br><br>Only after 1555 did he have consistent support, which came not least from the thousands of evangelical refugees who settled in Geneva as a haven of security and a centre of Reformed teaching. Then he was able to turn his mind more away from local concerns, to the wider needs of the Reformed cause in Europe, and especially in his native France. <br><br>Pastors were trained in Geneva and sent undercover into France to minister to the many Reformed congregations that were springing up despite the danger of persecution. By 1562 over two thousand French Reformed (otherwise known as Huguenot) congregations had been planted. Alongside all his other work, Calvin sustained an extensive correspondence with these churches, which were so close to his heart, as well as with a wide range of others across Europe, as his reputation as one of the leading teachers of the Reformation spread. <br><br>Let me give two snippets. In 1556 he wrote to a French church: </p>

<blockquote><div>I have heard that some are debating among themselves whether, if an atrocity is committed against them, they would resort to violence rather than allow themselves to be hunted down by brigands. I beseech you, beloved brethren, to abandon any such notions for they will never obtain God's blessing and will never succeed…”</div></blockquote>

<p>In 1561 he wrote to John Knox in Scotland, after Knox had returned from his exile in Geneva to lead the reformation there: </p>

<blockquote><div>... I am delighted, as you can easily imagine, that the gospel has made such rapid and easy progress among you. That violent opposition should have been stirred up against you is nothing new... With regard to ceremonies, I trust that you will moderate your rigorous attitude, even if you cause displeasure to many... You are well aware that certain things should be tolerated as exceptions even if you do not quite approve of them.</div></blockquote>

<p>Calvin's European-wide reputation and influence was founded above all on his greatest work, Institutes of the Christian Religion. This book, which expanded so much over the years, was completely recast by Calvin in 1559, into its final form. He reorganised the material and divided it into four books and eighty chapters from the previous twenty-one chapters. The first edition had six chapters! He also subdivided the chapters. So the book was given a much clearer structure and made easier to follow. <br><br>It opens famously with these words: </p>

<blockquote><div>Nearly all the wisdom we possess, that is to say, true and sound wisdom, consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves. </div></blockquote>

<p>Rather like the chicken and the egg, which of those comes first is hard to say. We cannot begin to know God if we do not have some idea of our own plight. And we cannot see ourselves clearly unless we have first “looked upon God's face”, as Calvin puts it. The rest of the Institutes unfolds what the Bible teaches about God and us. <br><br>Book One is entitled “The Knowledge of God the Creator”; Book Two, “The Knowledge of God the Redeemer in Christ, First Disclosed to the Fathers Under the Law, and Then to Us in the Gospel”; Book Three, “The Way in Which We Receive the Grace of Christ; What Benefits Come to Us from It, and What Effects Follow”; and Book Four, “The External Means or Aids by Which God Invites Us Into the Society of Christ and Holds Us Therein”.<br><br>It is helpful to see the Institutes as having a Trinitarian structure. So Book One concerns God the Father; Book Two, God the Son; Book Three, God the Holy Spirit; and Book Four deals with the Church. The structure broadly follows that of the creed. Alternatively, it is striking to note that Calvin was rewriting the Institutes at the same time that he was writing his commentary on Romans. If you know the flow of the argument of Romans, then the structure of the Institutes will have a certain familiar ring to it.<br><br>It is important to realise what Calvin is trying to do in the Institutes. It is intended as a guide to reading the Bible. So Calvin says in introducing it: “I can at least promise that it can be a key to open a way for all children of God into a good and right understanding of Holy Scripture”. But he not only wants it to be a guide to Scripture, he wants it to be tested by Scripture. So he says: “Above all, I must urge [the reader] to have recourse to Scripture in order to weigh the testimonies that I adduce from it.”  <br><br>J.I.Packer, in the Foreword of Bruce Milne's summary of Christian Doctrine called ‘Know the Truth’ says:</p>

<blockquote><div>For years I have been getting help from Calvin's 1559 Institutes of the Christian Religion [1500 pages], which from its second edition on was explicitly tailored to help Bible students and teachers in living and witnessing for God. It still does the job marvellously for those who can take it, but there is no denying that not all Christian stomachs can digest so mountainous a meal.</div></blockquote>

<p>It is hard to argue with that, though I would want to add two comments. <br><br>First, for its length, it is not on the whole at all difficult to read. Indeed, I have yet to find anyone who writes about Calvin's theology as lucidly as he writes himself. I agree with Alister McGrath: “To understand Calvin it is necessary to read Calvin.” Perhaps the marvellous chapter on prayer would be a good place to start. It has recently been published separately in a handy (and inexpensive) format by St Matthias Press. <br><br>Secondly, though I do not underestimate the task, I do not think anyone would regret time spent getting to grips with the Institutes. <br><br>It is built on Calvin's understanding of the Bible as the Word and (despite some modern claims about him to the contrary) the Words of God. “The apostles”, he says, “were sure and genuine scribes of the Holy Spirit, and their writings are therefore to be considered oracles of God”. But we cannot understand the Word without the help of the Holy Spirit. I quote: </p>

<blockquote><div>Indeed, the Word of God is like the sun, shining upon all those to whom it is proclaimed, but with no effect among the blind. Now, all of us are blind by nature in this respect. Accordingly, it cannot penetrate into our minds unless the Spirit, as the inner teacher, through his illumination makes entry for it. </div></blockquote>

<p>How can we sum up the teaching of the Institutes? Its teaching is, at the very least in intention, the teaching of the Bible. And how does Calvin sum up the message of the Bible? In these words: </p>

<blockquote><div>This is what we should in short seek in the whole Scripture: truly to know Jesus Christ, and the infinite riches that are comprised in him and are offered to us by him from God the Father. </div></blockquote>

<p>Calvin's Institutes went through over fifty editions in six languages before the end of the sixteenth century. It is the most influential single work to come out of the Reformation. <br><br>In his last address to the ministers of Geneva, Calvin said: </p>

<blockquote><div>I have had many infirmities that you have been obliged to bear with, and what is more, all I have done has been worth nothing... I have written nothing out of hatred of anyone, but I have always faithfully propounded what I esteemed to be for the glory of God.</div></blockquote>

<p>In his final letter, he wrote to his long time friend Farel: </p>

<blockquote><div>I draw my breath with difficulty and expect each moment to breathe my last. It is enough that I live and die for Christ, who is to all his followers a gain both in life and in death.</div></blockquote>

<p>He died at 8 o'clock in the evening on 27 May 1564. He was buried in an unmarked grave, as he himself had wished.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Education Today">(August 2009) Education Today</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2009</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>(The following is an edited version of an address given at the Grindon Hall, Sunderland, Awards Ceremony in the Sage, Gateshead, on 26 June 2009)</i><br><br>Education poses challenges for parents, teachers and pupils alike. It did in the case of Winston Churchill. Here is one typical school report: he is...</p>

<blockquote><div>“Constantly late for school, losing his books and papers and various other things into which I need not enter. He is so regular in his irregularity that I really don't know what to do. He had such good abilities but these would be ‘made useless by habitual negligence’.”</div></blockquote>

<p>However, his mother decided to put some pressure on the young Winston; and it worked. His leaving report, aged 18 was as follows: </p>

<blockquote><div>“His work this term has been excellent. he understands now the need of taking trouble … he has learned a lesson of life-long value.”</div></blockquote>

<p> A bad report need not be the last report!<br><br>But many parents today are not worried just about how children receive what is on offer at their schools. Nor are they worried just about how children acquire the basic skills of the “3 Rs” – Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic). They are more worried about what pupils learn – or don’t learn – about right and wrong. For many children are learning that right and wrong are just matters of opinion.<br><br><b>Jesus Christ, the definer of what is right and good</b><br><br>A parent (a university teacher herself) was recently telling how she discussed this issue with her daughter. At one point the mother said this: “Martin Luther King said slavery was wrong. Suppose there is someone who says slavery is good and we should bring it back. Couldn’t we say he is wrong and Martin Luther King is right and that slavery is bad, full stop!” Her daughter was stumped for a moment and troubled, but at last said: “Well, I think slavery is wrong, too. But that is just my opinion.” <br><br>At a Christian school, like Grindon Hall, things are much clearer. Its definition of a <i>Christian School</i> says: “It … means we … aim to have Christ at the centre of all we do.” And when Christ is at the centre, you have a reference point for what is right and wrong. You also have a reference point for what it means to have a good character. As responsible parents, we should be concerned with good character as well as seeing that our children one day can independently earn a living.<br><br>But what is “good character” and how do you get it? For Christian schools good character is based on Jesus Christ who the Bible says is “the same yesterday, today, and forever”. Christians believe that Jesus Christ not only reveals God to us but also what is truly human. And why do they believe that? Because, as the Bible also says: <i>“as to his human nature </i>[Jesus]<i> was a descendant of David”</i> (Rom 1.3). But – and this is the big “but” (it continues in verse 4)…</p>

<blockquote><div>“… through the Spirit of holiness [he] was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.”</div></blockquote>

<p>So Christianity is not just wistful thinking. It is based on reasons and reality. Christ’s was a real Resurrection. And the fact that Jesus Christ was seen really alive persuaded the early disciples of his truth and that he is, indeed, Lord of all. The remains of other world leaders remain in, or on, this earth. In Jerusalem there is an <i>empty </i>tomb. But if Jesus is the ideal for education, how do people become more like him themselves and avoid what is wrong? <br><br>First, a Christian school sees human wrongdoing as not just due to our upbringing. Fundamentally it sees it due to ourselves and the fact that men and women and boys and girls go their own way and not God's. And when you lose the fatherhood of God, you soon lose the brotherhood of man and are in trouble.<br><br>As children we were not born perfect. It was not our environment that made us bad. The bible says – and it is true of each one of us: “Folly is bound up in the heart of a child” (Prov 22.15). There is a heart problem. Of course we must work and pray for a good environment and the good upbringing of children. But Jesus taught that out of the heart (the inner self) come many of the wrong things that disfigure our world and our schools (Mark 7.21). So we need forgiveness and new hearts. The Christian good news is that Christ offers both – totally free forgiveness through his death for us on the Cross; and a new heart as his Holy Spirit works in all who trust in Christ as Saviour and Lord.<br><br><b>The British educational tradition</b><br><br>Some of you may be thinking all this is strange and something quite new for schools to be teaching. But this is mainstream and part of our British historical educational tradition. And it is believed around the world. A new best seller, just out, is entitled <i>God is Back</i> and the subtitle is <i>“how the global rise of faith is changing the world”</i>. The authors are John Micklethwait the editor of the <i>Economist </i>and Adrian Wooldridge, its Washington bureau chief. The book shows that getting back to religion and the Christian faith is normal. The abnormal is secular Western Europe without its Christian faith. Certainly <i>in education </i>the normal has been the Christian tradition.<br><br>The only schools available to our Anglo-Saxon ancestors were those provided by Christians. Here in the North East in the 8th century was one of the greatest centres of learning in Europe - at the monastery nearby in Jarrow. Later in the 9th century Alfred brought education to Wessex. In the late 14th century William of Wykeham founded a school at Winchester and then New College, Oxford. His aim, I quote, was...</p>

<blockquote><div>“...chiefly so that Christ may be more fervently and frequently preached, and faith and the worship of God's name increased and more firmly maintained.”</div></blockquote>

<p>In the early 16th century John Colet, Dean of St Paul’s founded St Paul's school in London. Colet said:</p>

<blockquote><div>“My intent is by this school specially to increase knowledge and worshipping of God and our Lord Jesus Christ and good Christian life and manners in the children.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Then came the Reformation and all the Edward VI schools – Edward being a champion of Reformed beliefs. In the 18th century Robert Raikes and others began the first Sunday Schools for poorer children to learn to read (especially the Bible) and to write. In the 19th century there were more church schools. Then in 1870 the State joined in. And in the 20th century there was the famous 1944 Education Act. But still the values and assumptions were fully Christian. Lord Selbourne introduced the 1944 bill in the House of Lords as the Second World War was drawing to a close. Speaking for the vast majority, he said:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The real enemy is naked materialistic paganism which has reared its head in Europe to a height unknown for a 1,000 years which threatens Christianity today and with it our civilization, our homes and our people ... Anglo-Saxon democracy would perish without the Christian ethic and unless we are brought up to be a God-fearing Christian nation, all our vaunted progress in other directions will crumble into dust.”</div></blockquote>

<p>And that would have been the view until the late 1960s and early 1970s in this country. Indeed, in 1973 one of the aims of the Newcastle upon Tyne Education Committee was, I quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>“To help the pupils towards an understanding of the Christian Faith in Jesus Christ as ‘the Way, the Truth and the Life’ (John 14.6) and to provide a basis from which they may move toward the belief that ‘Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing they may have life through his Name’” (John 20.31).</div></blockquote>

<p>But we are light years away from that now in our state schools. An anti-Christian philosophy has been allowed to have house room. Like the elephant in the tent it has squeezed out essential beliefs that have given us the British educational tradition. Yet 70% of our population still claim to be Christian. But I thank God that more parents are wanting to get back to that authentic Christian tradition for their children.<br><br><b>The continuing challenge</b><br><br>In 1954 Roger Bannister was the first man to run a 4 minute mile. As an old boy of my school he came to speak at our annual prize giving after this great run. We were not a Christian school as such, but the headmaster, introduced him, with a quote from the Bible – from Ps 147 where it says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“His [God’s] pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of a man; the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love” (verse 10).</div></blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is good to get awards for academic and other excellence. It is good to get world fame for being the first man to run the mile in under 4 minutes. But the most important thing in life is to have God’s approval as you honour him and trust him; and then to put your hope in his unfailing love which you see supremely in Jesus Christ. That is true for parents, teachers and pupils.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Old Testament Ceremonial, Civil and Moral Law">(September 2009) The Old Testament Ceremonial, Civil and Moral Law</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2009</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>

<p><b>Natural Law</b><br><br>We need to begin with the idea of “natural” law. This comes from taking seriously what Paul said in Romans 2.14-15:</p>

<blockquote><div>“When Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.</div></blockquote>

<p>Although human consciences may be seared, even among non-believers there is some awareness of God’s moral law. It is a matter of fact that when the Holocaust was discovered, there was a world-wide awareness of its actually <i>being </i>evil. This conviction was not just a matter of individual opinion. <br><br>The natural (or moral) law that comes <i>by nature</i>, or as the theologians say, through “general revelation”, is made clearer through "the Commandments which are called moral" (Article VII). These come through God’s “special revelation” in the Bible. And as believers also need this moral law as clear as possible, in the 1662 <i>Book of Common Prayer </i>the Ten Commandments, that provide a summary of this moral law, are to be read at every service of Holy Communion. <br><br>But how are you to interpret all this Old Testament law – the ceremonial, civil and moral law? That is where you first need to take note of Article XX of the Thirty-nine Articles and its statement that </p>

<blockquote><div>“… it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written; neither may it so expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to another.”</div></blockquote>

<p>You have to interpret the Bible as a whole.<br><br><b>The Ceremonial and Civil law</b><br><br>Before much of the New Testament was written and certainly before it became a canonical authority, it was evident to the early believers that the redemptive work of Christ meant the old sacrificial system of </p>

<blockquote><div>“the law … as touching ceremonies do not bind Christian men” (Article VII). </div></blockquote>

<p>This is clear from the Acts of the Apostles. Some already were probably treating the Temple with reserve. But Christ’s sacrifice on the Cross was decisive and final, fulfilling all that went before. This instinct was then confirmed by the letter to the Hebrews; and that soon became canonical.<br><br>It was also clear from the teaching of Christ that </p>

<blockquote><div>“the Civil precepts thereof [of the Mosaic Law]” ought not “of necessity to be received in any commonwealth [or State]” (Article VII).</div></blockquote>

<p>That is because the Old Testament has to be read in its historical context. It is, writes one biblical scholar, F. F. Bruce, </p>

<blockquote><div>“… anachronistic to judge Joshua or David by the standards of the Sermon on the Mount, or to think of Israel in the wilderness as a sort of Keswick Convention on the march.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This is relevant to small-scale problems like the prohibition of usury (lending at interest) to a fellow believer. It is also relevant to large-scale “moral problems” like the institution of the holy war or the “ban” (the <i>hērem</i>), seen, for example, in the total destruction of Jericho.<br><br>At one stage of the economy, when in a pastoral economy, that prohibition regarding usury was a protection to the borrower. However, in an urban economy when someone would be only too glad to borrow at reasonable interest to start a business, that prohibition would have been a hardship.<br><br>The “ban”, however, is more of a problem; and it is easy to be insensitive to the utter horror of what went on in attempting a theological justification. But equally the Old Testament warns, “Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker” (Is 45.9). The problem of the “ban” is the problem of all suffering (and needs a book to discuss it). But two things can be borne in mind. <br><br><i>One</i>, the New Testament problem (at least it seems a problem to Paul) is “why is there not <i>more </i>suffering, since God is a just God?” The sin of Eden leading to such terrible crime and cruelty throughout history and the world has not resulted in the ending of the entire human project as it nearly did in the days of Noah. But why not? It is due, Paul argues, to the sovereign mercy of God and his judicial act at Calvary which was for present, future <i>and past </i>sins (Rom 3.25). And, <i>two</i>, biblical revelation is progressive and cumulative. The divine character is clearly expressed in Exodus 34.6-7:</p>

<blockquote><div>the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.</div></blockquote>

<p>Our God, therefore, is “abounding in love”. So the Old Testament moves away and on from the “ban”. Jesus, in the New Testament, forbids his disciples calling down fire from heaven on their enemies as Elijah did (Luke 9.54). In the Garden of Gethsemane he made it clear that he would never be taking up arms. He confidently asked the question, “Am I leading a rebellion?” knowing that all would answer was “No!” (Mat 26.55).<br><br>It is clear from Jesus’ teaching, therefore, that “the Civil precepts” of the Old Testament law should not “of <i>necessity </i>… be received in any commonwealth”. So there is no need in Jesus’ time, or now, for any “holy war”. The extreme seriousness of the sins of the Canaanites that included child sacrifice was a lesson that only needed to be taught over a relatively short period of Israel’s history (Deut 9.4-5). And as there was no need for the “ban” in Jesus’ time, neither was there a need in urban settings for a prohibition of usury; indeed, Jesus seems to encourage investing money to earn interest (Matt 25.27).<br><br><b>The Moral Law</b><br><br>But not all is relative to the social context. Article VII says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.</div></blockquote>

<p>“The Commandments which are called Moral” which a “Christian man [<i>and woman</i>]” still have to obey are the Ten Commandments along with their exposition elsewhere in the Law and by the Prophets and in the other writings. <br><br>But these commandments must be interpreted in the light of Jesus’ teaching which made the spirit of the law trump the letter of the law. Jesus was especially concerned for God’s intention behind the law. In some cases it meant being stricter than current practice, in others more lax. So as  marriage and the Sabbath day were instituted for the benefit of men and women, they are both best observed when that original intention of God is promoted. <br><br>Jesus, therefore, saw that Moses’ concession on divorce and remarriage was for the “hardness of heart” of men and women. The Creator’s intention was the higher, but stricter, way of lifelong marriage (Gen.1.27; 2.24; Mk 10.2-9). <br><br>On the other hand, a very strict observance of the Sabbath, as some were insisting, should be modified in the light of urgent needs as happened to the law on “the Bread of the Presence” in David’s time when his men were hungry (Lev 24.9; 1 Sam 21.1-6; Mk 2.23-28).<br><br>But the principle of the moral law remained absolute. This is seen in the case in a Johannine recording of an incident where a woman had been caught in adultery. The Old Testament’s “commandment called moral” was upheld, but not the capital punishment of the Old Testament’s “Civil precept”. Jesus simply said, “Go now and leave your life of sin” (John 8.11).<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Assisted Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia">(October 2009) Assisted Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2009</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>medical ethics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The House of Lords and the basic Christian view</b><br><br>Over the summer there has been a serious development regarding euthanasia. It started with a bid to weaken the law on assisted suicide. This, however, was voted down in the House of Lords on 7 July. But at the end of the month (30 July) the Law Lords seemed to undermine the majority vote of the House of Lords by ruling in favour of Debbie Purdy, a former journalist suffering from multiple sclerosis and supported by the euthanasia lobby group Dignity in Dying. She wanted to know what would happen if one day her husband were to help her travel overseas to kill herself. Would he, on returning to the UK, face prosecution under the 1961 Suicide Act as someone who “aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another”? The Law Lords said Debbie Purdy had a right to an answer. One Law Lord even suggested that some assisted suicides ought to be “commended rather than condemned”. So on 23 September Mr Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP), listed 13 factors that would influence <i>not</i> bringing a prosecution. These include the helper being motivated by compassion; the deceased clearly wanting to die; and the deceased being terminally ill, severely physically disabled or suffering from an incurable degenerative disease. He then listed 16 factors that could mean prosecution. These include the deceased being under 18, the deceased being mentally disabled or the helper being motivated by personal gain. All this is serious because now doctors in the NHS are hearing that in certain circumstances they can, with no prosecution, decide to help patients kill themselves. But this overturns the entire Greek-Christian tradition of medicine that is life enhancing not death dealing. And how long before doctors will be <i>required </i>so to decide?<br><br>The basic biblical perspective over the taking of life is clear. God is our creator. Human life is not our ‘property’ - it is held in trust or on loan from him. We may not, therefore, just ‘dispense’ with it. As Job said: “The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away” (Job 1.21). Also, of course, there is that fundamental prohibition on killing in the Ten Commandments (Ex 20.13), and the basis for it is set out in Genesis 9.6: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; <i>for in the image of God</i> has God made man.” Our significance, and so our claim to protection, derives not from our "quality of life" or gifts and abilities, but on our status as being made in God's image. So suicide soon came to be seen as wrong in the Church. In the early church Augustine said it was like murdering yourself, so contravening the sixth commandment, “you shall not murder”. In the 16th century one of the Reformed Catechisms similarly said: “the sins forbidden in the sixth commandment” include <i>“all taking away the life of ourselves.”</i> But views have varied over culpability. <br><br><b><i>“Assisted Dying/Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia” </i>– a briefing</b><br><br>A very recent Church statement is the Church of England’s helpful briefing published last March and so before the Lord’s debate. It follows in full:<br><br>“While acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia, the Church of England is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice. The Church also acknowledges that those who seek a change in the law are often motivated by compassion and by a desire to see individuals treated with dignity and respect - motives that the Church also upholds. Equally, the Church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, but believes that assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals.<br><br>At the heart of this debate is the relationship between two important principles: personal autonomy and the protection of life. Often these principles are complementary but, at times, they compete for priority. The Church believes that personal autonomy has an invaluable role to play in a civilized society but autonomy ought not to be understood or exercised without regard to others. Autonomy ought to be ‘principled autonomy’. Our actions affect others both directly and indirectly and this reality ought to place boundaries on unbridled autonomy. In truly extreme cases, protection of life is sometimes impossible to achieve. This does not, however, undermine the importance of this principle or necessitate a change in the law. For Christians, the innate dignity and value of human beings comes from the belief that we are made in the image of God. It is not, of course, necessary to share this religious conviction to agree that every human being is uniquely and equally valuable. Without such a belief, society would degenerate into moral disorder with a social misapplication of ‘survival of the fittest’ replacing allegiance to our common humanity. Human Rights are built on the foundation of the ‘right to life’ as is much of the criminal code. Compassionate reactions to natural disasters and to the victims of war stem from a belief in the value of life. There ought always to be a ‘presumption in favour of life’ and where personal autonomy and protection of life conflict, protection of life ought to be given priority. Society and its agents ought to act to protect life and only where this is truly not tenable, such as in a situation of extreme violence or danger, ought this principle to be breached.<br><br>In assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia individuals seek the right to dictate how they may die, requiring doctors and nurses, as the agents of society, either to take life or to assist in the taking of life. Where a right is given, a corresponding obligation to respect, protect and to promote that right must also be acknowledged. A right for one must be a right for all and a right for all can only be upheld by society ensuring that every person has access to that right. An obligation on society and its agents to take life or to assist in the taking of life, by ensuring a universal right to assisted dying/suicide or to voluntary euthanasia, would create a new and unwelcome role for society.<br><br><b>Problems in practice</b><br><br>There are problems ensuring that any law permitting assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia could be sufficiently safe-guarded against abuse. Evidence from jurisdictions that allow assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia suggests that there have, indeed, been problems of ensuring that due process is always carried out and that adequate support services are always in place. As well as there being concerns that one change in the law will lead to further, greater, changes there is an inevitability that any law, however tightly formulated, will be interpreted variously by different people. A reference to ‘severe suffering’, for example, can only be interpreted subjectively while an estimate of how long a terminally ill person may have to live can only be precisely that - an estimate. Inevitably, doctors will vary in their approach and consistency will be impossible to achieve, with ‘wider’ interpretations of the law becoming acceptable.<br><br>Even with safeguards of mandatory counseling and ‘cooling off periods’ it is impossible to ensure that vulnerable, terminally ill patients, especially elderly patients without close family support, will not feel under moral, economic or social pressure to accept assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia. What may appear as greater freedom of choice for some can easily become a greater source of pressure for others. One such person is one too many and would represent an affront to them, to health professionals and to society.<br><br>It has been a source of comfort and assurance to millions of people that the NHS has provided care and protection as well as life-enhancing and life-saving interventions since its inception over sixty years ago. Trust in the health service is crucial to the health and well-being of individuals and of the population. To introduce assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia into the NHS (for only in this way could the ‘right’ be made universally accessible) would be to change fundamentally the nature of the NHS. The effects of this are likely to be far-reaching, particularly if assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia were to be perceived as being a ‘cost-effective’ way of dealing with terminal illness. Also the nature of the doctor and nurse/patient relationship would change fundamentally and irrevocably, if assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia were to become part of the ‘treatment’ that health professionals were to be able to offer their patients. Trust between doctor/nurse and patient is not always easily achieved; any change in medical or nursing practice in the area of care of the terminally ill is likely to have an adverse effect on such relationships. A ‘conscience clause’ allowing doctors and nurses to ‘opt out’ of assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia would often mean that patients would be introduced to new staff unknown to them at a most vulnerable stage in their lives, undermining patient care<br><br><b>Conclusion and the effects on Palliative Care</b><br><br>Making assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia ‘workable’ would require large resources, employing medical, nursing, counseling, legal and social-work staff with accompanying additional training and resources. With all of this, there is still no guarantee that assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia would be safely and fairly administered. In the mean-time, medical palliative care, which has been shown to be highly effective is still not uniformly available throughout the country. The additional psychological, social, family and (where requested) spiritual support services needed to address all of the needs of terminally ill people in a full palliative ‘care-package,’ are equally under-resourced. What is required is a commitment to making effective support a reality for all terminally ill patients. Suffering may be met with compassion, commitment to high-quality services and effective medication. Meeting it by assisted dying/suicide or through voluntary euthanasia, however well intentioned, is merely removing it in the crudest way possible.” Much more now needs to be said, but on another occasion.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Why this Nation Needs Local Anglican Churches">(December 2009) Why this Nation Needs Local Anglican Churches</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2009</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>reform</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><br><i>The following is an address I was asked to give at the Reform National Conference 2009 in October. There seems to be a growing conviction that Christian people need to be taking more of a lead in our public life, not only for the good of the Church but also for the good of our wider society. <br><br>I hope these considerations will be of help in our thinking as we look towards the future (and, of course, a General Election, in 2010).</i><br><br><br>(By way of a preface may I make this comment. “Why this nation needs local Anglican churches” requires us to focus on the Christian faith and the State in general, before we focus on local Anglican churches. I trust, therefore, that much of what I say will be relevant to people in all denominations. With that said, I shall attempt to address our question.)<br><br>In the first place “why this nation needs local Anglican churches” must be because God is real and Jesus Christ is risen and reigning and the members of local churches are the primary agents for telling this nation these facts and then the world “to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1.8). But there are other reasons which I need to elaborate.<br><br><b>WHY THIS NATION NEEDS … <i>CHURCHES</i></b><br><br>Dostoyevsky once wrote these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>“An ethical idea has always preceded the birth of a nation … and when with the passage of time a nation’s spiritual ideal is sapped, that nation falls, together with all its civil statutes and ideals.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This was written after his Christian conversion and truly prophetic in respect of what later became the Soviet Union.<br><br><b>Liberal democracy and the Christian faith</b><br><br>In Western Europe, with this nation leading the way but influenced by its dialectical relationship with the United States, the <i>ethical </i>ideal has been “liberal democracy”. The <i>spiritual </i>ideal that gave birth to liberal democracy is the orthodox Christian faith. That means the apostolic faith centred on Jesus Christ and the teachings of his apostles which you have in the Christian canon of Holy Scripture. When that faith is “sapped” as happened in Germany through the theological modernism of the late 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries and which Karl Barth exposed (when it was too late), the nation falls (as it did under Hitler). It lost its civil statutes and ideals. It produced laws that not only changed the doctrines of the Christian faith among what were known as German Christians (in contrast to the Confessing Church). But it also legitimated genocide, inhuman human scientific experimentation and the most “unjust” of wars.<br><br>I submit that we are facing a similar situation at the moment - a creeping, resurgent fascism. Do not be mislead. Fascism can be of the right or of the left. Fascism comes (some will remember) from the Latin, <i>fasces </i>– a bundle of rods tied round an executioners axe in the middle and carried for a magistrate. They would be used for corporal or capital punishment. Fascism, therefore, is simply when power is the final arbiter in public life. <br><br><b>God and Caesar</b><br><br>The State is distinguished form other social cohesions by alone being able to employ force to achieve its goals (Rom 12 and 13). The Christian tradition going back to Jesus is, however, that the State is not alone. There is God as well as Caesar (or the State) and every individual is accountable to both (Mk 12.17). Over the centuries Christians have disagreed about the precise nature of the relationship between God and Caesar and how that in practice is to be spelt out. But what all orthodox Christians have believed is that when either God or Caesar is eliminated, you have disaster long term. <br><br>When God is eliminated and there are no transcendent standards by which the State can be judged and to whom appeal can be made you have the State having naked power. This is known as totalitarianism and with modern science and communications it can be absolutely terrible (witness, Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot). <br><br>When the State is eliminated, you also have disaster. That is because those claiming to represent God can err in their exercise of “secular” power (i.e. power for this [<i>Latin</i>] <i>saeculum</i> [or <i>the age</i>] before the return of Christ). Such use of human power for promoting the faith is, of course, contrary to the teaching of Jesus and the apostles (Mat 26.52 – Gethsemane - and 2 Cor 10.4). Nor have the outcomes commended this use of power - witness 16th century Roman Catholic terror, the Reformation wars of religion (the Protestants were not all perfect) and modern extremist Islam, to say nothing of the former Yugoslavia, Northern Ireland and perhaps worst of all the so called “Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)”, now attacking Christians and others in the Sudan.<br><br><b>A creeping totalitarianism</b><br><br>So today we ought to expect, with the public elimination of God in the West, a creeping totalitarianism. We should expect it to start in a benign way but, if true to form, fear for the long term results. All that, of course, is unless we reverse what is happening which is my personal goal and I hope is the goal of all of us in Reform, of all the constituent groups in the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans UK; and, indeed, of all Christians of good will in the UK and Western World. In this country because of the way social change happens, I would expect this “creeping totalitarianism” to be a slow process. But it clearly is happening. We are very much aware of this at the <i>Christian Institute</i>. As a Trustee I see many confidential reports. I am convinced something has to be done. <br><br>But some of you may be thinking I am being hysterical. Look at the following: www.christian.org.uk/issues/2009/freespeechclause/jhvideo_22jun09.htm. You have there the case of Julian Hurst, a Christian minister <i>and police harassment for distributing an invitation card to Easter 2009 services</i>!<br><br><b>A philosopher’s analysis</b><br><br>It is not only committed Christian believers that think like this about these things. Here is the analysis of someone who is not a Christian; he is, however, a distinguished academic and philosopher:</p>

<blockquote><div>“It seems to me, we intellectuals have some genuine work to do. The loudest anti-Christian voices are among the intellectuals, and their arguments must be addressed. One of the tasks that I have set myself is to show, as best I can, that the liberal democratic tradition which we attribute to the European Enlightenment is a Christian product. It owes something to Moses Mendelssohn, of course, the father of the Jewish Enlightenment. But it owes far more to a tradition of thinking that goes right back to the beginning of the papacy, and which recognized secular government and freedom of conscience as the two pillars of social peace. Neither of those things is recognized by the Koran, which sees all law and all government as a matter for God’s regent on earth, and which allows free conversion to Islam but no free conversion in the other direction. The tension between Islam and democracy is not an accident of history. It reflects the deep opposition between Christian and Islamic views of the relation between man and God.Now it seems to me that the secular liberties on which our cultural and intellectual life depends would not exist, but for the Christian inheritance. And they would disappear tomorrow if that inheritance were ever to be suppressed. Just look at 20th century history for the proof. As soon as the atheist creeds of Marxism-Leninism and Nazism triumphed, all the liberties that the intellectuals treasured were extinguished. Look at the Muslim world today, where writers and thinkers are censored and sometimes threatened, like Naguib Mafouz, with death. Search for the secular liberties that we value anywhere in the world, and you are likely to find a Christian culture or a culture heavily influenced by the Judaeo-Christian tradition.”</div></blockquote>

<p>That is from the recent book of essays <i>The Nation that Forgot God. </i>And this extract is important for two reasons. First, this analysis, in much of what is being said, is so clearly right. <br><br>But, secondly, it is not right, I submit, in seeing the main problem as coming from anti-Christian intellectuals, presumably like Richard Dawkins. The writer probably has in mind books like the <i>God Delusion</i>, which is described by an Eastern Orthodox theologian as “an energetic attack on all religious belief,” with Dawkins as “the zoologist and tireless tractarian, who – despite his embarrassing incapacity for philosophical reasoning – never fails to entrance his eager readers with his rhetorical recklessness.” Many, and again not just Christian believers, would agree that that is not just polemics in return but a fair description.<br><br><b>The retreat of reason and green New Ageism</b><br><br>The greater problem, I submit, comes from those at the other end of the spectrum. It is the “retreat of reason” that we especially need to fear and not just those people claiming too much for human reason and science like Dawkins. There are three significant areas where this retreat of reason is evident.<br><br>The <i>first </i>is the retreat from science as such and not least from the science that intellectuals like Richard Dawkins are trying to champion. Listen to Patrick West:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The trust we had in science has … been corroded. Although its advances have helped us to live longer, healthier lives … many seem convinced that science is actually a malign force. Scientists are no longer people to look up to and admire, but to fear, through their unchecked ‘arrogance’, whether this be human cloning or genetically-modified ‘Frankenstein foods’. Nuclear energy is no longer regarded as the panacea, but, after the Chernobyl disaster in particular, as a pestilence. Acid rain, the Greenhouse Effect, the depletion of the ozone layer and the Brazilian rainforests: all are perceived either as the consequence of placing our misguided faith in science, or of our rapacious thirst for more consumer goods [which of course are the products of science and technology.]”</div></blockquote>

<p>So now in place of the scientific “arrogance” of people like Dawkins and their suggestion that science is the solution to every human problem, you have a “retreat of reason”. And this is often spiritualized into green and other forms of New Ageism. <br><br>There is also the memory of two world wars, the bloodiest in history, employing science and technology as never before; and there is also the threat of a nuclear holocaust. So these environmental concerns have built on those previous worries and concerns. And out of frustration or anger they have brought a new irrationality into our culture. In turn that new irrationality provides fertile ground for a <i>second </i>and even more serious retreat from reason. It is called “political correctness”.<br><br><b>Political correctness</b><br><br>Political correctness is an ideology that classifies certain groups of people as victims. Then it says these people need not just physical protection from physical attack. They also need protection from every sort of criticism however true and necessary. Furthermore it allows absolutely no dissent from these beliefs as this is such a primary value. And this <i>is</i> serious.<br><br>Political Correctness is an attack both on reason and liberal democracy. It is against reason because it is not interested in the truth. It is only interested in conforming to what is Politically Correct. It is against liberal democracy because for the first time in this country to a degree unknown since the Act of Toleration at the end of the 17th century some people are now afraid of what they say. They fear having legal action taken or losing their jobs for saying what has become politically incorrect even though what they say is commonly judged morally right. So when they try to establish <i>the truth </i>about certain subjects they fear being branded as “bigot”, “homophobic”, “insensitive”, “judgmental”, “racist”, “sexist” or some other such term. This is frightening and foolish. For the fundamental text for a liberal democracy is Jesus’ statement in John 8.32, “the truth will set you free”.<br><br><b>Multiculturalism</b><br><br>However, a <i>third </i>retreat of reason is multiculturalism (and more serious still). This is another surrender to irrationality and forsaking a concern for truth. For here the primary value is to hold all cultures equal with none to be preferred or privileged over another, however corrupt some or some aspects of them may be.<br><br>The full force of this came home to me after the Ayatollah Khomeini had returned to Iran. I was asked to give a lecture in one of the departments in the University of Newcastle upon Tyne on church and state issues. In the question time following the lecture at one point in answer to a question I said you could evaluate cultures. To illustrate my point I said I would rather live in Newcastle, where there was freedom for Christian churches <i>and for mosques</i>, than in Tehran under the mullahs. This was received with horror. In fact one of the students threatened to report me to the Race Relations Board.<br><br>In terms of simple human survival to ignore the social reality of the inequality of cultures or parts of cultures is suicidal. But too few seem to understand the implications of reckoning all cultures to be morally equal. If you hold that all cultures and (as you soon do) all ideas are equally valid and to be encouraged (when they are clearly invalid and to be discouraged), you actually lose respect for the people with these different views. That, of course, is if you are without a belief grounded in transcendental reality as the basis for respect, namely that all men and women are created in the image of God (Gen 1.27).<br><br><b>Norman Dennis and the loss of respect</b><br><br>Norman Dennis, the former Reader in Social Science in the University of Newcastle writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Respect [for views] … is neither necessary nor possible; it is simply irrelevant, if all views of the world are equally valid. If all views of the world are equally true and equally good, then one set of people can feel only indifference if the effects on them of the world-view of another set of people are neutral; pleasure if they are beneficial; and defiance, hatred, fear or helplessness if they are oppressive.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Without reasonable argument over the merits or demerits of claims to truth or value, what is left but emotions? Of course we want a genuine celebration of cultural difference. At Jesmond Parish Church we had on Sunday our International Welcome Service. The church was hung with flags from the nations of church members and visitors, who literally come from all over the world. We are a totally multicultural church. Our staff is multicultural. We have on it an Arab, a mainland Chinese, a Malaysian, a Nigerian and a Sri Lankan. We treat everyone the same and are generally unaware of national backgrounds. That is the culturalism I want – mono-culturalism on primary issues, because we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on basic beliefs, with multi-culturalism on secondary issues.<br><br><b>The BBC and Westminster</b><br><br>I heard a presenter on the BBC two Sundays ago suggesting that you could never talk about the superiority of one culture over another. Genuine asylum seekers would think he was mad! But the MP he was interviewing did not contradict him. No wonder there is disillusionment with the BBC and current Westminster Politics and Politicians. By talking like this ground is given to extreme racist groups. <br><br>Most in this country do not want as MPs those who think female circumcision, honour killings, sharia law in all its outworkings and the execution of adulterers, converts to Christianity and homosexuals should be celebrated. In the same way they do not want MPs to celebrate (as a number of TV producers do) all the British disgusting drunken and orgiastic behaviours you are now getting amongst the elites in universities; amongst the not so elite on Friday and Saturday nights in city centres and then in the ANE departments of major hospitals at huge cost to the public purse; and amongst all sorts when the British are on holiday in the Mediterranean. But by not having a genuinely open society where argument is once again possible, to be seen to be privileging one world-view is now the worst of crimes.<br><br><b>John Milton and John Locke</b><br><br>Under a truly liberal democracy all groups may be publicly tolerated so long as they are not seditious, grossly sexually immoral or violent. But toleration does not imply celebration. Toleration means disagreeing with something but not punishing it.<br><br>British and world-wide liberal democracy was forged, after the 17th century wars of religion, by men like John Milton who argued for a free press. And so in 1694 Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act and prepublication censorship came to an end. Macaulay described this as a greater contribution to liberty and civilization than either the Magna Carta or the Bill of Rights. However, publications were still subject to the laws of the land regarding sedition, blasphemy, obscenity and libel. But ideas were free. That is the essence of liberalism. So men like John Locke, another Puritan or, rather, ex-Puritan, worked out these ideas of freedom for public political order. His famous <i>Letters of Toleration </i>beginning in 1689 were seminal. In essence he argued that the State must never use force to enforce ideas or beliefs. Ideas or beliefs must be free. However, not all behaviours could be free – sedition, certain sexual immorality (in those days it would have been the open sex of some Anabaptist groups) and violence had to be opposed.<br><br>All civilized societies have to have these limits. No society can cohere without attacking sedition, without some restraint on sexual behaviour and without the outlawing of the use of force except by the recognized statutory authority – the State. Currently in Britain the State follows that agenda of Locke by disciplining sedition; gross sexual immorality (but only rape and sex with the very young); and violence.<br><br>But how have we got to where we have got? There are two factors.<br><br><b>A weird theological process</b><br><br>There has been a weird theological process going on. First, there is a right concern for the marginal and minorities that is rooted in the Christian tradition. The Bible shows a concern for orphans, widows and “the alien within your gates” (Ex 20.10). Secondly, however, the result has been that terms such as “minorities” and “the marginal” have high moral status. But when this concern for the minorities and marginal gets into legislation these minorities claim to have a “right” not to be affected by the beliefs, symbols and rules of the majority Christian-influenced culture. That then gives further status to these divergent cultures which may, in some respects be contradictory to the majority culture. But once legally protected they then make the majority culture that worked for their protection seem like just “another culture”, even though it is a majority culture. <br><br>And because there is a retreat of reason, it is not possible to argue that the only way divergent cultures can possibly coexist long term is under a Christian canopy and with an acceptance of Lockean principles. For this alone can secure, long term, the true freedom they enjoy. <br><br>This freedom of ideas and beliefs, of course, is underwritten by the Christian doctrine of hell. If God allows humankind to reject him and his purposes, no man should force another to submit to God. So what you have had in Britain since John Locke, has been a <i>subordinate </i>pluralism, for it is under a Christian canopy. The same has been true in the United States though less visibly.<br><br><b>An open society, a Christian canopy and Francis Schaeffer</b><br><br>In an open society under a Christian canopy it is assumed that other people’s actions or the views they hold or promulgate are “open” to challenge by reasoned argument. That is the only permitted method of proposing or opposing them. They must never be imposed. Manipulation, coercion, intimidation and lies are ruled out. In an open society where there is no retreat of reason, people listen to an opponent’s case with a readiness to learn: there may be something to be learned. But they try to treat their opponent’s case as sufficiently important to want to correct it, where they believe it to be factually distorted, or morally or spiritually mistaken. They treat both their own view of the world <i>and that of their opponent </i>seriously - that is to say, with respect. So in a healthy democracy criticism should be a regular public activity. In the words of Michael Walzer, “The democratic rule is: criticize, and pay attention to the criticism of others.”<br><br>We are in critical times that need <i>our </i>criticism. However, we should not blame the Parliamentarians or even the biased journalists who are retreating from reason into varieties of political correctness and multiculturalism. So who is to blame? It is us! In 1984 Francis Schaeffer - an influential Christian leader - said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“It is my firm belief that when we stand before Jesus Christ, we will find that it has been the weakness and accommodation of the evangelical group on the issues of the day that has been largely responsible for the loss of the Christian ethos which has taken place in the area of culture in our own country over the last forty to sixty years.”</div></blockquote>

<p>He was referring to America in the first half of the 20th century. I fear the same could be said about “the evangelical group” in this country, regarding the past forty to sixty years. We are talking about the sin of omission. We haven’t taught as we should; we haven’t organized as we should; and we haven’t acted as we should – all to which must return. <br><br>But first we must ask, why this nation needs Anglican churches.<br><br><b>WHY THIS NATION NEEDS … <i>ANGLICAN </i>CHURCHES</b><br><br>It should be clear now why the nation needs churches. Why, however, does it need <i>Anglican </i>churches?<br><br><b>Biblical balance</b><br><br><i>First</i>, I think that the English Reformed tradition is biblically balanced. In this year of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Charles Simeon, I can say that at heart I am a Simeon Christian with a concern for this balance. I have argued “why?” at an earlier Reform Conference. The talks are recorded.<br><br>Simeon said that he went to the Bible basically to find out what the apostles taught rather than to teach them what they should have said. That is my essential theology along with the comment, from Bob Fyall, a Church of Scotland minister, “It is a pity Calvin didn’t write the Bible”. And that, as I understand it, is at the heart of true Anglicanism. <br><br>It is sufficiently systematic without being too systematic. At the end of the day the Bible has to trump systems. So Anglicanism has 39 Articles with gaps, rather than a Calvinistic Westminster Confession. Simeon believed you could be more systematic than the Bible. That, I believe, also is truly Anglican. <br><br><b>Moderate Calvinism</b><br><br>Anglicanism is moderate Calvinism which also recognizes that although Milton and Locke were wrong over a number of things, they were right in a number of their political judgments. So too were Wilberforce, Shaftesbury and Josephine Butler to name just three from the 19th century. But this has to be Anglicanism defined by Canon A5 and not by its bishops or institutional forms (i.e. synods). At law, of course, Canon A5 is the canon of canons as the <i>Worship and Doctrine Measure 1974 </i>makes clear. Canon A5 says: the doctrine of the Church of England...</p>

<blockquote><div>“... is grounded in the Holy Scriptures and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular, such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal.”</div></blockquote>

<p>So the answer to “why <i>Anglican </i>churches?” is that its established theology is sound.<br><br><b>The establishment</b><br><br><i>Secondly</i>, the Anglican Church in England is particularly well suited to fulfilling a role in the nation. This is because of its establishment. <br><br>The words “by law established” were originally used to denote the statutory process by which the allegiance of the Church of England to the Sovereign (and not the Pope) and the forms of worship and doctrines of the church were imposed by law. The phrase distinguished the legality of the national church from other churches which were then unlawful, with their worship and doctrines being proscribed. <br><br>But now that distinction has disappeared, for all churches have legal status. A number began to have it following the Toleration Act of 1689 - the year of Lock’s first Letter. However, the Church of England is the <i>national </i>church because it is bound by more of the law and more of the national constitution than are other churches and, in return, has some privileges. That is a given. Until the country at large does not want that establishment, I judge it would be foolish to disengage. <br><br>Certainly the establishment can be reformed. Never forget that the Church of Scotland, without bishops, is established and still the national church in Scotland and also without the Queen as its supreme governor. Time forbids me to say what I think can, and should, be done to improve the establishment position, except to say that I quite agree with the Reform Covenant in its concern to see not a removal but a reform of the episcopate.<br><br><b>WHY THIS NATION NEEDS <i>LOCAL </i>ANGLICAN CHURCHES</b><br><br>But why does the nation need <i>local </i>Anglican churches. This is where the rubber really hits the road.<br><br><b>A peaceful Christian uprising</b><br><br>I believe that the situation in England is so serious that there needs to be something of a peaceful Christian uprising of the sort we witnessed in 1989 in Eastern Europe to end the terrible years of Soviet tyranny. Christians played a significant role in the “velvet” revolution in a number of countries.<br><br>I was privileged to be a British representative at the inauguration of the Evangelical Alliance of Romania immediately after the overthrow of Caucesceau. Many of the leaders of the movement for change in that country were Evangelical Christians. A number had suffered terrible persecution. Some will remember Pastor Wurmbrand. But an uprising is related to a revitalization movement. Such movements are not only movements like the great religious awakenings in America and the Wesleyan and Evangelical revivals in England. They also include uprisings such as these that resulted in 1989 in the demise of totalitarian Communism. Such movements require three things. <br><br><b>Revitalization movements</b><br><br><i>First</i>, leaders who articulate clearly the crisis and embody the beliefs followers share. However, these leaders can be either transformatory or reactionary. I quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Revitalization moves beyond reaction only when these movements include adherents who are willing to experiment with new cultural forms [we would say “new wine skins”].</div></blockquote>

<p>For the Church of England that at least means seeing parishes in terms of duties rather than rights. So we recognize we have a duty thoroughly to evangelise our own parishes but without rights that exclude others. It involves both Church planting and developing mega-churches (or perhaps a better term for England, “minster churches”).<br><br><i>, there also need to be new patterns of communication. Certainly the internet has provided such new patterns. At Jesmond we now have established Christian TV (at www.clayton.tv). Our weekly <i>Sunday Service </i>programme is also broadcast on Sky channel 586 (the UCB channel) at 8.30 am on Sundays and repeated at 12.30 pm on Mondays.<br><br>And <i>thirdly</i>, there needs to be a transformation of consciousness; and this involves three distinct dimensions.<br><br><b>A transformation of consciousness</b><br><br><i>One</i>, there have to be <i>personal processes</i>. In Christian terms this has to be conversion and Christian living. <i>Two</i>, there need to be, in the jargon, <i>local communities of reference</i>. These are people who see the way you see things. In Christian terms they are orthodox biblical churches. And <i>three</i>, there need to be more <i>that are supportive of the new vision. This relates to the wider culture and community in which individual supporters find themselves. Both the wider church and, most importantly, the nation itself are such structures. That is why we cannot ignore either our wider connections or these political issues.<br><br>All this is common sense. If someone is converted to Christ, they need the support of a local fellowship of believers. But on Monday morning they do not want their work-place with its culture and mores hostile to their new found faith. In the light of this thinking on revitalization at Jesmond Parish Church in Newcastle upon Tyne, we have a threefold vision statement of <i>Godly Living, Church Growth </i>and <i>Changing Britain: Godly Living </i>(trusting in Christ and obeying the word), <i>Church Growth </i>(telling the world and serving the church) and <i>Changing Britain </i>(caring for needs and contending for truth).<br><br><b>The need for the local</b><br><br>So that is why we, and the nation, need local Anglican churches. Unless the church is local, it is not real. The local church is where the relevant teaching has to take place – not in Synods; they help if they can. And the first teaching needs to be as ever on evangelism and evangelistic and calling the nation back to God and repentance. That of course involves individuals in the local churches repenting for the failure to get to grips with these wider issues. They need to understand these corporate implications of their faith as part of their discipleship. And we have to recover the Pauline conception of the State that it is not just negative, to restrain evil; it is also to encourage the good. So <i>the use of force </i>while the instrument of the State should not be the goal of the State. That should be to encourage the good (Romans 13.4).<br><br>We are in this current serious situation in the West partly because of a political philosophy introduced by Isaiah Berlin the first month I was an undergraduate at the University in 1958. But that was against this teaching of Paul. It was his inaugural lecture as a new professor and entitled <i>Two Concepts of Liberty</i>. He was referring to negative and positive liberty – “freedom from” and “freedom for”. He argued that to structure a society with “freedom for” was the way to an abuse of power and a curtailment of people’s negative liberties – their “freedom from” doing what they did not want to do. When a political leader believes his policies are the key to a better future, this end too often is used to justify brutal means. He had in mind Stalin. This was his argument.<br><br><b>Isaiah Berlin and <i>Two Concepts of Liberty</i></b><br><br>Isaiah Berlin’s Political Philosophy wore well in the Cold War years. And other philosophers since have followed in Berlin’s footsteps, especially John Rawls, a very influential political philosopher. They have taught that no States should propose, or have a view about, a particular version of “the good life”. That would be on the side of positive “freedom for”. <br><br>So every one must be free to choose their own interpretation of the good life and so free to choose against any other person’s view – “freedom from”. <br><br>Hence the privatization of all religion and morality. That is the way, they taught, to live harmoniously in pluralistic societies where there are many versions of what is good. We, I hope, have now seen how wrong this is. The good news is that political philosophers are now arguing against Berlin and Rawls. In fact, both men changed their own ideas before they died (fairly recently). Political philosophers are now arguing we must have <i>some </i>“freedom for”. Otherwise dreadful philosophies will fill the vacuum; or States will find themselves at the whim of their leaders and you have, as here in the UK, creeping totalitarianism.<br><br><b>The Christian world-view and Christian responses</b><br><br>But what should be taught and encouraged in the local churches in addition to evangelizing and reminding people of Romans 13.4? There are seven things at least.<br><br><i>One</i>, that the Church – which means people in the local church - needs to help maintain that sacred canopy, not necessarily by engaging in politics but by teaching relevantly and publicly the four cardinal truths as a grid for analyzing all social problems. These convictions are as follows. <br><br>First, that God is our creator and we are his creatures – so that is from where we gain our meaning, significance and rights – not from the State; secondly, that humankind is fallen and so needs redeeming; that is why the state is limited in what it can achieve (so how dreadful are all the utopian speeches you hear at political party conferences); thirdly, that Christ came as the redeemer and saviour through his cross and resurrection; and that truth is so essential for the good life – so say it more and more publicly; and, fourthly, that Christ will come again one day, this time to judge the world. <br><br>We should not be apologetic in communicating those truths.<br><br><i>Two</i>, that church members need an engagement in public life, which must not be equated with political life. The Public Square is larger than Parliament Square and includes all those intermediate social cohesions, supreme among which are marriage and the family which the State needs to protect. At the lowest level this engagement means a simple love for your neighbour and the care for those who suffer. <br><br><i>Three</i>, that when overtly moral and spiritual issues are being canvassed, the Christian should be seeking to steer things in accordance with Christian truth. So make use of the <i>Christian Institute.</i><br><br><i>Four</i>, that Christians should also live positively for Christ each day at work or at home and vote responsibly. <br><br><b>Politics and prayer</b><br><br><i>Five</i>, that they should not dictate <i>means </i>to the politicians (unless some particularly wrong means are proposed). Rather they should seek to teach about <i>ends</i>. To illustrate this point the bridge analogy is helpful. A Christian can say it is right to build a really safe bridge; but the engineer has to come up with a safe design. In the same way Christians should seek to tell politicians what ends a social order should promote. They must leave the politicians to work out the means. <br><br><i>Six</i>, that the three ends that the former Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, advocated are fundamentally biblical and to be remembered. They are freedom, fellowship and service (and Temple wanted “freedom for”). He wanted <i>freedom </i>for countering a collectivist state; he wanted <i>fellowship</i> to counter a wrong individualism; and he wanted service to contribute to the common good, focusing on duties rather than rights..<br><br>But what should be taught and encouraged in the <i>seventh</i> place (and with this I conclude) is that before anything else the local church should be praying (1 Tim 2:1-2): </i></i></p>

<blockquote><div>“I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone - for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.” </div></blockquote>

<p><b>Concluding question</b><br><br>It is black and white. This is the first duty for a local church – praying for the nation and all these issues, says Paul. But is that the priority for our praying in our local churches? I fear often the answer will be “No”. Surely that indicates where this peaceful uprising and revitalization has to begin.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="'The Noughties" and the Manhattan Declaration">(January 2010) "The Noughties" and the Manhattan Declaration</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2010</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>liberalism</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>2000 – 2009</b><br><br>What will the decade 2000-2009 (“the noughties”) be remembered for? Many would say for positive developments in science and technology, especially digitalized communication technology - mobile phones, digital cameras and all the applications of the broadband internet. Others would say “the noughties” will be remembered more negatively for 11 September 2001 when Muslim terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Centre in New York, and for the resurgence that followed of a violent form of Islam with more terrorist attacks in Madrid with the train bombings in 2004; in London with the 7/7 bombings in 2005; and in Mumbai with the attacks of 2008. Then, of course, yet others will remember the decade for the recent recession and many who suffered for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake with its massive tsunami – the second most destructive earthquake of all time.<br><br><b>Assault on Christianity</b><br><br>However, many Christians in the West would say this past decade will be remembered as the time when they first realized that the Christian faith was being marginalized by a relative minority of elites in the media, the educational empire, the therapeutic services and sections of local and central government, who were also succeeding in entrenching their secular prejudices and intolerance in law. So, late in the day, Christians came to realize that there is now a world “increasingly bent,” in the words of one Christian journalist, “on compelling not merely our silence but ultimately our participation in its sins, crimes, and follies—its pornographies, infanticides, and redefinitions of human nature.” And the problem, he goes on to argue, is that “too many of the churches are giving in.” Rather they should fulfil their duty…</p>

<blockquote><div>“to stand up before their cultured despisers and say what must be said by those who believe it: that faith in Jesus Christ is the cure for the diseases of our time, that all human beings are endowed with the dignity and worth of having been made in God’s image, and that the universal truths established by God at the foundation of the world remain the universal truths of human existence today.”</div></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Liberal democracy</b><br><br>In a truly liberal democratic society Christians must be free to speak and to work without violating their consciences; and their churches must be free to proclaim the gospel and, when necessary, denounce sin. They must also be able to form charities to help the vulnerable and here of all places they should not have to violate their consciences. And most certainly they must be free to educate their children as they believe is right. <br><br>Perhaps we should pray, therefore, that “the noughties” will be remembered as ending with a new Christian mood that will last and illustrated by the <i>Manhattan Declaration</i>. A significant number of American Christian leaders (plus Jim Packer from Canada) agreed and signed this during Autumn 2009 in the light of the situation now in the US (and Canada) which is so similar to that in Europe. The summary of the declaration follows and speaks for itself.<br><br><b>THE MANHATTAN DECLARATION – a summary</b><br><br>“Christians, when they have lived up to the highest ideals of their faith, have defended the weak and vulnerable and worked tirelessly to protect and strengthen vital institutions of civil society, beginning with the family.<br><br>We are Orthodox, Catholic, and Evangelical Christians who have united at this hour to reaffirm fundamental truths about justice and the common good, and to call upon our fellow citizens, believers and non-believers alike, to join us in defending them. These truths are (1) the sanctity of human life, (2) the dignity of marriage as the conjugal union of husband and wife, and (3) the rights of conscience and religious liberty. Inasmuch as these truths are foundational to human dignity and the well-being of society, they are inviolable and non-negotiable. Because they are increasingly under assault from powerful forces in our culture, we are compelled today to speak out forcefully in their defence, and to commit ourselves to honouring them fully no matter what pressures are brought upon us and our institutions to abandon or compromise them. We make this commitment not as partisans of any political group but as followers of Jesus Christ, the crucified and risen Lord, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.<br><br><b>Human Life</b><br><br><i>The lives of the unborn, the disabled, and the elderly are ever more threatened. </i><br><br>While public opinion has moved in a pro-life direction, powerful and determined forces are working to expand abortion, embryo-destructive research, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. Although the protection of the weak and vulnerable is the first obligation of government, the power of government is today often enlisted in the cause of promoting what Pope John Paul II called “the culture of death.” We pledge to work unceasingly for the equal protection of every innocent human being at every stage of development and in every condition. We will refuse to permit ourselves or our institutions to be implicated in the taking of human life and we will support in every possible way those who, in conscience, take the same stand.<br><br><b>Marriage</b><br><br><i>The institution of marriage, already wounded by promiscuity, infidelity and divorce, is at risk of being redefined and thus subverted. </i><br><br>Marriage is the original and most important institution for sustaining the health, education, and welfare of all. Where marriage erodes, social pathologies rise. The impulse to redefine marriage is a symptom, rather than the cause, of the erosion of the marriage culture. It reflects a loss of understanding of the meaning of marriage as embodied in our civil law as well as our religious traditions. Yet it is critical that the impulse be resisted, for yielding to it would mean abandoning the possibility of restoring a sound understanding of marriage and, with it, the hope of rebuilding a healthy marriage culture. It would lock into place the false and destructive belief that marriage is all about romance and other adult satisfactions, and not, in any intrinsic way, about the unique character and value of acts and relationships whose meaning is shaped by their aptness for the generation, promotion and protection of life. Marriage is not a “social construction,” but is rather an objective reality—the covenantal union of husband and wife—that it is the duty of the law to recognise, honour, and protect.<br><br><b>Religious Liberty</b><br><br><i>Freedom of religion and the rights of conscience are gravely jeopardized. </i><br><br>The threat to these fundamental principles of justice is evident in efforts to weaken or eliminate conscience protections for healthcare institutions and professionals, and in anti-discrimination statutes that are used as weapons to force religious institutions, charities, businesses, and service providers either to accept (and even facilitate) activities and relationships they judge to be immoral, or go out of business. Attacks on religious liberty are dire threats not only to individuals, but also to the institutions of civil society including families, charities, and religious communities. The health and well-being of such institutions provide an indispensable buffer against the overweening power of government and is essential to the flourishing of every other institution - including government itself - on which society depends. <br><br><b>Unjust Laws</b><br><br>As Christians, we believe in law and we respect the authority of earthly rulers. We count it as a special privilege to live in a democratic society where the moral claims of the law on us are even stronger in virtue of the rights of all citizens to participate in the political process. Yet even in a democratic regime, laws can be unjust. And from the beginning, our faith has taught that civil disobedience is required in the face of gravely unjust laws or laws that purport to require us to do what is unjust or otherwise immoral. Such laws lack the power to bind in conscience because they can claim no authority beyond that of sheer human will.<br><br><b>Therefore</b>, let it be known that we will not comply with any edict that compels us or the institutions we lead to participate in or facilitate abortions, embryo-destructive research, assisted suicide, euthanasia, or any other act that violates the principle of the profound, inherent and equal dignity of every member of the human family. <br><br><b>Further</b>, let it be known that we will not bend to any rule forcing us to bless immoral sexual partnerships, treat them as marriages or the equivalent, or refrain from proclaiming the truth, as we know it, about morality, marriage, and the family. <br><br><b>Further</b>, let it be known that we will not be intimidated into silence or acquiescence or the violation of our consciences by any power on earth, be it cultural or political, regardless of the consequences to ourselves. We will fully and ungrudgingly render to Caesar what is Caesar’s. But under no circumstances will we render to Caesar what is God’s.”<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Lethal Combination of an Anti-Christian Multiculturalism and Secularization">(February 2010) The Lethal Combination of an Anti-Christian Multiculturalism and Secularization</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2010</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>At the end of January was a conference, organised by Anglican Mainstream, called <i>What can I possibly say?</i> It had both a pastoral and theoretical focus. The pastoral focus was, in part, on helping people with SSA (Same Sex Attraction) “who accept the Bible’s prohibition of homosexual practice and yet are aware of homosexual tendencies or struggle with other sexual and relational issues” (to quote from True Freedom Trust, one of the charities represented).<br><br>Also pastorally there was an aim of helping people understand the dire emotional (as well as physical) consequences of the sexualised culture that is now eroding public life in the West. So one of the many seminars was led by Jenny Taylor, a writer on cultural and mission affairs, whose new book is entitled <i>A Wild Constraint: The case for Chastity.</i> This seminar related particularly to the damage done to women (not least young women) in the current sexual free for all.<br><br>The Christian convictions of the conference were well summed up in the conference brochure with a quote from C.S.Lewis’ <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>. These are imaginative letters written by the Devil to a lesser devil. So in one letter the Devil writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Never forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and normal and satisfying form, we are, in a sense on the Enemy’s [i.e. God’s] ground. I know we have won many a soul through pleasure. All the same, it is [God’s] invention, not ours. He made the pleasures. All our research so far has not enabled us to produce one. All we can do is to encourage the humans to take the pleasures, which our Enemy has produced, at times or in ways or in degrees which He has forbidden. Hence we always try to work away from the natural condition of any pleasure to that in which it is least natural, least redolent of its Maker, and least pleasurable. An ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Another quote came from J.D.Unwin, the social scientist and historian:</p>

<blockquote><div>“In human records there is no instance of a society retaining its energy after a complete new generation has inherited a tradition which does not insist upon prenuptial and postnuptial continence.”</div></blockquote>

<p>But how has the present ethical chaos come about? To open the discussion at a theoretical level on how our culture has silenced the church, I was asked to give a short analysis on ‘<i>the lethal combination of an anti-Christian multiculturalism and secularisation</i>’. What follows was my contribution.<br><br><b>Background</b><br><br>“From the heyday of the “Enlightenment” in the 18th century until about 1960 an over confident rationalism influenced Christian Europe as it modernized itself through science and technology. From the 1960s, however, the Enlightenment beliefs that denied sin and affirmed human perfectibility (through evolution and education) have been in retreat giving rise to a post-modern and increasingly irrational world. It has been well said [see David Wells, <i>Losing Our Virtue</i>] that this has produced a distorting four-fold substitution in our culture.<br><br>First, there is a substitution of values for virtues, where values may be nothing more than personal preferences, while virtues have been seen as normative for all. <br><br>Secondly, there is a substitution of the self for human nature. The self is an identity unique to each individual, defined by choice and often claiming special rights. Human nature, however, has been seen as common to all and, being in the image of God, distinguishable from animals, inviolable, and the ground of all rights - but now no longer. <br><br>Thirdly, there is a substitution of personality for character. Personality is the creation of a post 60s, TV, image dominated and morally vacuous culture. It is a staging of ourselves for public view. Character, on the other hand, is what makes the practice of virtue habitual and even unconscious. <br><br>Fourthly, there is a substitution of shame for guilt. Shame is the embarrassment felt when seen as we are and for which the psychological remedy is shamelessness. Guilt by contrast is, as David Wells calls it, “the siren of our moral nature”. It relates to who we are and what we have done with God’s  moral law.”<br><br>All this has been the background for, in turn, a four-fold denial of reality relating to secularization, multiculturalism, an anti-Christian culture and the lethal combination of those three. Let me explain.<br><br><b>First, the denial of reality and secularisation</b><br><br>August Comte, the father of sociology, saw a progression of three stages in history – from the theological to the metaphysical to the scientific. Accordingly until the 1970s secularization theory held that modernization led to the demise of religion. <br><br>Since the 1970s that is seen as false with the reality being that secularization is retreating world-wide except in Europe and also for a small band of intelligentsia that circles the world and has dominated modern media, education, therapeutic services and central government bureaucracies. So Peter Berger, a well-known former secularization theorist, now produces such books as <i>The Desecularization of the World </i>and (the very latest) <i>Religious America, Secular Europe</i>. The reality is the world is desecularizing - witness the revival of Islam and the so called, but real, ‘conflict of civilizations’. <br><br><b>Secondly, the denial of reality and multi-culturalism</b><br><br>The global intelligentsia seeks to handle the potential for cultural conflict by the privatization of religion and with a proposal for a syncretistic multiculturalism. The reality, however, is that a ‘naked public square’, where beliefs regarding ‘the good life’ are excluded, is impossible. <br><br>Some belief is required for competent administration and just legal arrangements. The creeping totalitarianism of current politics in the UK suggest that this belief is now ‘the good life’ as defined by the new secular religion of multiculturalism, which has its own saints and symbols and is intolerant of a religion like Christianity, which claims some beliefs true while others false, and some behaviours right while others wrong. <br><br>Also it not only prevents Christians publicly identifying sins; it now makes them complicit in them – witness the requirement for Christian registrars to register civil partnerships and the requirement for gay adoption from Christian adoption agencies.<br><br><b>Thirdly, the denial of reality and a progressively anti-Christian culture</b><br><br>Thomas Jefferson, a great liberal and a founder of the USA, once asked:</p>

<blockquote><div>‘Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties were a gift of God?’</div></blockquote>

<p>The reality is that liberal democracies can only flourish when under a Christian canopy. A nation needs the Fatherhood of God to secure the brotherhood of man. Liberal democracy requires a philosophy that sees three things:<i> one</i>, the importance of the state as a God given institution, exercising power but never enforcing beliefs; <i>two</i>, the importance of the individual as made in God’s image, so needing protection, but also fallen, so needing correction; and, <i>three</i>, mediating communities like churches and, vitally, heterosexual married families, which act as essential buffers between the totalitarian instincts of the state and the anarchic instincts of the individual. Christianity provides such a philosophy.<br><br><b>Fourthly, the denial of reality and the lethal combination of an anti-Christian multiculturalism and secularisation</b><br><br>Such a combination is lethal because, <i>one</i>, it fails to realize that because the modern world is desecularizing, social judgments must be made about the various religions in respect of truth, error and morality. But this it prohibits. It is lethal, <i>two</i>, because it fails to realize that marginalizing the Christian faith is destroying the canopy under which democratic liberalism is possible. Such liberalism is not weak but strong and expects open debate and disagreement. As John Locke, the God-father of democratic liberalism, said in 1668:</p>

<blockquote><div>‘I would not have [it] understood as if I meant to condemn all charitable admonitions and affectionate endeavours to reduce men from errors, which are, indeed, the greatest duty of a Christian. Anyone may employ as many exhortations and arguments as he pleases towards the promoting of another man’s salvation. But all force and compulsion are to be forborne.’”</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Lent with C.S.Lewis">(March 2010) Lent with C.S.Lewis</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2010</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Lent</b><br><br>Lent (the forty day period leading up to Good-Friday and Easter) probably evolved from training classes for people being baptized in the early church. At that time baptism often took place at Easter. Prior to baptism, and as preparation, candidates would have been encouraged to fast, pray, give money to those in need, and read the Bible – four activities still associated with Lent. But it was not long before many established Christians in the early church, by way of a “refresher” period, similarly had a period before Easter for fasting, praying, giving and reading the Bible. <br><br>At the start of his own ministry Jesus had a time of preparation in the wilderness; and it lasted forty days. So following his example, this “refresher” period by the time of the famous church Council of Nicea in 325 AD had also become a forty day period. Also, as this period led up to Easter, it was called in the Northern European world, “Lent”, from the Old English “lencten” which is associated with our modern English word “lengthen” and means “spring” – the time when the days “lengthen”.<br><br><b>C.S.Lewis</b><br><br>C.S. Lewis was one of the great defenders of the Christian faith in the 20th century. Having being a brilliant student at University College, Oxford (where Richard Clayton, in whose memory Jesmond Parish Church was founded, had also studied), he then taught English at Magdalen College, Oxford. <br><br>At my senior school my own first form master had recently been Lewis’ pupil at Oxford. Not surprisingly we “entry formers” (as we were then called) were introduced to C.S.Lewis in scripture lessons long before he was a world famous author with books translated into 30 languages and millions of copies sold. However, I have to confess that it was only much later in life that I really came to appreciate the value of C.S.Lewis. So let me now give you some samples of his writing. They are in relation to, <i>one</i>, the past, <i>two</i>, the future and, <i>three</i>, the present. It is no bad thing to think about what Lewis is saying on these subjects at this season of Lent.<br><br><b>The Past</b><br><br>With regard to the past Lewis saw the value of reading <i>books – books from the past. As he had studied the Greek and Roman classics at Oxford as an undergraduate and as his final job was that of Professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Cambridge, you might think “he would say that, wouldn’t he?” The answer is “not necessarily”. Consider his reasoning:</i></p>

<blockquote><div>“We need intimate knowledge of the past. Not that the past has any magic about it. But … we cannot study the future and yet need something to set against the present to remind us that the basic assumptions have been quite different in different periods, and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashion. A man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village. The scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the great cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.”</div></blockquote>

<p>What, then, is the particular problem with <i>new </i>books?</p>

<blockquote><div>“Where they are true they will give us truths which we half knew already. Where they are false they will aggravate the error with which we are already dangerously ill. The only palliative is to keep the clean sea breeze of the centuries blowing through our minds, and this can be done only by reading old books. People were no cleverer then than they are now; they made as many mistakes as we - but not the same mistakes. They will not flatter us in the errors we are committing; and their own errors, being now open and palpable, will not endanger us.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The Future</b><br><br>I have to admit to reading a new book recently. But it was John G.Stackhouse’s <i>Making the Best of it – following Christ in the real world </i>where one chapter contains these reminders of some of Lewis’ teaching. With regard to Heaven and the future Stackhouse pointed out that C.S.Lewis did not accept the (particularly) medieval concept of the Beatific Vision – the endless mystical contemplation of God – as the only goal of human life. Rather he had the following “vision”:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The promises of Scripture may, very roughly, be reduced to five heads. It is promised, firstly, that we shall be with Christ; secondly, that we shall be like him; thirdly, with an enormous wealth of imagery, that we shall have ‘glory’; fourthly, that we shall, in some sense, be fed or feasted or entertained; and, finally, that we shall have some sort of official position in the universe – ruling cities, judging angels, being pillars of God’s temple.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Of course, the full realization of this follows the Second Coming of Christ. But the Second Coming is a doctrine which…</p>

<blockquote><div>“… is deeply uncongenial to the whole evolutionary or developmental character of modern thought. We have been taught to think of the world as something that grows slowly towards perfection, something that ‘progresses’ or ‘evolves’. Christian Apocalyptic offers us no such hope … It foretells a sudden, violent end imposed from without … a curtain rung down on the play.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The Resurrection Body</b><br><br>But there will be continuity as well as discontinuity with life now:</p>

<blockquote><div>“We must, indeed, believe the risen body to be extremely different from the mortal body; but the existence, in that new state, of anything that could in any sense be described as ‘body’ at all, involves some sort of spatial relations and in the long run a whole new universe. That is the picture – not of unmaking but of remaking.”</div></blockquote>

<p>And the hope of heaven should thrill us all:</p>

<blockquote><div>“If we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that Our Lord finds our desires, not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.”</div></blockquote>

<p>But isn’t there a danger in thinking too much of heaven (and hell)? Not really, if we are concerned for other people:</p>

<blockquote><div>“It may be possible for each to think too much of his own potential glory hereafter. It is hardly possible for him to think too often or too deeply about that of his neighbour. The load, or weight, or burden of my neighbour’s glory should be laid daily on my back … It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree, helping each other to one or other of those destinations.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The Present</b><br><br>But we all also need to be concerned for the present. We must not be too caught up in the past or be wholly focusing on our plans and hopes for the future of this world. That is why Lewis makes Screwtape (the Devil and arch-tempter) say to Wormwood (the apprentice devil) in the <i>Screwtape Letters</i>:</p>

<p>“To be sure, the Enemy [<i>God</i>] wants men to think of the Future too – just so much as is necessary for now planning the acts of justice and charity which will probably be their duty tomorrow … He does not want men to give the Future their hearts, to place their treasure in it. We do! His ideal is a man who, having worked all day for the good of posterity (if that is his vocation), washes his mind of the whole subject, commits the issue to Heaven, and returns at once to the patience or gratitude demanded by the moment that is passing over him. But we want a man hag-ridden by the Future – haunted by visions of an imminent heaven or hell upon earth – ready to break the Enemy’s commands in the Present if by so doing we make him think he can attain the one or avert the other – dependent for his faith on the success or failure of schemes whose end he will not live to see. We want a whole race perpetually in pursuit of the rainbow’s end, never honest, not kind, nor happy <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>What was said of Abel in Hebrews 11.4 is surely also true of C.S.Lewis: “by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.”<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Easter and Life After Death">(April 2010) Easter and Life After Death</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2010</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li><li>resurrection</li><li>forgiveness</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Bertrand Russell</b><br><br>Bertrand Russell was an ‘enfant terrible’ of the earlier part of the last century. Before the Second World War he gained some notoriety for his views on sexual behaviour. He was one of the forerunners of the permissive society. “I developed the view,” he tells us, “that complete fidelity was not to be expected in most marriages.” But he not only threw overboard Christian personal and sexual ethics, he also jettisoned Christian beliefs about God and Jesus Christ. His book <i>Why I am not a Christian </i>shows us his position – a position that had no room for the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br><br>For many in the Western world of the twentieth century he symbolised and summed up their own attitudes and ideas. He was able to give expression to these in a way few could imitate. Listen to how he soliloquises on the meaning of life and the universe. It is a brilliant description of despair.</p>

<blockquote><div>“The mental night that has descended upon me is less brief and promises no awakening after sleep. Formerly the cruelty, the meanness, the dusty fretful passion of human life seemed to me a little thing, set, like some resolved discord in music, amid the splendour of the stars and the stately procession of geological ages. What if the universe was to end in universal death; it was none the less unruffled and magnificent. But now all this has shrunk to be no more than my own reflection in the windows of the soul, through which I look out upon the night of nothingness.The revolutions of nebulae, the birth and death of stars, were no more than convenient fictions in the trivial work of linking together my own sensations, and perhaps those of other men not much better than myself. No dungeon was ever constructed so dark and narrow as that in which the shadow physics of our time imprisons us; for every prisoner has believed that outside his walls a free world existed; but now the prison has become the whole universe. There is darkness without and when I die there will be darkness within. There is no splendour, no vastness, anywhere; only triviality for a moment, and then nothing.”</div></blockquote>

<p>I shall never forget one occasion when it seemed right to read that passage in public. I was on a university mission in Oxford when over the radio we heard of the death of Bertrand Russell. After a very long life the old philosopher and anti-nuclear campaigner was no more. It was a sad moment. David MacInnes, [then] from Birmingham was the main missioner on the mission team. So I suggested to him that he should read this passage from Russell’s <i>Autobiography </i>[recently published] during his address that night. The Union Debating chamber was packed. There was an ‘overflow’ meeting to a nearby hall. Hundreds of students were present, and most had by now heard of Russell’s death.<br><br>As the passage was read out there was total silence. Here was a man who had died without God and without hope and who, very publicly, had turned his back on the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The contrast between the glorious hope of Jesus and the Resurrection being preached that night and the total despair of Bertrand Russell could almost be felt.<br><br><b>Hope and forgiveness</b><br><br>Contrast that with the situation of another man. He was from Alaska and in the world’s terms, unlike Russell, insignificant. He had a bad home. The only friendship he ever experienced was from a Christian school teacher. Many years after he left school, the teacher received a letter. The gist of it was this: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Dear Teacher, You may not remember me; but I’ve now got an ugly story. I’m in death row awaiting execution for murder.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The letter went on like this: </p>

<blockquote><div>“I desire to die so that is OK; but one thing bothers me. I’m afraid of what comes after death. I know you believe in God and prayer, and that is why I ask your help now. In other words, I cannot face what lies beyond with guilt on my soul and no hope of forgiveness. If you still believe in God, write and give me the courage to face death.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The teacher then entered into correspondence. She spoke of the death of Christ on the cross and how he had borne the penalty for human sin as she believed. Then she made a positive suggestion. He should take a big sheet of paper and write down all this crimes, fears, sins and hatreds and say, “God, there it all is – all of it. Forgive me Father” and then destroy the paper.<br><br>The result was another letter: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Dear Teacher, I followed your instructions perfectly. I want you to know – because you love me regardless of everything. I stayed on my knees all night praying. I wasn’t conscious of time or anything, only of God’s forgiveness and love pouring over my guilty soul.When the guard came with breakfast I lay on the floor as though dead. The man stared at me, turned white and fear showed in his eyes. ‘You OK?’ he choked out. I nodded and smiled. The guard looked at me again. ‘My God,’ he gasped, ‘there’s light on your face.’ He set the tray down and fled.Through God’s grace I am clean, clean. I could shout it from the house tops … I’m not afraid anymore of death or the hereafter. I am condemned to die in the gas chamber. I am ready to go to meet my God.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Compared with Bertrand Russell here was a man humanly insignificant. But he was a man with a sure and certain hope as he prepared for death. And it was the resurrection of Jesus that gave him assurance of <i>forgiveness </i>as well as hope.<br><br>Jesus implied that the resurrection and forgiveness go together. Before his disciples had much idea about the Resurrection or even of his death, Jesus began to make them think about the question of where he was soon to go. His remarks were enigmatic, but later they were seen to have been providing clues about the <i>meaning </i>as well as the destination of his journey.<br><br>Think back to that occasion when the disciples were in the upper room the evening before the Crucifixion. Jesus had washed their feet – a remarkable sign of humility and service. Judas had gone out into the night. And Jesus then said, “I am going to him who sent me” (John 16.5) and went on to speak about the Holy Spirit. He said that the Holy Spirit would come to them, when he left, and would “convince the world” on issues such as sin righteousness and judgment. But the conviction of the world over “righteousness” would be directly related to where Jesus was going: “the Counsellor will … convince the world … concerning righteousness <i>because I go to the Father</i>, and you will see me no more” (John 16.10). No doubt this was confusing to those disciples as it is today to anyone not familiar with the events that followed. But after the resurrection of Jesus the disciples came to see precisely what it meant.<br><br>Among other things it meant that the resurrection of Jesus from the tomb was God’s “Yes” to his death on the cross. To them it proved that on the cross Christ had borne the world’s sin and guilt – and that included theirs. Christ’s death was not a criminal’s punishment, even though some thought judicial crucifixion could only be that. The Resurrection proved the “rightness” of Christ. So his death had to be something very different. In time it was seen as God’s way of enabling them to be “right” with him and forgiven. Paul summarised that when he said: “Jesus our Lord … was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification (lit. ‘to establish our justification’)” (Rom 4.25). And this is what that man in Alaska believed.<br><br><b>Postscript</b><br><br>Most of the above I previously wrote in <i>Where did Jesus go? – the truth and meaning of the Resurrection </i>(published in 1983). The book was written to answer the question: “But was it all wishful thinking? Did Jesus go anywhere apart from into the ground?” For the (shorter) answer “No! it was not all wishful thinking” go to the JPC website at www.church.org.uk and the <i>Coloured Supplement </i>for April 2007 entitled <i>The Resurrection – Spiritual or Physical? </i><br><br>The key evidence, of course, is in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These are sufficiently different to show they are not just copying each other (their main differences relate to the appearances of Jesus, but this is what you would expect if Jesus <i>did </i>meet different disciples on different occasions). However, they are sufficiently similar in their accounts of the empty tomb. Also when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians 15 on the Resurrection in AD 56, we are told that many of the disciples who had seen Jesus after the Resurrection "are still alive" (1 Corinthians 15:6). It is unthinkable that any eyewitnesses would have allowed a Resurrection tradition to develop so uniformly if it was fiction.</p>

<blockquote><div>“Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (1 Peter 1.3).</div></blockquote>

                <p>THE CHRISITAN INSTITUTE’S<br>ELECTION BRIEFING<br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>and a comment by David Holloway<br><br><br>[<i>Can I commend to you the Election Briefing of the </i>Christian Institute<i>. Having been available on-line at www.christian.org.uk it is now available in printed form. Below is the general “Introduction” to the briefing’s detailed analysis. <br><br>We are living at a critical time both in Western and British history. In the West there is creeping totalitarianism on the part of Governments. In Britain Fundamental liberties are being denied on the one hand, while on the other hand an enforced decadent libertarianism is causing social and moral chaos. It is vital, therefore, at this election time that Christians both pray and then vote appropriately. I personally thank God for the staff of the Institute for the production of this essential resource for the churches at this time together with the provision of candidates’ voting records on Institute’s website. DRJH</i>]<br><br><b>The General Election 6 May 2010. </b><br><br>As Christian citizens, we should think carefully about how we should vote. The Christian Institute as a registered charity does not endorse any political party or candidate in the Election. It cannot tell you who to vote for. That is a matter for you. What it does is provide you with factual information about the policies of the political parties and key background information on legislation and public policy. This is set out in the Christian Institute’s <i>Election Briefing</i>. In addition (also on its website) you can find the voting records of all MPs on a specific range of moral issues. You may wish to use this information to help form an opinion about your MP. There may be other issues that you wish to consider. Since the website’s votes-database only applies to MPs from the Parliament just dissolved, it will not help inform you about the other candidates for your constituency. Neither will it help if your MP is standing down. To help Christians find out the views of the candidates standing in their own constituencies we have provided <i>Questions for Candidates </i>in the centre of the full <i>Election Briefing </i>(available at the above web address). <br><br>Since its inception the Christian Institute has promoted the Christian faith in the public square in six main areas – marriage and the family, medical ethics, education, religious liberty in the UK, matters of public morality, and the constitution. Within these broad areas, this <i>Election Briefing </i>highlights some of the policies of the three main political parties at Westminster – Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. We also include some of the known policies of those parties which have significant representation at national or European level – the SNP, Plaid Cymru, UKIP and the Greens. Many Christians ask us about the policies of the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Christian Party. These have also been included. Space and time constraints have not permitted us to cover other parties fielding candidates at the General Election.<br><br>In a collapsing culture, public policy is increasingly affected by secular values. The main political parties are by no means immune to this. All three main parties have policy positions with which biblical Christians strongly disagree, such as the endorsement of civil partnerships. In casting a vote Christians are not necessarily endorsing every item of policy of the party they vote for. They are exercising judgment which can often boil down to deciding what is the least worst option.<br><br>Certain parties have an overriding central principle. For example, UKIP believes that the UK should leave the European Union and the SNP holds that Scotland should be independent from the rest of the UK. Of course, Christians who agree with the central principle can vote for these parties in good conscience. But when it comes to the BNP the situation could not be more different. It seems to us that the central principles of that party enshrine beliefs which completely contradict the Christian faith. For example, their ‘whites only’ membership policy. What could be more central than that? The membership policy has only been changed following recent court action. The deputy leader of the BNP recently attacked the democratic rights of Christians. Simon Darby said: “Well, there’s an issue here that the church consistently, every time there is an election, interferes in the electoral process. Perhaps if the church took the attitude that they’ve got a problem with falling congregations and the fact that churches are being rapidly turned into mosques all over this<br>country, people would listen to them.” Our <i>Election Briefing </i>does not consider the policies of the BNP.<br><br>This <i>Election Briefing </i>covers many issues where important Christian principles are at stake. There are many other issues about which Christians show a particular concern and where much material is available (like the Developing World); but we know that many are concerned with issues such as those covered by this briefing.<br><br>We have to have laws to restrain evil and policies to commend what is good  <br>(1 Peter 2:13-14), but the Government is not responsible for everything. Indeed if there is to be freedom, it must not be. Many Christians are gravely concerned about legislative proposals which intrude into ordinary family life, evangelism and the running of the local church. As we pointed out in our 2005 Election Briefing, it is important to say that society is more than the state. Society is made up of families and many institutions and organisations between the state and the citizen. Government by itself cannot solve all our problems or even come remotely close.<br><br>The issues we have highlighted are those where we believe the Bible is clear. They tend to be issues where biblical principles, and in particular the Ten Commandments, directly apply. We cannot break God’s law without there being consequences – to a degree in this life, and fully in the life to come. God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows (Galatians 6:7). A nation will never be blessed by breaking God’s laws.<br><br><b>Christian citizenship</b><br><br>The state is a means of God’s ‘common grace’. The Bible is very clear that the governing authorities act on God’s behalf to restrain evil (see Romans 13 and  <br>1 Peter 2). This is for the good of all people in this world – not just Christians. The Christian has dual citizenship: of heaven (Philippians 3:20) and of an earthly nation (usually that in which he was born). The Christian’s duty is to obey the governing authorities, except where they forbid what God requires, or require what God forbids (Acts 5:29). It is the Christian’s heavenly citizenship which commands the ultimate loyalty. As well as duties, being a citizen gives us certain rights. The Apostle Paul was prepared both to use <i>and not to use</i> his rights as a Roman Citizen depending on which option most benefited the gospel cause (Acts 16:37-39; 21:39; 22:25-29; 25:10-12).<br><br>In 21st Century Britain, we live in what is historically a relatively unusual situation – we live in a democracy. Unique responsibilities and privileges flow from living in a democracy. One is that we have the right to vote. Surely Christians should use this privilege. Christians in Britain today live in a collapsing culture in which God’s moral law is openly flouted. Things will not get better unless this is addressed. The only lasting and real solution to the problem of man’s sin is uniquely provided in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Gospel denies that there can ever be political salvation in this life. Nevertheless, we are to pray that our authorities would provide freedom for the Gospel and freedom for Christians to live “peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness” (1 Timothy 2:1-2). We are to pray that the governing authorities will fulfil their God given mandate and govern according to God’s moral law (Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-14). The General Election provides an opportunity for Christians to speak out and play their part.<br><br><b>Biblical priorities</b><br><br>The Bible gives a clear basis for knowing right from wrong. God’s moral law is laid down for everyone – not just for Christians. Jesus criticised the Pharisees and told them “you have neglected the more important matters of the law – justice, mercy and faithfulness” (Matthew 23:23). This included “setting aside the commands of God” by neglecting their parents (when they needed financial support) in order to observe a man-made tradition (Mark 7:9-12). For Jesus, and for us, it is God’s commands which set out what constitutes justice, mercy and faithfulness. Whilst we are obligated to obey God in everything, certain parts of the moral law are absolutely foundational and fundamental. That is why God has been pleased to give us the Ten Commandments. When it comes to votes in Parliament, there are cases where MPs vote for or against what is taught in the Commandments. For example, a vote for abortion is a vote to break the 6th Commandment (Exodus 20:13). Similarly it is a breach of the 7th commandment (Exodus 20:14) to promote homosexuality to young people in schools or to equate homosexual unions with marriage. These are not matters of political opinion, but straightforward issues of right or wrong.<br><br>At this General Election, MPs’ expenses and the economy will both loom large. Biblical principles apply directly to both issues, e.g. honesty, integrity and the proper use of money. The Archbishop of Canterbury has attacked the policy of spending our way out of recession, saying “it seems a little bit like the addict returning to the drug”. When it comes to the economy, Christians can legitimately disagree about the best way to tackle the UK’s deficit. This is because in order to make a judgment many other facts need to be assessed. For example, there can be no doubt that the state has a right to levy taxes (Romans 13:7), but we can never be absolutely certain about what should be the correct level of income tax. There are many economic and moral factors involved and Christians who hold to biblical truth can legitimately disagree on the interpretation of the facts.<br><br><i>The Christian Institute, however, believes that there are three touchstone issues for Christians in 2010: religious liberty, the sanctity of marriage and the sanctity of human life.</i><br><br><b>Religious liberty </b><br><br>Recession is not the only cause of economic hardship for Christians in Britain. Hotel owners, Ben and Sharon Vogelenzang from Liverpool, have seen their business brought to the brink of collapse after false allegations led to their prosecution in court. Even though the judge found they were innocent of wrongdoing in their discussion with a Muslim guest, the NHS hospital which previously provided 80% of their income will no longer give them business. Likewise Lillian Ladele has had to leave her post as a marriage registrar after the courts ruled that she must carry out civil partnerships. Other cases have shown that Christians are increasingly being marginalised in Britain; those working in the public sector come under particular pressure to suppress their beliefs.<br><br>The marginalisation of Christians must be a vital issue for Christians at the General Election; and not only because we should have a special care for Christians who are suffering for their faith (Matthew 25:31-46; Galatians 6:10; Hebrews 13:3). Christ clearly taught that his followers are the salt which preserves society and the light which guides it (Matthew 5:13-16). If the salt remains in the salt cellar and the light is increasingly hidden under a secular bushel, then it will become very much harder for Christians to do those good works which transform society. Suppressing moral values will accelerate the moral decline of our society.<br><br><b>Marriage</b><br><br>Two of the Ten Commandments specifically protect marriage, so it is obviously very important (the fifth, ‘Honour your father and mother’, and the seventh, ‘Do not commit adultery’). Marriage is not an arbitrary construct; it is an ‘honourable estate’ based on the different, complementary natures of men and women – and how they refine, support, encourage, and complete one another. Stable married families are a primary carrier of values. It is in married families that values are most effectively passed down through the generations. In the family children learn right from wrong, learn to get along with others and learn to control their own selfish impulses. Marriage creates new relationships uniting the families of husband and wife. A nation is made up of families and individuals; the wider family networks created by marriage form the basis of civil society. Marriage has always had a privileged position in law precisely because it is the cornerstone of society. All around the world, across all religions and cultures, the successful societies have been those based upon marriage.<br><br>Our leaders must therefore commend marriage, as it is right and for the good of everyone, and all attempts to relativise or sideline marriage should be strongly resisted. Introducing ‘gay marriage’ would destroy the uniqueness of true marriage in law and downgrade its status in society. Cohabitation is a transient state and should not be treated as equivalent to marriage. Easy divorce laws have led to a lax attitude to marriage and a society in which many children grow up without their father. Such sad circumstances negatively affect those who will be the adults of future generations. The downgrading of marriage is not just one issue among many, but foundational to our country’s deepest social problems. <br><br><b>The sanctity of life</b><br><br>The sixth commandment simply says, “You shall not murder”. A vote for abortion or euthanasia is contrary to this commandment. The Christian Church has always protested against abortion. Something is clearly very wrong with our society when babies are being aborted up to birth because they are disabled (the disability has been as minor as a cleft palate). The Bible commands us to speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves (Proverbs 31:8). The unborn are the most vulnerable members of society. With one in five pregnancies ending in abortion, the womb is the most dangerous place to be. Overall in 2008 in England and Wales, 99% of the 202,158 legal abortions were carried out for social reasons.<br><br>We must also continue to oppose vigorously all attempts to legalise euthanasia. People who contemplate ending their own lives and ask others for assistance are at their most vulnerable and emotional. They need a clear, firm law to protect them in their darkest moments. The law should not affirm the belief that some lives are not worth living. Just like the unborn, the old and frail, the disabled and those diagnosed with a degenerative illness are made in God’s image and worthy of dignity and respect. If we are really concerned about their suffering we should support the development of palliative care services. Experts say that almost no patient is beyond the help of pain relieving medicine, yet allowing any form of assisted suicide would undermine the motivation to invest in such services. Some will argue: “Why bother with years of expensive care when you can just end a person’s life? It’s much cheaper.” Christians need to take courage and speak out on the three touchstone issues of religious liberty, the sanctity of marriage and the sanctity of human life: not just on issues which are unlikely to attract opposition.<br><br><b>Candidates and parties</b><br><br>There are perhaps two factors which we all must consider when deciding who to vote for. We must consider <i>the candidates</i> and we must consider the parties they represent. You may feel it is better to vote for an exceptional candidate who shares your Christian views across a range of moral issues, even if they are standing for a party which you would not naturally support. You may feel that the most important consideration is to vote for the candidate who is standing for a party which in your view represents the least worst option. You may feel that it is better to vote for one of the Christian political parties which may happen to stand in your area. These are decisions which ultimately only you can decide. In some constituencies Christian believers may be in an impossible position. Christians should exercise their Christian conscience in these matters. Just because your parents or your work colleagues vote in a certain way does not mean that you need to do the same. It is your choice.<br><br>However, you can’t make an informed decision without knowing what the parties and the candidates stand for. Christians should make it their business to find out the policies of each candidate and party. They should seek to find out their positions on key moral issues. <i>The key to finding your candidates is to be sure what parliamentary area (constituency) you live in. Some constituency boundaries have changed for the 2010 General Election. Type in your postcode </i>at <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/default.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/default.stm</a> <i>to find out.</i><br><br><b>Speaking to candidates</b><br><br>Candidates or their representatives may come to your door or call by telephone or stop you in the street to ask how you intend to vote. This presents an ideal opportunity to raise Christian concerns and to find out where the candidates stand on key issues. A candidate’s opinions on certain moral issues can be quite different from the position of their party. More than at any other time the candidates will be open to listen to your views. Should they be elected they will be representing you in Parliament. Think through two or three issues and have questions ready in case canvassers call or stop you whilst out in the street. Limit yourself to two or three issues with which you are most concerned. Be prepared to give a reason for your view. The full <i>Election Briefing </i>will help you get to grips with the issues you are interested in. If you speak to the candidate himself, ask if he is willing to raise your concerns in Parliament if elected. If he says that he will, you can hold him to this promise should he be elected. If you speak to a representative canvassing on behalf of the candidate, ask for your concerns to be forwarded. The very act of asking questions is a Christian witness.<br><br><b>Writing to your candidates </b><br><br>If you don’t want to wait for candidates to knock at your door, then you could write to them either by letter or by email in order to raise your concerns. This way you can be sure that all the candidates are aware of your concerns. Election literature which is put through your letterbox will give the local addresses for your candidates. If your MP is standing again you may want to see how he or she has voted in the past since this is a matter of public record (see the Christian Institute’s website – www.christian.org.uk/election). If you write to a candidate, keep your letter short but do raise specific points. Make sure you tell them that you are a constituent. You could swap notes with other Christian friends who have had contact with a candidate. It is highly unlikely that you will find a party or a candidate you feel has all the right views. In some constituencies there will be the option to vote for a candidate who takes a firm stand on moral issues. This is unlikely to be the norm. Instead it is likely to be a decision about what is the least worst option amongst the political parties and candidates. For many Christians there is a genuine dilemma over choosing a party or a particular candidate. Whatever your decision it is relevant to consider how the parties fared in the last election in your constituency. There are many ways of being a Christian citizen, but a General Election provides a good opportunity for Christians to be salt and light in our society. We must pray for wisdom and speak out for the truth.<br><br><b>Party policies</b><br><br>The parties set out their policies in their manifestos, official policy documents, or resolutions determined by their party conference. The Christian Institute’s website links to the 2010 General Election manifestos covered in this <i>Election Briefing</i>. Obviously the Government’s actions are there for all to see. Since the opposition parties are not in a position to implement their ideas, we can only note what they have said about the Government’s legislation and the way they have voted. Christians must then weigh the evidence and exercise their Christian conscience.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Thoughts on a New Government">(June 2010) Thoughts on a New Government</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2010</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The coalition</b><br><br>What can we expect from the new Lib-Con Coalition that has just been constructed following the General Election of May 2010? These are early days. But no sooner had the Queen’s Speech mapped out the concerns of the new Government than we heard about the Chief Secretary to the Treasury “claiming tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money to rent rooms from his male lover.” One journalist wrote of the new government that “this emerging star of the coalition [<i>had</i>] succeeded in tipping it back into the mire of the late lamented ‘manure’ parliament. The stink won’t go away in a hurry.” From a common sense reading of the rules on Parliamentary expenses almost all were agreed that the problem was not the man’s homosexual relationship. It was his greed or cheating. However, the personal life question will not go away. Nor will it go away so long as Parliamentarians and journalists remain in a state of denial about the significance of sexual behaviour. That is for two reasons. <br><br>First, it is because, according to the latest edition of <i>British Social Attitudes</i>, one in three people (36%) still think homosexual acts are “always” or “mostly” wrong. This figure over recent years has gone from two thirds to one third thinking it wrong. But there has been no serious moral or scientific reasoning for this change of view. Yet this one third who think it wrong are now being denied jobs, being harassed at work for their views, not being allowed to adopt children, being struck off medical adoption and fostering panels because they <i>are</i> wanting to be moral and scientific, and, most serious of all in an allegedly liberal democratic society, they are being prevented even from <i>saying </i>such activity is wrong both for religious and social reasons. <br><br>As they perceive it, this change of heart by one third of the population is precisely that – a change of “heart” in a post-modern world that is devaluing the mind and reasonable argument. It is due, they say, mainly to a brilliantly conceived and concerted campaign using the media, education, the law, and importantly a small but very vocal minority in the church. The result has been, they claim, an imposing of views and values by false statistics and incorrect assumptions. In a post-modern society, where there is no absolute right or wrong and so a lack of sufficient certainties, particularly among the young the ensuing moral vacuum has been easily filled by a well spun and iconoclastic political cause.<br><br>But secondly, the personal life question will not go away because it is not simply a homosexual issue. It relates to both hetero- and homo- sexual relationships. The very first Chairmen of the Committee on Standards in Public Life was Lord Nolan. He was appointed by John Major in 1994 following a “cash-for-questions-scandal”. Sadly, this committee has had to be active since - such has been the moral state of some in Parliament. But Lord Nolan, when interviewed on personal life questions, said this: “Of all the behaviour which in my personal experience has caused the greatest misery to other human beings, I would put adultery pretty high on the list. I don’t actually think you can expect a man with the strains of public life to perform adequately unless he has got a good home life to go back to: someone he loves and a family he loves and some comfort that comes to him. And if you lose sight of the need for loyalty in personal relationships, if you decide that there is no need to stick to monogamy, I believe we shall be in danger of losing the cohesion that holds civilization together.”<br><br>At this time Clause 28 of Margaret Thatcher’s Local Government Act of 1988 still outlawed a local authority “promoting homosexuality”. It was, therefore, still then the case that the majority of the minority of people with exclusive and compulsive same sex attractions either sought help or wanted to keep matters private. The vocal tiny minority had still to re-group after 1988. The public issues at this time were over heterosexual cohabitation, divorce, the family and marriage. On this social science was clear. 50% of cohabiting couples are more likely to have divorced after five years of marriage, and 60% more likely after eight years of marriage than those who have not cohabited. And on average children of divorce are, sadly, significantly disadvantaged. It was becoming obvious that the only sane thing for a society is to privilege heterosexual monogamous life-long marriage.<br><br><b>Universal sexual ethics</b><br><br>Nor was there anything new about this. Marriage and premarriage patterns have always had huge significance, according to the anthropologist J.D.Unwin in his monumental work <i>Sex and Culture</i>. He there tells us that his researches led to two general conclusions. This first is that “the cultural condition of any society in any geographical environment is conditioned by its past and present methods of regulating the relations between the sexes.” The second is that “no society can display productive social energy unless a new generation inherits a social system under which sexual opportunity is reduced to a minimum.”<br><br>The tradition of the Western Christian sexual ethic and family pattern - namely of one man and one woman committed together for life for the sake of society, the children and each other - received remarkable support from this research. “The greatest energy,” said Unwin, “has been displayed only by those societies which have reduced their sexual opportunity to a minimum by the adoption of absolute monogamy”. As Professor V.A.Demant of Oxford once put it: “Part of the mastery over nature in man’s own life has been a mastery over the sexual impulse, to a degree in European Christendom not known elsewhere. But it has been known or practised to some degree throughout mankind’s civilized history. All cultural development has meant the limitation of sexual drives.”<br><br>So personal life issues never have been limited to homosexual activity, Nor should they be. It is simply that the motor for the sexual revolution that has been taking place in the West since the 1960s has been the so called movement for “Gay Liberation”. But, of course, the main issue all along has been the privileging of hetero-sexual monogamous life-long marriage. Necessarily that means the de-privileging of all other relationships. With whatever world-view or philosophy you hold, that will mean sooner or later that sexual behaviours relating to the privileging of marriage will be classed as right or moral, while other sexual behaviours will be classed as wrong or immoral. That is to be expected. A legitimate debate, of course, then can be held over whether such other non-marriage sexual intercourse should not only be classed by the majority as wrong and immoral but also positively proscribed, even minimally, by law. Currently the West has decided that only paedophile relations and rape should be so outlawed. <br><br>But the issue facing the people of Britain and the new coalition is no longer that debate. We have not just overturned Clause 28 and said that immoral behaviour should not be equated with criminal behaviour. We are now being asked to promote the immoral. We are being asked to teach in our schools precisely what Clause 28 forbad. For Clause 28 prevented a local authority “promoting the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.” There is no way these personal life issues will go away in these circumstances. And if Nolan and Unwin are correct they have huge social implications.<br><br><b>Liberal Government</b><br><br>Political life in Western-democracy has evolved over the centuries a true liberalism (as distinct from a growing libertinism posing as liberalism). Such liberal democracy has come from the best of the ancient Greek and Roman traditions married, since Christ, to the Christian tradition. It has evolved from Greek rationality, Roman law and Biblical religion. There have been a number of key components, three of which are most important. <br><br><i>First</i>, there is the use of “reason” in political argument and that means tolerance does not sublimate or ignore differences of view but argues over them reasonably without violence. This produces “civil” society. <i>Secondly</i>, there is the notion of transcendental authority. This comes from a theistic world view or a strong doctrine of natural law, such as the Roman Cicero’s “one eternal and unchangeable law … valid for all nations and all times." This is a basic moral law that Christians claim can be found in the second table of the Ten Commandments and which Paul endorses in Romans 1. This means that Governments are not self-authenticating but subject to a higher law. This is a fundamental check on totalitarianism. <br><br>The <i>third </i>component is government needing the consent of the governed with all deserving respect as created equal, being made in God’s image. This is a distinctly Biblical view. Allied to this are essential human rights. But these are <i>human </i>rights. As Martin Luther King saw, they entitled Blacks to join the normal human family and its normal life. But they are not rights for groups to diverge from the normal human family and normal human morality. To demand a right to sleep with whoever you like or “promote homosexuality” is a clever intellectual sleight of hand that subtly uses “rights talk” to enjoy its moral cash value. Yes, Casanovas can claim the human right to safety and physical protection in a civil society, but not a lover’s right to deflower as many virgins as he wants. Article 1 of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights says: “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity”. That covers everyone. But Article 29 says quite clearly: “In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject … to … <i>the just requirements of morality</i>, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society”.<br><br>These are a few post-election thoughts. How we need to pray for David Cameron and the government that “we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Saviour, who wants all men to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth” (1 Timothy 2.2-4).<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Few Thoughts on Women Bishops">(August 2010) A Few Thoughts on Women Bishops</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2010</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>The modern movement for Women’s Liberation followed the French Revolution with its call for “liberty, equality and fraternity”. Mary Wollstonecraft wrote in 1792 the <i>Vindication of the Rights of Women</i>. Her biographer summed up her views as follows: “Women are human beings before they are sexual beings; mind has no sex; society is wasting its assets if it retains women in the role of convenient domestic slaves and ‘alluring mistresses’, denies them economic independence, and encourages them to be attentive to their looks to the exclusion of all else.” Much has been written since. Following the resulting cultural shift, in 2010 the Church of England wants to make women bishops. Why is there a problem? <br><br><b>History</b><br><br>In the early church women had high status. Because of the exposure of unwanted female infants, it seems that in the contemporary Roman world there were 140 males to 100 females. Not unsurprisingly in the church with its opposition to infanticide (and abortion) women soon outnumbered men. The Christian church with its stricter morals was particularly attractive to women. But the high status of women goes back to Jesus who undermined any prejudice against women. He treated women in a natural and unselfconscious way as real persons. He was concerned to teach the open hearted Mary of Bethany and he revealed the true nature of worship to, of all people, a Samaritan woman. Paul then followed Jesus’ example. He had no distinction of status with regard to his fellow workers whether male or female. These included Phoebe, a deacon, at Cenchreae (Rom 16.1) and at Phillippi there were Euodia and Syntyche, “women who had contended at my side” (Phil 4.3), and Lydia, a great business woman (Acts 16.14). At this time in the Jewish morning prayer a pious Jew could thank God that he was made “a Jew and not a Gentile, a free man and not a slave, <i>a man and not a woman</i>”. It was quite seismic, therefore, when Paul wrote to the Galatians when tempted back to Jewish ways, “there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, <i>male nor female </i>… in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3.28).<br><br>However, while there was this recognition of female equality, at the same time all the apostles Jesus commissioned were men and all the presbyters/priests (literally “elders”) or bishops (literally “overseers”) appointed by the apostles were male. And Paul is clearly against authoritative teaching by women: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man” (1 Tim 2.12). It is true that early on there was some resistance to an exclusive male presbyterate by the heretical Gnostics. But such attempts to ordain women failed in the mainstream of the churches. Epiphanius in the 4th century says that the Gnostics justified this on the basis of Gal 3.28 (above). But he countered by quoting 1 Cor 14.34 and 1 Tim 2.12 (above) and drawing attention to the fact that Paul referred to the order of creation in 1 Cor 11.8. Only in the modern age has the ordaining of women become a live issue, with some of the free churches leading the way. Some more established churches then followed. It is now reported that in the Church of England half those in training to become clergy will be women. But why is there still opposition?<br><br><b>Theological problems</b><br><br>At the heart of the issue are two fundamental questions: “what is the nature of men and women?” and “how do we decide the answer?” Should we take our cue from Mary Wollstonecraft and her assertion that “women are human beings before they are sexual beings” or the Bible? <br><br>Jesus, in his ethical reasoning and especially with regard to sexual matters, insisted on going back to God’s creation intention in Genesis. Genesis teaches that the only difference in human kind before the Fall is that between male and female. Therefore, as has been well said, “to be human is to share humanity with the opposite sex.” We were, and are, created human males or human females, not just humans. Sexuality is not subsequent to creation. Some Greeks tried to say that sex was not part of the created order but subsequent to it. There was a myth of a sexless hominid who was first created and then subsequently split in two. Jumping the centuries, Marx and Engels also argued that sexual difference, apart from minor biological plumbing differences, was due to historical evolution and not essential. But Genesis is clear. Fundamental sexual difference is a matter of creation, not history.<br><br>Genesis also teaches male and female <i>equality </i>in the created order. Genesis 1 verse 27 says: “God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” They then were equally given the mandate to be “fruitful and increase” and “rule over” the created order (v. 28). But in Genesis 2 there is a <i>difference </i>between male and female, with the man being the first to hear God’s command (vv 16-17) and then being required, presumably, to pass it on to his wife. But this priority does not mean any superiority. This was only a problem <i>after </i>the Fall in chapter 3. Then the woman is told: “your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you” (v 16). The man, it is being predicted, will take advantage of the woman’s sexual drives and will exploit, dominate and subjugate her. <br><br>So sexual chaos and male domination is part of this world as sinful. That is why the feminist reaction is understandable and much is reasonable in the face of wrong prejudice. Such prejudice you find in Plato (the Greek philosopher): “a bad man's fate was to be reincarnated as a woman;” and another Greek philosopher, Aristotle said: “females are imperfect males accidentally produced by their fathers’ inadequacy.” Among the religious it was not only Jews that had negative views of women. The Hindu Ghandi once wrote: “a Hindu regards himself as Lord and master of his wife, who must ever dance attendance on him,” while in Islam it was said that Allah made men superior to women. Feminism, however, over-reacts and wants too little, not too much. Common sense says that we need to get back to God’s intention from the fallenness and male domination of Genesis 3 and so not only back to Genesis 1 but to Genesis 1 <i>and </i>2 – to equality <i>and</i> difference, to men and women being “equal but different”. <br><br><b>Culture</b><br><br>But do we not have to adapt to a changing culture? After all, in the Bible we see the nomadic Israelites adapting to the settled agricultural life of Canaan; then to an urbanized mercantile economy under the monarchy; and, in the post-exilic period, to being a small part of a great empire, first Persian, then Hellenic and then Roman. In New Testament times we also see the gospel transplanted from a Jewish and Palestinian environment to a Gentile environment around the Roman world. So do we not now have to adapt to a 21st century culture with its full equality but little difference between men and women, and so make women bishops?<br><br>The problem is twofold. First, neither in Old or New Testament times were some fundamental insights ever traded away. Women were never “institutionalized” in the leadership. Charismatic figures like the judge, Deborah, and prophetesses like Huldah and Philip’s four daughters were ministering and respected and honoured for what the Holy Spirit did through them. But they were not institutional figures. In Old Testament times Israel could have followed the contemporary Ancient Near Eastern culture which in Canaanite religion had institutional priestesses. But it did not. In New Testament times there was every inducement for women to have been institutionalised by ordination into leadership. But the presbyterate was still male. The poet Juvenal in his <i>Sixth Satire </i>tells of a virtual “women’s liberation movement” among Roman women. And when writing to Colossians in a feminized region dominated by native earth mother goddess religions and priestesses, like those of Artemis (at Ephesus) and Cybele (probably at Colosse), Paul omits the reference to “male and female” in Col 3.11.<br><br>Secondly, and perhaps most significant of all, behind a consciousness of differences between men and women is the belief that in some way the relationship between the man and the woman mirrors the relationship within the divine Trinity. 1 Cor 11.3 says: “the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God”; and 1 Cor 15.28 speaks of the Son being “subject” to the Father. I know of the attempts to make these and other similar texts say something other than they seem to be saying. But surely 1 Cor 11 is saying that this hierarchy of relationships is based on the inner life of the divine Trinity. It has nothing to do with culture. Our triune God is the creator of, not the product of, human culture. And note: while there is “subordination” here, there is no subjugation or domination. The Father does not “dominate” the Son. And, of course, the Son is equal to the Father. It was on this that the early Church was adamant in the Arian controversy. So any priority in male leadership has to be one of care and support. Indeed, Jesus said his disciples were <i>not </i>to “exercise authority” like the “kings of the gentiles” but “the one who rules [<i>is to be</i>] like the one who serves” (Lk 22.26) as Jesus was.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The issues are complicated and much more needs to be written about the social consequences of ignoring sexual difference and about how our own culture is regressing from an extreme feminist position. Not all is clear. But it has been said that “no cause is truly lost until it has been adopted by the Church of England.” May this not be true in the case of women bishops.<br><br>[<i>NB: some may like to see www.church.org.uk and my sermons on 23 June 2002 for exegesis on 1 Corinthians 11 and on 21 July 2002 for 1 Timothy 2</i>] <br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Bishop Patrick of Ireland's Confession">(September 2010) Bishop Patrick of Ireland's Confession</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2010</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Next year sees the 150th anniversary of the founding of Jesmond Parish Church. 2011 is also the 1600th anniversary of the death of Patrick, the <i>“Apostle of the Irish”</i> and whose work led to the conversion, through his successors, of the Scots and to the planting of churches in the North of England and on Tyneside. The West window of JPC reminds us not only of the great Christian Reformers of the English Reformation but also of some of the early Celtic Christian leaders. So as we celebrate our Founders, we should not forget the Reformers and these earlier Christians. All have much to teach us from their faith in Jesus Christ. Below are excerpts from the Confessions of Patrick, the founder of <i>“Celtic Christianity”</i>. They were sent to me from a Canadian church and are from an old translation. But they are still an encouragement for today. Patrick faced far greater hostility than we face as we seek to witness to Christ in 21st century Britain. God, however, honoured his obedience and faithfulness. Of course, he and the Celtic Christians (and the Reformers and our Founders) did not get everything right (nor will we). But as US evangelist D.L.Moody once said:</p>

<blockquote><div> “I like my way of doing things than your way of not doing them”.</div></blockquote>

<p>Patrick’s dates are estimated to be c.389-461 AD. His father was a local decurio (a member of a town council) called Calpornius, who was also a deacon in the local church in a village called Bannavem Taburniae. Where that was we do not know, except that it was somewhere in (mainland) Britain. When, however, Patrick was sixteen, pirates invaded and captured thousands (according to Patrick) including himself to work as slaves in Ireland. Patrick then spent the next six year in the wilds of ancient Ireland as a shepherd among pagan and barbaric people. While there, however, he had a conversion experience when, as he says, </p>

<blockquote><div>“the Lord opened to me the sense of my unbelief that I might remember my sins and that I might return with my whole heart to the Lord my God.”</div></blockquote>

<p>At the end of this period he escaped and made his way to a port 200 miles away, no doubt on the SE coast of Ireland. He there persuaded some sailors to take him on board their boat. So given a passage, he landed somewhere on the coast of Britain. After adventures when he felt sustained and protected by God, he left the sailors and returned to his home and family. The next we know is about his training for the ministry. A night vision then called him back to Ireland, probably in 432, where he continued to work until his death (c.461). At some point he was made a bishop, but it is not known exactly when or where or by whom he was consecrated.  <br><br>Stephen Neil in his History of Christian Missions says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Ireland at that time was almost wholly, if not entirely, a heathen country; Patrick writes of his journeys to regions ‘where never any one had come to baptize, or to ordain clergy, or to confirm people’. He encountered much opposition – from the representatives of the old religion, from the kings whom he tried to convert, from British raiders who disrupted his work and massacred his converts. But he outlived his enemies and wore down the opposition; at the time of his death Ireland was largely a Christian country. In his writings Patrick gives the impression of being a man wholly possessed by the love of Christ; simple and not highly educated – he seems to have been painfully conscious of his lack of theological competence and fitness for the office of a bishop. Dreams played a large part in his experience, and he lived at all times conscious of a supernatural world both of good and evil.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Why the precise details of Patrick’s life are difficult to piece together is because the only available primary sources of information are his own short writings, Confessions of St Patrick and The Letter to Coroticus. These documents have been supplemented and probably embellished by later mediaeval traditions. But as another commentator puts it, in spite of legendary material it is fair to say that over the thirty year period of his ministry he </p>

<blockquote><div>“travelled throughout Ireland and that he had a considerable influence on the Irish chieftains of his day. He had special links with Tara, Croagh Patrick and Armagh (it is possible he went to Armagh in 442 and made it the centre of his work). There is no doubt that he broke the power of heathenism in Ireland and that his teaching was scriptural and evangelical.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Patrick’s ministry had results later in mainland Britain with his form of <i>“Celtic Christianity”</i>. This was distinguished from the Roman form of Christian organization by having as the centre of church life not the diocese with its bishop but the monastery with its abbot; and from these monasteries, like a big parish church or cathedral with many staff, clergy and others went out evangelising the surrounding region and planting new churches. <br><br>The breakthrough for Britain came a hundred years after the death of Patrick. That was when in 563 a mission went from Ireland to Scotland and a Christian centre was established with a new monastery on the island of Iona. The leader there was Columba. This subsequently proved strategic for the conversion of the Scots, people in the North of England and parts of continental Europe. The North of England was evangelised by a mission under Aidan. He established a work in the North East in 635 and a monastery in Lindisfarne (Holy Island), the remains of which can, of course, be seen today. With the support of King Oswald (based at nearby Bamburgh) the team at Lindisfarne worked as missionaries among the pagan English of Northumbria. Also a school was set up in the monastery where boys learnt to read and write - reading the Bible and other Christian literature. The boys were also trained in mission work and girls, too, were encouraged to be educated. The community’s artistic skills were quite remarkable. The Lindisfarne Gospels are still world famous.<br><br>So as we begin to plan for 2011 on Tyneside, remembering 150 years ago, may we also remember Patrick and his evangelism in Ireland 1600 years ago.<br><br><br><b>BISHOP PATRICK’S CONFESSION</b><br><br>1) I am Patrick, a sinner, most unlearned, the least of all the faithful, and utterly despised by many. My father was Calpornius, a deacon, son of Potitus, a priest, of the village Bannavem Taburniae; he had a country seat nearby, and there I was taken captive.<br><br>I was about sixteen years of age. I did not know the true God. I was taken into captivity to Ireland with many thousands of people – and deservedly so, because we turned away from God, and did not keep His commandments, and did not obey our priests, who used to remind us of our salvation. And the Lord brought over us the wrath of his anger and scattered us among many nations, even unto the utmost part of the earth, where now my littleness is placed among strangers.<br><br>2) And there the Lord opened the sense of my unbelief that I might at last remember my sins and be converted with all my heart to the Lord my God, who had regard for my abjection, and mercy on my youth and ignorance, and watched over me before I knew Him, and before I was able to distinguish between good and evil, and guarded me, and comforted me as would a father his son.<br><br>3) Hence I cannot be silent – nor, indeed, is it expedient – about the great benefits and the great grace which the Lord has deigned to bestow upon me in the land of my captivity; for this we can give to God in return after having been chastened by Him, to exalt and praise his wonders before every nation that is anywhere under heaven.<br><br>4) Because there is no other God, nor ever was, nor will be, than God the Father unbegotten, without beginning, from whom is all beginning, the Lord of the universe, as we have been taught; and His son Jesus Christ, whom we declare to have always been with the Father, spiritually and ineffably begotten by the Father before the beginning of the world, before all beginning; and by Him are made all things visible and invisible. He was made man, and having defeated death, was received into heaven by the Father; and He hath given Him all power over all names in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue shall confess to Him that Jesus Christ is Lord and God, in whom we believe, and whose advent we expect soon to be, judge of the living and the dead, who will render to every man according to his deeds; and He has poured forth upon us abundantly the Holy Spirit, the gift and pledge of immortality, who makes those who believe and obey sons of God and joint heirs with Christ; and Him we do confesss and adore, one God in the Trinity of the Holy Name.<br><br>14) In the light, therefore, of our faith in the Trinity I must make this choice, regardless of the danger I must make known the gift of God and everlasting consolation, without fear and frankly I must spread everywhere the name of God so that after my decease I may leave a bequest to my brethren and sons whom I have baptised in the Lord – so many thousands of people.<br><br>16) But after I came to Ireland – every day I had to tend sheep, and many times a day I prayed – the love of God and His fear came to me more and more, and my faith was strengthened. And my spirit was moved so that in a single day I would say as many as a hundred prayers, and almost as many in the night, and this even when I was staying in the woods and on the mountain; and I used to get up for prayer before daylight, through snow, through frost, through rain, and I felt no harm, and there was no sloth in me – as I now see, because the spirit within me was then fervent. <br><br>20) That same night, when I was asleep, Satan assailed me violently, a thing I shall remember as long as I shall be in this body. And he fell upon me like a huge rock, and I could not stir a limb. But whence came it into my mind, ignorant as I am, to call upon Helias [the Sun]? And meanwhile I saw the sun rising in the sky, and while I was shouting <i>“Helias! Helias!”</i> with all my might, suddenly the splendour of that sun fell on me and immediately freed me of all misery. And I believe that I was sustained by Christ my Lord, and that His Spirit was even then crying out in my behalf, and I hope it will be so on the day of my tribulation, as it is written in the Gospel: on that day, the Lord declares, it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father than speaketh in you.<br><br>23) Again after a few years I was in Britain with my people, who received me as their son, and sincerely besought me that now at last, having suffered so many hardships, I should not leave them and go elsewhere.<br><br>And there I saw in the night the vision of a man, whose name was Victorinus, coming as it were from Ireland, with countless letters. And he gave me one of them, and I read the opening words of the letter, which were, <i>“The voice of the Irish;”</i> and as I read the beginning of the letter I thought that at the same moment I heard their voice – they were those beside the Wood of Voclut, which is near the Western Sea – and thus did they cry out as with one mouth: <i>“We ask thee, boy, come and walk among us once more.”</i><br><br>And I was quite broken in heart, and could read no further, and so I woke up. Thanks be to God, after many years the Lord gave to them according to their cry.<br><br>24) And another night – whether within me, or beside me, I know not, God knoweth – they called me most unmistakenly with words which I heard but could not understand, except that at the end of the prayer He spoke thus: <i>“He that has laid down his life for thee, it is He that speaketh in thee;”</i> and so I awoke full of joy.<br><br>25) And again I saw Him praying in me, and I was as it were within my body, and I heard Him above me, that is over the inward man, and there He prayed mightily with groanings. And all the time I was astonished, and wondered, and thought with myself who it could be that prayed in me. But at the end of the prayer He spoke, saying that He was the Spirit; and so I woke up, and remembered the Apostle saying: The Spirit helpeth the infirmities of our prayer. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings, which connot be expressed in words; and again: The Lord our advocate asketh for us.<br><br>33) Enough of this. I must not, however, hide God’s gift which He bestowed upon me in the land of my captivity; because then I earnestly sought Him, and there I fournd him, and He saved me from all evil because – so I believe – of His Spirit that dwelleth in me. Again, boldly said. But God knows it, had this been said to me by a man, I had perhaps remained silent for the love of Christ.<br><br>34) Hence, then, I give unwearied thanks to God, who kept me faithful in the day of my temptation, so that today I can confidently offer Him my soul as a living sacrifice – to Christ my Lord, who saved me out of all my troubles. Thus I can say: <i>“Who am I, O Lord, and to what hast thou called me, Thou who didst assist me with such divine power that today I constantly exalt and magnify Thy name among the heathens wherever I may be, and not only in good days but also in tribulations?”</i> So indeed I must accept with equanimity whatever befalls me, be it good or evil, and always give thanks to God, who taught me to trust in Him always without hesitation, and who must have heard my prayer so that I, however ignorant I was, in the last days dared to undertake such a holy and wonderful work – thus imitating somehow those who as the Lord once foretold, would preach His Gospel for a testimony to all nations before the end of the world. So we have seen it, and so it has been fulfilled: indeed, we are witnesses that the Gospel has been preached unto those parts beyond which there lives nobody.<br><br>38) For I am very much God’s debtor, who gave me such great grace that many people were reborn in God through me and afterwards confirmed, and that clerics were ordained for them everywhere, for a people just coming to the faith, whom the Lord took from the utmost parts of the earth, as He once had promised through his prophets: To Thee the gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth and shall say: <i>“How false are the idols that our fathers got for themselves, and there is no profit in them”</i>; and again: I have set Thee as a light among the gentiles, that Thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost ends of the earth.<br><br>40) For that reason, therefore, we ought to fish well and diligently, as the Lord exhorts in advance and teaches, saying: Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And again He says through the prophets: Behold, I send many fishers and hunters, saith God, and so on. Hence it was most necessary to spread our nets so that a great multitude and throng might be caught for God, and that there be clerics everywhere to baptise and exhort a people in need and want, as the Lord in the Gospel states, exhorts, and teaches, saying: Going therefore now, teach ye all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world. And again He says: Go ye therefore into the whole world for a testimony to all nations, and then shall the end come. And so too the Lord announces through the prophet, and says: And it shall come to pass, in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And in Hosea He saith: <i>“I will call that which was not my people, my people … and her that had not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy. And it shall be in the place where it was said: ‘You are not my people,’ there they shall be called the sons of the living God.”</i><br><br>41) Hence, how did it come to pass in Ireland that those who had a knowledge of God, but until now always worshipped idols and things impure, have now been made a people of the Lord, and are called sons of God, that the sons and daughters of the kings of the Irish are seen to be monks and virgins for Christ?<br><br>42) Among others, a blessed Irishwoman of noble birth, beautiful, full-grown, whom I had baptised, came to us after some days for a particular reason: she told us that she received a message from a messenger of God, and he admonished her to be a virgin of Christ and draw near to God. Thanks be to God, on the sixth day after this she most laudably and eagerly chose what all virgins of Christ do. Not that their fathers agree with them; no – they often even suffer persecution and undeserved reproaches from their parents; and yet their number is every increasing. How many have been reborn there so as to be of our kind, I do not know – not to mention widows and those who practice continence.<br><br>But the greatest is the suffering of those women who live in slavery. All the time they have to endure terror and threats. But the Lord gave His grace to many of His maidens; for, though they are forbidden to do so, they follow him bravely.<br><br>43) Wherefore, then, even if I wished to leave them and go to Britain – and how I would have loved to go to my country and my parents, and also to Gaul [France] in order to visit the brethren and to see the face of the saints of my Lord! God knows it that I much desired it; but I am bound by the Spirit, who gives evidence against me if I do this, telling me that I shall be guilty; and I am afraid of losing the labour which I have begun – nay, not I, but Christ the Lord who bade me come here and stay with them for the rest of my life, if the Lord will, and will guard me from every evil way that I may not sin before Him.<br><br>46) Hence I ought unceasingly to give thanks to God who often pardoned my folly and my carelessness, and on more than one occasion spared His great wrath on me, who was chosen to be His helper and who was slow to do as was shown me and as the Spirit suggested. And the Lord had mercy on me thousands of thousands of times because He saw that I was ready, but that I did not know what to do in the circumstances. For many tried to prevent this my mission; they would even talk to each other behind my back and say: <i>“Why does this fellow throw himself into danger among enemies who have no knowledge of God?”</i> It was not malice, but it did not appeal to them because – and to this I own myself – of my rusticity. And I did not realise at once the grace that was then in me; now I understand that I should have done so before.<br><br>47) Now I have given a simple account to my brethren and fellow servants who have believed me because of what I said and still say in order to strengthen and confirm your faith. Would that you, too, would strive for greater things and do better! This will be my glory, for a wise son is a glory to his father.<br><br>59) And if ever I have done any good for my God whom I love, I beg Him to grant me that I may shed my blood with those exiles and captives for His name, even though I should be denied a grave, or my body be woefully torn to pieces limb by limb by hounds or wild beasts, or the fowls of the air devour it. I am firmly convinced that if this should happen to me, I would have gained my soul together with my body, because on that day without doubt we shall rise in the brightness of the sun, that is, in the glory of Christ Jesus our Redeemer, as sons of the living God and joint heirs with Christ, to be made conformable to His image; for of Him, and in Him we shall reign.<br><br>60) For this sun which we see rises daily for us because He commands so, but it will never reign, nor will its splendour last; what is more, those wretches who adore it will be miserably punished. Not so we, who believe in, and worship, the true sun – Christ – who will never perish, nor will he who doeth His will; but he will abide for ever as Christ abideth for ever, who reigns with God the Father Almighty and the Holy Spirit before time and now, and in all eternity.

                <p> “Why I am not a Roman Catholic,” was a question James Nuechterlein, a Lutheran writer and academic, was addressing sometime ago in the journal <i>First Things </i>(January 1997). As he knew that the 16th century Reformers were not wanting to depart from the Catholic faith but only to reform what was corrupted, he called Lutherans “Evangelical Catholics”. Surely that is right. The Reformers, particularly the English ones, said they wanted to go back to the New Testament Church, and also to early Church teachers where they agreed with the Bible. They were concerned to follow the faith of those biblical “Catholic Creeds” that are still used (the word <i>Catholic </i>was, and is, especially applied to the first four ecumenical councils that produced the creeds in opposition to some heretical groups). So Nuecheterlein wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>“We remain Evangelical Catholics because we have what we consider good reasons not to be Roman Catholics … We have no desire to re-ignite the passions of the sixteenth century, but we think that in the quarrels of the Reformation era the reformers were more right than Rome. Many of those quarrels have been resolved in recent years, but on certain critical issues – such as the relation between justification and sanctification or between Scripture and tradition – differences remain that, however subtle, are not insignificant [italics mine].”</div></blockquote>

<p>There are as well, he went on to say, “a number of post-Reformation issues that separate many Evangelical Catholics from Rome.” These include such important matters as papal infallibility and the Marian dogmas. I, too, share these doctrinal worries and concerns. I would add worries over sacramental theology and practice. Let me highlight one particular issue which shows both agreement and disagreement. <br><br>An excellent statement summarizing the Old Testament in its relation to the New Testament comes from the Roman Catholic <i>Dogmatic Constitution On Divine Revelation “Dei Verbum</i>” of 1965 from the Second Vatican Council and Chapter IV. What follows are sections 14-16. <br><br><b>The Old Testament</b><br><br>“14. In carefully planning and preparing the salvation of the whole human race the God of infinite love, by a special dispensation, chose for Himself a people to whom He would entrust His promises. First He entered into a covenant with Abraham (see Gen. 15:18) and, through Moses, with the people of Israel (see Ex. 24:8). To this people which He had acquired for Himself, He so manifested Himself through words and deeds as the one true and living God that Israel came to know by experience the ways of God with men. Then too, when God Himself spoke to them through the mouth of the prophets, Israel daily gained a deeper and clearer understanding of His ways and made them more widely known among the nations (see Ps. 21:29; 95:1-3; Is. 2:1-5; Jer. 3:17). The plan of salvation foretold by the sacred authors, recounted and explained by them, is found as the true word of God in the books of the Old Testament: these books, therefore, written under divine inspiration, remain permanently valuable. "For all that was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope" (Rom. 15:4).<br><br>15. The principal purpose to which the plan of the old covenant was directed was to prepare for the coming of Christ, the redeemer of all and of the messianic kingdom, to announce this coming by prophecy (see Luke 24:44; John 5:39; 1 Peter 1:10), and to indicate its meaning through various types (see 1 Cor. 10:12). Now the books of the Old Testament, in accordance with the state of mankind before the time of salvation established by Christ, reveal to all men the knowledge of God and of man and the ways in which God, just and merciful, deals with men. These books, though they also contain some things which are incomplete and temporary, nevertheless show us true divine pedagogy. These same books, then, give expression to a lively sense of God, contain a store of sublime teachings about God, sound wisdom about human life, and a wonderful treasury of prayers, and in them the mystery of our salvation is present in a hidden way. Christians should receive them with reverence.<br><br>16. God, the inspirer and author of both Testaments, wisely arranged that the New Testament be hidden in the Old and the Old be made manifest in the New. For, though Christ established the new covenant in His blood (see Luke 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25), still the books of the Old Testament with all their parts, caught up into the proclamation of the Gospel, acquire and show forth their full meaning in the New Testament (see Matt. 5:17; Luke 24:27; Rom. 16:25-26; 2 Cor. 14:16) and in turn shed light on it and explain it.”<br><br><b>“Together with sacred tradition”</b><br><br>That is a most helpful statement in Chapter IV. However, in VI, 21 is this: </p>

<blockquote><div>“[The Church] has always maintained them [the Scriptures], and continues to do so, together with sacred tradition, as the supreme rule of faith, since, as inspired by God and committed once and for all to writing, they impart the word of God Himself without change, and make the voice of the Holy Spirit resound in the words of the prophets and Apostles. Therefore, like the Christian religion itself, all the preaching of the Church must be nourished and regulated by Sacred Scripture. For in the sacred books, the Father who is in heaven meets His children with great love and speaks with them; and the force and power in the word of God is so great that it stands as the support and energy of the Church, the strength of faith for her sons, the food of the soul, the pure and everlasting source of spiritual life. Consequently these words are perfectly applicable to Sacred Scripture: ‘For the word of God is living and active’ (Heb. 4:12) and ‘it has power to build you up and give you your heritage among all those who are sanctified’ (Acts 20:32; see 1 Thess. 2:13) [italics mine].”</div></blockquote>

<p>So much wisdom is there. <i>But </i>to add tradition to the Bible as “the supreme rule of faith” confuses. What happens when the Bible and tradition are in conflict? Which trumps which? That, of course, is a fundamental issue. In simple terms there is a distinction between Scripture (the Bible), tradition (the teaching of the Church in addition to the Bible) and reason (what seems reasonable in a given age – recognizing that that differs from age to age, depending on the assumptions of any given age). Some say it is like a three-legged stool, with the Bible, Tradition and Reason being the legs. But not all are equal. That is not a good analogy. Let me explain. It is obvious that we need all three, the Bible, the Church’s teaching and human intelligence. We need the teaching of Jesus and his apostles (the Bible); we need the wisdom of other Christians to help us (including - and especially in a “post-modern age” - the wisdom of Christians of previous generations); and we must use our minds (even in writing and reading this). The very simple question is, “which trumps which?”<br><br>Of course, you use your mind and make allowances for where the Bible itself teaches there is progressive revelation. Of course, you learn from what other Christians say and have said. You then discover the Bible is quite clear over some issue. But then a given group of Christians teach something that is contradicting this clear teaching of the Bible. Or your world’s “plausibility structure” has so conditioned the culture that people have “absorbed” axioms or assumptions that make them argue against some clear teaching of the Bible (currently at the moment a big issue is homosexual sex). Which trumps which - the Bible, one group of Christians (even a whole Church), or what seems reasonable to one age (which varies from age to age)? To be a Christian means, <i>for a range of good reasons</i>, you are going to follow Jesus Christ and his apostles (the Bible). The Bible is going to be trumps. Or put less colloquially, the Bible will be your supreme authority (full stop). To add “together with sacred tradition” makes it no longer supreme.<br><br><b>Cardinal Newman</b><br><br>Newman, “beatified” recently, was brilliant in writing about liberalistic intellectual fashions that make reason supreme. He said this: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Liberalism in religion is the doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion, but that one creed is as good as another, and this is the teaching which is gaining substance and force daily. It is inconsistent with any recognition of any religion as true. It teaches that all are to be tolerated, for all are matters of opinion. Revealed religion is not a truth, but a sentiment and a taste; not an objective fact, not miraculous; and it is the right of each individual to make it say just what strikes his fancy … Since, then, religion is so personal a peculiarity and so private a possession, we must of necessity ignore it in the intercourse of man with man. If a man puts on a new religion every morning, what is that to you? It is as impertinent to think about a man's religion as about his sources of income or his management of his family. Religion is in no sense the bond of society.” </div></blockquote>

<p>But my argument with Newman is that he rightly opposed a liberalism that denied much of the Bible and subtracted from the Bible. However, he supported non-Biblical additions which, surely, err in the other direction. He had to support Papal infallibility (which he was not happy with). He was, of course, dead when Pope Pius XII “infallibly defined” on 1 November 1950 the dogma that Mary “having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory”. What would Newman have said then? <br><br>Let’s all pray for continuing reform in both Roman and Protestant churches.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Education and the Christian Faith">(December 2010) Education and the Christian Faith</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2010</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>The cultural historian Christopher Dawson once wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote><div>“In politics Christianity can accommodate itself to any system of government and can survive under the most severe forms of despotism and autocracy. And in the same way, it is not bound to any economic system and has in the past existed and expanded in a world of slavery as well as in a world of freedom, under feudalism and capitalism and state socialism. But if it loses the right to teach it can no longer exist.”</div></blockquote>

<p>That was written at the beginning of the 1960s, forty years before many Christian parents in Britain seemed to have lost “the right” for their children to be educated in state schools within the Christian tradition. By the end of the 20th century and in this first decade of the 21st century Christians were even being attacked for expressing the Christian faith in schools. By 2009 a child could be disciplined for talking about Jesus Christ and eternity in school and the child’s mother lose her job for writing to friends to pray about the situation – witness Jennie Cain’s experience at Landscore Primary School, Devon, where she was on the staff and her daughter a pupil. But should Christians expect state schools to be other than totally secularist or at best lowest common denominator “multifaith”? The answer is most certainly “Yes.” <br><br>The latest figures from the Government on religion and religious affiliation are the September 2010 figures from the <i>Integrated Household Survey </i>of the Office of National Statistics (ONS). These came from nearly half a million people. In answer to the question: “What is your religion even if you are not currently practising?” the response was 71% Christian, 20% “no religion at all”, and 8% for all other religions – the options being “Buddhist”, “Hindu”, “Jewish”, “Muslim”, “Sikh” and “any other religion” (Muslims were 4%).<br><br>It is true that when you use a stronger test according to the latest independent and smaller NatCen survey, in answer to the question: “Do you regard yourself as <i>belonging </i>to any particular religion?” you get 50% saying Christian and 43% saying “no religion”. But sociologists have long been arguing that in Britain, for a range of reasons, there is a phenomenon of “believing without belonging” (this may be related to what some are calling “vicarious religion”). So secularists and others should not argue only from “belonging” figures and give them great publicity in the media to suggest a further marginalization of the Christian faith, as is done. This is hardly being responsible. For there still seems to be a significant desire to be associated with the Christian faith rather than with secularism as indicated by the ONS. This should be understood in academia. But there, the Christian faith is perhaps even more marginalized (at the tertiary or university level of education) than at the primary and secondary school levels. Certainly in Britain today too many teachers coming out of the colleges seem quite unaware of two facts. One is that the tradition of Western education that has led the world and that others are wanting to imitate is a Christian tradition. The other fact is that this Christian tradition, undoubtedly, has been responsible for the democratic freedoms and progress enjoyed in the West and that these others are also envying. <br><br><b>The first fact</b><br><br>Take the first of those two facts. The church had pioneered education in the West and in Britain. In the North East our Anglo-Saxon ancestors had established one of the great centres of learning in Europe at the monastery in Jarrow in the 8th century. Then Alfred the Great inaugurated a remarkable programme of Christian education in the 9th. At Oxford there is even a claim that he founded University College. The result was that at school and university level (except for University College London, founded 1826) education was generally Christian and church led. Then in 1870 the state in Britain began to play a significant part. How church and state schools should relate was resolved as the Second World War was drawing to a close. The justly famous 1944 Education Act led to a new educational church-state partnership. When Lord Selbourne introduced in the House of Lords the 1944 Bill that laid the foundation for modern education in Britain, he said this (with Hitler as yet undefeated):</p>

<blockquote><div>“The real enemy is naked materialistic paganism which has reared its head in Europe to a height unknown for a 1,000 years which threatens Christianity today and with it our civilization, our homes and our people ... Anglo-Saxon democracy would perish without the Christian ethic and unless we are brought up to be a God-fearing Christian nation, all our vaunted progress in other directions will crumble into dust.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The church’s agreement in 1944 to go in with the government was based on state schools having non-denominational Christian education and daily prayers. In 1988 the Education Reform Act (and subsequent legislation) endorsed that ethos by insisting on an act of collective worship that is to be “wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character.” Also the 1988 Act said religious education is to “reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian, while taking account of the teachings and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain”.<br><br><b>The second fact</b><br><br>The second fact that people fail to realise is that the Christian tradition (or world-view) has been responsible for democratic freedom and other social goods enjoyed in the West. However, the latest anti-Christian attack on this tradition is by a group including some educationalists, some secularists and some liberal religious people. They are wanting to abolish Christian assemblies in state schools alleging democratic freedom to be the issue. One signatory to a letter to the Secretary of State for Education says: “the issue is a common commitment to freedom of belief. It shouldn’t be the role of the state to enforce or prohibit worship.” Such an argument looks plausible but needs to be resisted.<br><br><i>First</i>, no school is neutral. To think that saying “Jesus is Lord” is being religious while other philosophies are neutral is quite false. For all schools have a positive philosophy whether hard line secularism or a softer “multifaithism”. But neither of these two options is neutral. Not to echo in a school the belief that Jesus is Lord is not being neutral. It is to believe that saying Jesus is Lord is either unnecessary to, or a hindrance to, the school. However, as we have noted - at the moment 71%, it seems, echo that belief. We may assume they would resist hard-line secularism, and also “multifaithism” (if it was explained that it is not compatible with the Christian faith that sees Jesus Christ as the unique and final revelation of God and the only Saviour of the world). <br><br><i>Secondly</i>, this is a matter of great urgency. True liberalism is at stake as are other humanistic values when the Christian faith is marginalized. Lose the Fatherhood of God and you lose the brotherhood of man. Lose humankind as created in the image of God and you lose fundamental democratic human equality. And lose ultimate divine judgment with God allowing people to reject him, and you lose freedom for belief. It is this freedom that currently allows parents to withdraw a child from Christian assemblies and allows a tiny fraction of state schools (0.8% - 200 out of 25,000) to make provision for another faith community’s worship because of their demographics.<br><br><i>Thirdly</i>, and most importantly, you will lose fundamental human rights themselves with the loss of Christian faith. The modern understanding of human rights goes back to the English and American liberal Puritan tradition that sees natural rights as God’s gift. So the American Declaration of Independence claimed “all men are created equal and … endowed <i>by their creator </i>with certain inalienable rights”. But lose that belief in God and you soon reject fundamental natural or human rights (endorsed by the Bible) as “nonsense on stilts”. This is the phrase of the secularist Jeremy Bentham, who attacked the American Declaration. Jefferson, however, defended God-given rights with a question: “can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties were a gift of God?” Unless there is some transcendental anchorage, rights are simply what Parliament votes. So Nazi Parliaments can vote for “a final solution” and immediately Hitler has a legal “right” to exterminate millions of Jews. Unless you have a grounding for human rights that is “above” human governments, all you have left are power struggles and pure utilitarianism which can justify even a Hitler. Had Hitler been successful many would have done so. Thank God, the wickedness of the Nazis re-awakened the world to “God-given human rights” and the folly of Jeremy Bentham. The result was the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the European Convention on Human Rights (1953). All this is why to marginalize the Christian tradition from public life, including public education, is to open the door to a creeping totalitarianism. This denies basic human rights such as some Christians are now experiencing. Some, indeed, are now being arrested for preaching the Christian faith and articulating Christian moral values.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br><i>Finally</i>, why this move to abolish Christian school assemblies must be resisted is this. Individual freedom has to be balanced with collective freedom. The Western liberal tradition is clear that the state may not enforce <i>individual </i>belief. But the state, in a democratic free society, will also need to respect the majority’s freedom from having their beliefs undermined by dissident minorities. At the moment the state, with the impossibility of a “naked public square” and the majority of parents identifying with the Christian tradition, should require that schools help those parents in at least keeping alive their preferred religious tradition. At the same time, of course, it should make provision for parental withdrawal from assemblies. This it does. And, of course, once the Christian principle is established, OFSTED needs to insist it is being adhered to properly and genuinely. That is another matter.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Biblical Reasons for 'Why Look Back?"">(January 2011) Biblical Reasons for "Why Look Back?"</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2011</li><li>Church History and Future</li><li>JPC</li><li>faithfulness</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>2011 sees the 150th Anniversary of the founding of Jesmond Parish Church in memory of Richard Clayton, the great Victorian Tyneside Christian leader. Last September at the JPC 150 Programme Launch Evening I was asked to give biblical reasons for “Why Look Back?” The following is a transcript of what was said.</i><br><br>Looking back is something older people do a lot. So on reaching a 150th birthday you ought to expect a lot of looking back! <br><br>Tragically as some people get older they cannot look back, for their memory has gone. Such a state of amnesia is so sad. It is also sad when people can only look back and never look forward.<br><br><b>Institutional amnesia</b><br><br>But what is true of people is true of institutions and organizations (like churches). On the one hand, there can be institutional amnesia and a failure to look back and learn from the past. Or, on the other hand, there can be a simple dwelling on the past with no looking forward or preparation for the future. What does the Bible have to say about this?<br><br>1 Corinthians 10 is helpful. Paul is reminding the Corinthians of how in the wilderness wanderings the people of God drifted away from the Lord. They sank even (v 7) “to indulge in pagan revelry” which involved, says Paul (v 8), “sexual immorality … and in one day 23,000 of them died.” And he goes on to say there was “testing” of God and “grumbling” - all with dire consequences for the people. But then in verse 11, we read this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfilment of the ages has come.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Paul was saying that the Corinthians should look back to avoid the mistakes and pitfalls of the past. And we too should look back to Scriptural history and learn its lessons. So using that as a template, we can then look back generally – and with profit.<br><br><b>The Founders’ courage, generosity and wisdom</b><br><br>At JPC there is so much to learn from its history. I have selected four lessons.<br><br><i>First</i>, there was the courage of the founders. <br><br>Though publicly abused for wanting to plant our church in the first place (with their opponents calling the church, St Spite’s), they went ahead. <br><br><i>Secondly</i>, there was the generosity of the donors who caught the vision. <br><br>That’s a reminder that God’s work done in God’s way never lacks God’s resources – normally through donors.<br><br><i>Thirdly</i>, there was the wisdom of their vision for this church to be “a central point for …</p>

<blockquote><div>“… the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth”.</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The Founders’ vision</b><br><br>Every word there is vital. We must be concerned for the <i>Truth </i>– about God, man and the world. But today in a post modern world, we need to be specific. So it is <i>Evangelical </i>truth – the truth that is the good news of Jesus Christ. <br><br>But “evangelical” is now a fashionable world meaning all sorts of things. So it is to be “<i>Scriptural </i>and evangelical truth” – the truth from the teaching of Jesus and his Apostles as you find it in the Bible. But “biblical”(or “scriptural”) also is now fashionable for it is possible to say the Bible is true for the first century but needs updating for the 21st century. <br><br>So it is to be “<i>Sound </i>scriptural and evangelical truth”. “Sound” meant for our founders interpreting the Bible in line with the <i>Thirty-nine Articles of Religion </i>of the Church of England. Article XX says, referring to “God’s Word written” that you are not so to …</p>

<blockquote><div>“… expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Because of the wisdom in the <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i>, that is one reason why each year I look back at some of those Articles on our Foundation Sunday. <br><br>But that “sound scriptural and evangelical truth” has to be both <i>Maintained and Proclaimed</i>. If you only maintain it, you get a dead orthodoxy. If you only proclaim it, you can soon loose it. So we can learn from the courage, generosity and wisdom of our Founders.<br><br><b>Warnings</b><br><br>But, <i>fourthly</i>, we need to heed a warning.<br><br>There was a drift of this church in the first part of the 20th century from its founding vision and moorings to a theological low-church-liberalism that would have shocked Richard Clayton. It also had a Masonic emphasis, which now the Church of England officially has declared incompatible with the Christian Faith. And that is why Paul says as you look back, some of those lessons of history you need to take as warnings. So, in 1 Corinthians 10.12 he says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!” </div></blockquote>

<p>Luther said that the Bible has to be fought for every 30 or 40 years. Christopher Dawson said the same about Christian cultures. And the individual Christian’s life has to be fought for <i>every day</i>. Jesus said that we are to pray, “Lead us not into temptation”.<br><br>However, it is not all “just try harder”. No! Listen to how Paul concludes this section of 1 Corinthians 10 in verse 13:</p>

<blockquote><div>“No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.”</div></blockquote>

<p>So looking back is not just about warnings and temptations. It is about winning the fight in the future. Paul makes that clear in Romans 15.4 where he says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.”</div></blockquote>

<p>That means that you look back to God’s plan of salvation in history and how God fulfilled his promises in Christ, the Cross, the Resurrection, the Holy Spirit’s coming and Christ’s current Reign; and you look back to promises of a final complete and glorious fulfilment beyond history for all believers. This is to encourage you for what lies ahead and be positively hopeful as you face the future. But the future will bring challenges. They will be of two sorts. <br><br><b>Future challenges</b><br><br>First, there are those that require “endurance” – “endurance” is literally standing firm under pressure. It is what you need when you have got something positive to do, from important individual tasks at home or work to a great corporate vision - for example, for the future of this church. But everything is conspiring against it.<br><br>The second sort of challenges are when encouragement is required. This is what you need when you wish you <i>had </i>something positive to do, and when thoughts of a wider vision are light years over your head. Just surviving, for you is enough.<br><br>Or you need this sort of encouragement when you simply can’t see a way of solving some problem at home, or at work or at the church. As we look ahead together to 2011 and, God willing, beyond, there will be huge pressures. How we will need endurance and encouragement to stand firm under them. And there will be times when we are discouraged. But God wants us all to be people of hope – in this life and, of course, for eternity.<br><br>And we can be, <i>one</i>, as we look back to the Bible and learn those lessons of history, and as the Holy Spirit applies them to our hearts and minds and gives us the endurance to stand firm and be positively encouraged, in spite of all the challenges we will have to face.<br><br>And we can be people of hope, <i>two</i>, as we avoid the pitfalls of those in the wilderness and of some in our own JPC history, but are encouraged by the example of our Founders’ courage, generosity and wisdom.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Christian and Money">(February 2011) The Christian and Money</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2011</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>(This article by the former principal of Moore College, Sydney, has been abbreviated by DRJH and is published with permission of </i>The Briefing<i>)</i><br><br><b>The Bible</b><br><br>Money figures largely in our thoughts. We occupy a lot of time thinking about it, about how much we have got, how much we need, how much we earn, how much we spend. The New Testament also has a lot to say about money, and what it says is quite remarkable because it is the opposite to what we normally think about money.<br><br>Before we examine what it says we need to ask ourselves whether we are willing to accept God's thoughts on the subject of money when these are clearly announced in the pages of the Bible and particularly taught by Jesus himself. Does God the Creator know more about the management of money than we do, and are we willing to accept his words as the rule for our conduct in this subject to which we give so much of our attention? Christian obedience means complete obedience and not only in those things where we happen to agree with God. Christian faith means trusting God even when our own views seem to suggest the contrary.<br><br>The <i>first </i>thing to note in the Bible teaching about money is that affluence is unimportant. Jesus taught this very clearly when he said, "A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions" (Lk 12:15). From this it follows that the first virtue to be cultivated with regard to the handling of money is the virtue of contentment. Thus, Paul teaches clearly that having food and clothing, with these we should be content (1 Tim 6:8). His remarks are in the context of his condemnation of Christians who think that the Christian life, and particularly the Christian ministry, is a way of making money and becoming rich. Godliness with contentment - that is the apostle's recipe for living; and what wonderful peace it brings, complete release from the rat-race. We are to live within our circumstances, for our circumstances are God-given. God is sovereign. The silver and gold are his. He is able to multiply money if we need it, as easily as he multiplied the loaves and fishes on the hillside in Galilee, or as he multiplies the grain by turning it into the ear of corn through his rain and his sunshine and the fertile soil of his creation. If we look after God's affairs, he will look after us.<br><br>The <i>second </i>point about money that the Bible underlines is an obvious one, namely that affluence is unreliable. We can lose it quickly, and we all lose it at all events at death or in old age when it is no use to us (as we are too weak to do anything with it). Jesus, therefore, warned his disciples not to be rich in this world but rather to be rich in the next, rich towards God. He told the story of the rich farmer whose fields had produced abundant harvests. Instead of thanking God he simply said, "What will I do? I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, 'Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry'." But God said to him, "Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?" And Jesus added, "So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God" (Lk 12:18-21).<br><br>Money tempts us very strongly to put our trust in it, but it is a very uncertain thing, and after all it is completely under God's control. Thus, the apostle tells Timothy, "As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God who richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy" (1 Tim 6:17). They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal and generous, thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed.<br><br>Affluence is unreliable. It is a snare to rely on money for the future. Our trust must be in God, who is in charge of our future and who will supply our needs, because he cares for us.<br><br><b>Sharing, greed and fear</b><br><br>In considering the Christian use of money it is important to realise that we must act responsibly in the use of the money under our control. The <i>first principle </i>that we may mention is that we must be willing to share our money with those in real need whom God's providence brings within the orbit of our life. It is not as though we have to go without in order that others might have affluence, but rather that we might share our blessings with those who have need of our help.<br><br>There are <i>two great obstacles </i>to sharing. The first is <i>greed</i>. We want more and more for ourselves. Greed is self-centred, and can only be cured by God. We must call upon him in prayer to give us his Holy Spirit so that our attitudes to life may agree with his character. God himself is a giving God. He gives us everything to enjoy fully. He has given us his Son to be our saviour. When we love God we will be able to love our brother, so we will rise above the greedy and selfish use of our money. Greediness grows if encouraged. We may be surprised how greedy we have become without noticing it. Of course, gambling is essentially greed, and an individual or a community that indulges in gambling (and it doesn't matter how small the sum) will become more and more greedy, and therefore less and less inclined to help one another in times of need. It is sad that the Government is encouraging this vice of greed in order to obtain revenue. Moreover, the greedy person is not a happy person. He or she is never satisfied with his self-centredness.<br><br>The other obstacle to sharing our money is <i>fear</i>. We are frightened that we wi1l leave ourselves short if we give it away; not short perhaps in the present, because we can estimate that, but in the future with all its uncertainties. The answer to this sort of fear is faith in God's faithfulness in the future. It is he who has given us our present possessions and he has promised that, if we seek to do his will, he will give to us what we need when we need it. God is in control of every event in our world, including the business world, and the world of our own private life. He has promised us a wonderful heavenly inheritance, and Christians should live in the light of that promise. He has promised provision for the rest of life that is this side of heaven, and we should live in the light of this promise as well. So when you are tempted to hesitate in helping other people in their real need as you come across the need, remember God's promise to be faithful. He who has given us life will give us the means to sustain life and not only our life, but the life of our children too. Indeed, as St Paul says, the love of God is such that we have no grounds for fear. He wrote, "God who spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not freely with him give us every thing?" We have a great inheritance in the future. Christ has provided it through his death, and we have already begun to enjoy it through his Spirit. If we keep our thoughts on this inheritance, we won't clutch to ourselves what God has given us in this life, but will share it with generosity. Sharing is the first great principle in the use of our money.<br><br><b>Service</b><br><br>In considering the Christian's use of his money, <i>another principle </i>to be remembered is that no-one, whether Christian or non-Christian, should ever have as a primary aim the aim to make money. This is because such an aim, when it is the primary aim, is self-centred and we should never be self-centred in our actions towards others. The use of money, whether in business or in any other way, should be with the object of service. This is the principle exemplified by Jesus Christ, the Son of God "who is among you as one who serves". If we aim primarily at making money when we are in contact with other people, we aim at something selfish; we are looking to our own self interests rather than the interests of those with whom we are in contact, and this remains true whether we expand the concept of self into self and family, or into religious objectives in which we are interested.<br><br>Consequently, in our use of money, whether we are conducting a business or developing a property or investing in shares, our primary aim and motive must never be to make money but rather to see how we can serve other people with the money God has put in our control. This applies to all people but especially, of course, to Christians and the Christian church.<br><br>For example, if we have a block of land which we wish to develop, it must not be primarily to make money from it; but we must ask ourselves whether through the development we are serving the community. Similarly, if we are landlords, we must, in conducting our business with our tenants, not primarily aim to make money out of them but rather to serve them. If we are businessmen, our business must be conducted to confer benefit on our customers, and similarly directors of public companies must not be primarily interested in the size of the profit which they are able to announce in their annual report to the shareholders, but they must be primarily concerned with the people their company comes into contact with through its business. All this does not mean that we are not to make money. Of course we need to make a profit if we are going to maintain our home and family, and if we are going to have money to invest for the better development of community resources; but the primary aim and motivation of our actions when we are in relation to other people must not be to make money but rather to serve those other people.<br><br>The money under our control, or the property which we own, is simply that part of God's creation which we have the responsibility for using. And we must use it in accordance with the character of God, its creator.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Judge, Secularism, Pluralism and Fundamentalism">(March 2011) A Judge, Secularism, Pluralism and Fundamentalism</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2011</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>“The laws and usages of the realm”</b><br><br>On 28 February 2011 the BBC had a news item about a “Mr and Mrs Johns [who] said they could not tell a child homosexuality was an acceptable lifestyle.” This they were required to do if they were to be foster parents. The report said: “a Christian couple opposed to homosexuality have lost a battle over their right to become foster carers. Eunice and Owen Johns, 62 and 65, from Derby, said the city council did not want them to look after children because of their traditional views.” The whole case seemed confused and confusing. But at one point the judge said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Although historically this country is part of the Christian west, and although it has an established church which is Christian, there have been enormous changes in the social and religious life of our country over the last century. Our society is now pluralistic and largely secular. But one aspect of its pluralism is that we also now live in a multi-cultural community of many faiths. One of the paradoxes of our lives is that we live in a society which has at one and the same time become both increasingly secular but also increasingly diverse in religious affiliation. We sit as secular judges serving a multi-cultural community of many faiths. We are sworn (we quote the judicial oath) to "do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of this realm, without fear or favour, affection or ill will." But the laws and usages of the realm do not include Christianity, in whatever form.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The arguing on all sides in this case left much to be desired. But I was amazed to find a British judge concluding that “the laws and usages of the realm do not include Christianity, in whatever form”. For a number of years I was a chairman of the General Synod of the Church of England. The General Synod, is empowered to pass Measures which after consideration by the Ecclesiastical Committee of Parliament become Statute Law and have the same force as Acts of Parliament. So the General Synod has to spend a considerable time on legislative business. A significant Measure, for example, is the “<i>Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974</i>”. This defines the doctrine of the Church of England as that of Canon A5 which says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Secularisation and pluralism</b><br><br>But how secular and how pluralist are we and what do these terms really signify?<br><br>Secularization was a theory that the more “modern” a society became, the less religious it would be. This fitted in with an Enlightenment view of progress, namely that as the world “matured” it would throw out religion like a child-hood toy and be free of such “superstition”. But since the 1970s it has been seen how wrong that theory was. For worldwide there has been an explosion of religious activity and growth (with the exception of western and central Europe and a small global band of influential intelligentsia, often western educated). <br><br>But secularization theory was correct over one thing. It did see that modernization undermined a significant amount of accepted beliefs. It was wrong, however, to assume that this loss of belief was due to secularization. It was not. It was due to pluralization.<br><br>Pluralization occurs with the erosion of traditional societies. Traditional societies by definition have enduring world views and morality. They are geographically separate and protected from other societies and so from any “cognitive contamination” (the undermining of those views and values). But once there are human migrations coupled with urbanization people have to live together and interact. This means that worldviews and morality become less “taken for granted”. For as communication through various media increases – first printing, then the telephone, after that radio, films, TV and now the internet – so does pluralism. People are now so simply and so easily made aware of other people’s beliefs and morals whether they like them or not. <br><br>And pluralism relativizes. This happens because there is a level of “cognitive negotiation” as people discuss and argue about worldviews and morality. This, however, leads on to that “cognitive contamination” where views and values get diluted. This happens on all sides. The result then is that the individual is confronted with a range of choices from a new market place of beliefs and behaviours with no “society with a tradition” to guide or help. For such traditional societies are being de-institutionalized. This occurs as the institutions within them disintegrate. For example, institutions like “marriage” and “the family” that support individuals through law, social expectations and accepted norms of behaviour begin to break down. This forces the individual to rely simply on his or her own strengths and abilities for marital and family success without any social support. For many the challenge is too great and societies themselves start to disintegrate. As the sociologist Peter Berger writes: “every functioning society requires a certain degree of normative consensus lest it fall apart”. When such a consensus is lost many advocate a return to the “old paths”, hence the rise of “fundamentalist” movements in all the religions. <br><br><b>Fundamentalism and Islam</b><br><br>“Fundamentalist” is a pejorative term because in Protestantism it has been associated with obscurantism and a lack of rational thought. But the writers of the original “Fundamentals”, early 20th century essays against the destructive theological liberalism of the 19th century, were often by distinguished academics. Furthermore, some of today’s Muslim “fundamentalists” are anything but obscurantist or irrational. James Davison Hunter quotes “the critical figure in Islamic extremism … Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian intellectual who, more than anyone else, theorized the rationale for contemporary Islamic radicalism. In his book <i>Milestones</i>, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><div>‘Mankind today is on the brink of a precipice, not because of the danger of complete annihilation which is hanging over its head – this being just a symptom and not the real disease – but because humanity is devoid of those vital values which are necessary not only for its healthy development but also for its real progress. Even the western world realizes that western civilization is unable to present any healthy values for the guidance of mankind. It knows that it does not possess anything which will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence … If we look at the sources and foundations of modern ways of living, it becomes clear that the whole world is steeped in Jahiliyya [pagan ignorance of divine guidance]; and all the marvellous material comforts and high level inventions do not diminish this Ignorance. This Jahiliyya is based on rebellion against God’s sovereignty on earth; it transfers to man one of the greatest attributes of God, namely sovereignty, and makes some men lords over others. It is now not in that simple and primitive form of the ancient Jahiliyya, but takes the form of claiming that the right to create values, to legislate rules of collective behaviour, and to choose any way of life rests with men, without regard to what God has prescribed. The result of this rebellion against the authority of God is the oppression of His creatures …The Islamic civilization can take various forms in its material and organizational structure, but the principles and values on which it is based are eternal and unchangeable. These are the worship of God alone, the foundation of human relationships on the belief in the Unity of God, the supremacy of the humanity of man over material things, the development of human values and the control of animalistic desires, respect for the family, the assumption of the vice-regency of God on earth according to His guidance and instruction, and in all affairs of this vice-regency, the rule of God’s law [al-Shari’a] and the way of life prescribed by Him … (italics added).’”</div></blockquote>

<p>Qutb says that Islam is “the only system which possesses [the] values and … the way of life” capable of resisting this wilful ignorance. And he is very persuasive. <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Christians would agree with much of Qutb’s analysis but disagree with his conclusion. The issue is, where do you discover “what God has prescribed”? Qutb would say “the Koran” and in Jihad. We would say, “the Bible” and non violence. And Qutb’s “Unity of God” excludes Jesus! The public policy advocated by biblical Christians is so very different from the public policy in a Shari’a state. Qutb will be supported by those Pakistanis supporting the murders of Salman Taseer and, on 2 March, of Shahbaz Bhatti, the Government Minister, who were working for a reform of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. These can sentence you to death for criticizing Islam, as the farmhand Asia Bibi was sentenced. There is, therefore, an urgent need to distinguish between so called “fundamentalisms”. Also in the UK it will be important to look again at the results of the new National Census soon to be taken. The latest figures (September 2010) from the Office of National Statistics for religious identity in Britain are that 71% are Christian, 8% are of non-Christian religions (with Muslims 4%) while 21% have no religion. With such a small number of other faiths and only 21% secular Lord Justice Munby was surely incorrect to say that Britain is “largely secular”; nor is “a multi-cultural community of many faiths” a judicial description.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Limits and Dangers of Scientific Reasoning">(April 2011) The Limits and Dangers of Scientific Reasoning</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2011</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>Preaching on Creation and Genesis 1 on 6 March (see www.church.org.uk “sermons” – for a transcript) I realized more needed to be said. Here are a few further convictions on <b>“modern science”</b>.</i><br><br>Modern science is science since the Reformation. It was born out of a revolt against Aristotle (the Greek genius and polymath) by many of the Reformers (excluding Richard Hooker, the Anglican Reformer). Some mediaeval scholasticism had so married Aristotle to the Bible that many Reformers felt the Bible was now obscured. Luther put it bluntly: “a man cannot become a theologian unless he becomes one without Aristotle … compared with the study of theology, the whole of Aristotle is as darkness is to the light.”<br><br>But was Luther right? Can Aristotle be so easily dismissed? Aristotle believed that for an adequate explanation of phenomena you need to give “four causes” or explanatory factors. Of these four the two that make the most sense for today are the “efficient cause” (say “a carpenter” who makes a table) and the “final cause” (which we would call a purpose, “having something to eat off” – that is “why” the table was made). Two other causes, however, were also felt important to identify for a full explanation, the “material” cause (the “wood” used in making the table) and the “formal” cause (the background concept of “a table”). But such an explanatory model was felt by some to be too constricting. So the Reformers general rejection of Aristotle gave permission to scientists (or “natural philosophers” as they were then called) to ignore these “four causes”. Isaac Newton and the rest of the founders of modern science were now free to have their own simple scheme of primary and secondary “efficient” causes. That is where God is said to be the creator and first cause, but he uses secondary causes to achieve his purposes in the world – natural laws and the like. This is spelt out in the Presbyterian Westminster Confession (V§2):</p>

<blockquote><div>Although, in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, the first cause, all things come to pass immutably and infallibly; yet, by the same providence, he ordereth them to fall out according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently (italics mine).</div></blockquote>

<p>Focusing on secondary causes meant more time for scientists to experiment instead of sitting at a desk or in a monastery cell having to think about God, the "efficient" cause, or any "final" causes ("why" as distinct from "how" questions). It was this freedom that contributed to the rise of modern science. Modern science was, therefore, born of two convictions: one that the universe was the rational product of a rational mind, and, two, that the mind of this maker was not bound at every turn by the deductive syllogisms of the scholastics. So the best way for a scientist to determine how the Creator had done things was to turn to nature and examine it carefully. But this new scheme had its problems. Listen to Francis Bacon – a contemporary of Hooker and the first philosopher of modern science (he was writing on the temptations which would indeed be very powerful): "Undoubtedly a superficial tincture of philosophy [<i>he means the new science</i>] may incline the mind to atheism … For on the threshold of philosophy [<i>or science</i>], where second causes appear to absorb the attention, some oblivion of the highest cause [<i>God, the primary cause</i>] may ensue." However, he then went on to say that “a farther knowledge brings it [<i>the mind</i>] back to religion” for "when the mind goes deeper" it sees that these primary and secondary causes are all connected and depend on one another in the providence of God. That is fine if people do go deeper. But the success of discovering secondary causes in mechanics and the application of them in all sorts of technologies has indeed led (as Bacon predicted) to atheism – witness people like Richard Dawkins who, denying “final” causes as well as the “primary” cause, provide inadequate, because partial, and so misleading cosmologies and accounts of origins.<br><br><b>Bondage to the mathematical proof</b><br><br>The heart of the new science was mathematics. So Newton’s great work, following on from medieval scholars, was called the <i>Principia Mathematica </i>– mathematical principles. This contains the statement of Newton’s laws of motion as well as his law of universal gravitation; and because he developed a sure procedure and an agreed way of testing hypotheses, physics became a separate science and its practitioners, by the time of the nineteenth century were called “physicists”. Under Aristotle everything was philosophy; but over the centuries when in any area there was a sure method of procedure and an agreed way of testing hypotheses, you had a new science and the first “… ist” or “… ologist”. <br><br>However, because of the success of Newton’s physics, many came to think that not only all science but every field of learning had to have the equivalent of mathematical reasoning to be respectable. They thought everyone should try to model their procedures and methods of testing hypotheses on the methods of physics and mathematics. This was foolish. It was particularly foolish in theology. But this is what one of the Fathers, if not <i>the </i>Father, of liberal theology, Gotthold Lessing (1729-81), together with many liberals ever since, have indeed thought. Lessing was the German theologian who directly influenced the <i>Essays and Reviews </i>of seven English theologians that were published in 1860. This book has been said to mark the start of modern liberalism in the Church of England. The first article in the book was by Frederick Temple, later an Archbishop of Canterbury, and entitled <i>The Education of the World. </i>This seems to have been influenced by Lessing’s <i>The Education of the Human Race</i>. Lessing’s own fame had come from a short piece entitled <i>On the Proof of the Spirit and of Power</i>. In this he argued his famous thesis that “<i>accidental truths of history can never become the proof of necessary truths of reason</i>.” The late Professor Henry Chadwick, a great 20th century theologian, said of this essay: “it may be doubted whether any writing equally influential in the history of modern religious thought has been marked by a comparable quantity of logical ambiguity.” That is polite “professor-speak” for saying it is nonsense. <br><br>Lessing seems to be distinguishing and contrasting “accidental truths of history” (past events that happened) from “necessary truths of reason” (like the truths of mathematics or logic). He is saying, therefore, that “the truth about the past can never be established by a ‘proof’ such as we can have in mathematics or logic”. But that is so obvious. However, the implied conclusion that has undermined the faith (or the potential faith) of millions, a conclusion still advocated by liberal bishops and clergy together with secular educationalists and government ministers, is this: “We, therefore, cannot be certain about the past and we cannot ‘prove’ that things in the past happened; so, for example, we can never be sure about the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus.” Of course, it is an illegitimate position but it is heard again and again (and no doubt will be heard again this Easter on Radio and TV and in the Press).<br><br><b>Sufficient certainty</b><br><br>Yes, certainty comes from proof; and with regard to something in the past, it is reasonable to want to prove that it happened. But to assume that for history there is <i>only one way of “proving”</i>- as in mathematics (or logic) - <i>is</i> sheer nonsense. Mathematics is one thing. History is another. What we have to do is to “prove” things in ways that are <i>appropriate </i>to whatever it is we are trying to prove. Proof in the physical sciences when an experiment works under specified conditions is quite unlike “logical” proof, which is unlike “proof” in a court of law, which is unlike Janet “proving” she loves John. For certainty you need <i>appropriate </i>proof, not proof of a quasi-mathematical sort. Lessing, however, went one stage further. He suggested it was unreasonable to make <i>commitments </i>on the basis of historical facts. Such was the bewitchment of “pure reason” or “logical, mathematical reasoning”. He said this: </p>

<blockquote><div>“We all believe that an Alexander lived who in a short time conquered almost all Asia. But who, on the basis of this belief, would risk anything of great, permanent worth, the loss of which would be irreparable? ... Certainly not I. Now I have no objection to raise against Alexander and his victory; but it might still be possible that the story was founded on a mere poem of Choerilus.”</div></blockquote>

<p>There is, of course, not much doubt about Alexander. But as the historicity of Alexander is, usually, of little importance and Choerilus now seems to have lived before Alexander was born (and nothing, if anything, has survived of what he wrote), I, too, would not take a great risk on him. However, the historicity of Jesus Christ will be of supreme importance if he is God incarnate. Furthermore, the New Testament documents have survived as evidence. Christ’s historicity matters. Some risks may have to be taken.<br><br>This was the contention of Bishop Butler, an eighteenth century Bishop of Durham. His view was that in practical affairs we have to make commitments on “probabilities”. Certainty only comes afterwards. I commit myself, for example, to a train at London’s Kings Cross station after all the evidence points to the fact that it is the train for Newcastle upon Tyne. My certainty is <i>sufficient</i>. I cannot for ever be “making sure” that the electronic departure board is not playing tricks, or that I am not hallucinating or that the station staff are, indeed, telling the truth to passengers. If I do, I will miss my train. But after York, I am certain I am on the Newcastle train and not the Leeds train by accident. It is the same with fundamental biblical events like the virginal conception of Jesus and his Resurrection leaving a tomb empty. The evidence is sufficient. It is not watertight in a mathematical sense. But we cannot for ever be asking questions. We have to make a commitment on sufficient certainty. That is reasonable. Not to do so is not clever <i>but unreasonable</i>. You become certain in such ultimate areas as you go through life <i>after </i>that commitment. As Jesus said: “If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own” (John 7.17).<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Chrisitan Institute's Questions And Answers On The Referendum Over Alternative Voting (AV)">(May 2011) The Chrisitan Institute's Questions And Answers On The Referendum Over Alternative Voting (AV)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2011</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>[Can I commend to you the <i>Christian Institute’s </i>Questions and Answers concerning the May Referendum on Alternative Voting which some may already have seen. It is also available on line at www.christian.org.uk. You there can see the references that for space reasons I have had to omit. <br><br>Last May (2010) I made available as a </i>Coloured Supplement <i>part of the Institute’s Election Briefing with the following comment: “We are living at a critical time both in Western and British history. In the West there is creeping totalitarianism on the part of Governments. In Britain Fundamental liberties are being denied on the one hand, while on the other hand an enforced decadent libertarianism is causing social and moral chaos. It is vital, therefore, at this election time that Christians both pray and then vote appropriately. I personally thank God for the staff of the Institute for the production of this essential resource for the churches at this time.” Those considerations, I submit, are still important for the forthcoming Referendum. <br><br>And again I would like to thank the Institute for this briefing on Alternative Voting in the form of a “Question and Answer” paper. DRJH]</i><br><br><br>The referendum to change the voting system for elections to the House of Commons takes place on 5 May. The question is whether to adopt the ‘Alternative Vote’ system (AV) instead of the traditional ‘First Past The Post’ system. However low the turnout, the referendum decision will be binding. If the majority of those voting back AV, then that system will be implemented for elections to the House of Commons across the UK. So one way or another, the AV referendum will be decisive. It is therefore important that Christians vote.<br><br><br><b>Q: Is there a Christian position on AV?</b><br><br>On moral issues the Bible is definite, but a particular voting system cannot claim a scriptural mandate. That said, there are biblical principles that apply (see below) and an obvious question is: could a particular voting system marginalise Christian concerns?<br><br>Many say that is precisely what our current First Past The Post system does. Some prominent Christians, such as Tim Farron, President of the Lib Dems,1 back the change to AV, as do some of those involved in Christian political parties. Other Christian politicians such as David Burrowes MP (Conservative) and Gavin Shuker MP (Labour) oppose AV. Ten bishops have backed change to AV, saying it is a ‘fairer voting system’. One self-selected poll carried out last year has been claimed to show that reform of the voting system was “one of the top three political concerns” of Evangelicals at the time of the last general election. John Hayward of the Jubilee Centre has thoughtfully considered the claims of AV in his blog. The think tank <i>Theos </i>has questioned the claims of both sides and concluded that how you vote on AV largely depends on whether you like strong government and decisive elections on the one hand or hung parliaments and cooperation between parties on the other (see appendix 1).<br><br>Much has been written about the pros and cons of AV in the secular press. In this short Q&amp;A discussion paper, we suggest some key issues in the referendum choice for biblical Christians to consider.<br><br><br><b>Q: What is AV?</b><br><br>Currently the British electoral system is based on the First Past The Post system. The voter places a mark on the ballot paper next to the candidate of their choice. Every voter has one vote, which they cast for one candidate. The candidate with the most votes wins. With the AV system candidates are ranked numerically in order of preference. To be elected, a prospective MP must gain more than 50% of votes. If no one crosses that threshold on first preference alone, the least popular candidate is eliminated. The second or, if need be, third or fourth preferences of those who voted for eliminated candidates are included with the existing votes until someone reaches the 50% line. It is then deemed that the winner on this basis holds an overall majority in the constituency.<br><br><br><b>Q: Where else is AV used?</b><br><br>The AV system is in force for national government elections in three countries worldwide – Australia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.<br><br><br><b>Q: How are votes counted under AV?</b><br><br>The Electoral Reform Society has suggested that in around a third of all seats one candidate will immediately secure 50% of the first choice votes cast. For the other cases AV hinges on using the second and third etc preference votes from those who back the least popular candidates.<br><br>So if in one such constituency voters backed Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green candidates in that order on first preference votes, then the Green candidate would be eliminated. The second preference votes on those ballot papers for the eliminated candidate would then be used to top up the votes of the other three. Second and third etc preference votes are only counted for voters whose first choice candidate is eliminated in each successive round of counting. For many ballot papers, second and third etc preference votes will never be used because their first choice candidate is too popular to be eliminated before a decision is reached. The 50% level for the successful candidate is reached by a combination of first preference votes and whatever second, third etc preference votes are counted.<br><br>Supporters of First Past The Post say AV gives many votes to those voting for an unpopular candidate and potentially only one vote to those voting for the most popular. Certainly, some surprising results can emerge depending on how preference votes are used by supporters of the different candidates. It is correct to say that the winning candidate could actually have come third on first preference votes. After the recent Australian election conducted under AV, incumbent Labour Prime Minister Julia Gillard was able to continue in her position by forming a coalition, despite the Liberal-National Coalition receiving more first preference votes.<br><br><br><b>Q: Are you forced to vote for other candidates you disagree with as a Christian?</b><br><br>No. If you want to vote for only one candidate you still can. You would put a ‘1’ by that candidate’s name and leave the rest of the ballot paper blank. But under AV the fewer candidates you rank, the less influence you may have on the outcome.<br><br><br><b>Q: Will Christians still be able to exercise their conscience in choosing a candidate?</b><br><br>Yes. You are free to make choices based on who the candidates are. Because both AV and First Past The Post retain the link with the constituency they allow people to vote for an individual rather than just choose a party from a list (as with the European Elections). Under First Past The Post Christians can positively vote for a particular candidate or a particular party. But many Christians tend to vote for who they see as the least worst candidate. If this is your approach, things are more involved under AV. You still vote for your preferred candidate, but fully to use your ballot you may also need to decide on who is the second least worst candidate, the third least worst and so on.<br><br><br><b>Q: Will Christians be able to exercise their conscience in choosing which manifesto to support for the next government?</b><br><br>Some Christians base their vote on a party rather than a candidate – in doing so they make their choice using a party’s policy manifesto. You can still vote in this way under AV but many, including constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor, believe that AV will lead to more coalition governments. As <i>Theos </i>pointed out, some might consider this to be a good reason to support AV whereas others might prefer to retain the current system. Coalition governments mean that party negotiations conducted after the election will tend to decide what policies are implemented. The AV referendum itself was not in either the Conservative or Lib Dem manifesto but is the product of the negotiation which took place between the parties. A downside of the inevitable horse trading is that politicians could evade responsibility when the next election comes round again. They can just blame their coalition partners or the compromises needed to form a government.<br><br><br><b>Q: Is AV simple?</b><br><br>The Electoral Commission has published a booklet to explain how it works. AV is criticised for being complicated, but its supporters claim AV is fairer.<br><br><br><b>Q: Will AV make it more likely that Christian parties get seats?</b><br><br>No. AV benefits the main parties because the successful candidate needs to reach the 50% threshold (in most cases this is achieved by using redistributed second and third etc preference votes).<br><br><br><b>Q: Will AV mean that extreme parties like the BNP are more likely to get elected?</b><br><br>No. AV is not proportional representation (PR). Elections to the European Parliament use PR and recently led to the BNP gaining two MEPs.<br><br><br><b>Q: Which parties and candidates are likely to benefit from AV?</b><br><br>The Leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, believes AV will benefit ‘progressive’ parties. ‘Progressives’ are defined by the BBC as socially liberal, and according to the Oxford English Dictionary they are “liberal” and favour “social reform”. Academic research (albeit based on limited data) seems to suggest that the Lib Dems will do well under AV.<br><br><br><b>Q: Who supports AV?</b><br><br>The Labour leadership, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, UKIP, Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party all support AV. Many of these would rather have PR. <br><br>Prominent people such as Richard Dawkins, Eddie Izzard, Jonathan Ross and Joanna Lumley have lent their support to the ‘Yes’ campaign. <br><br>Many prominent figures in the Labour Party oppose AV, as does the Conservative Party, the DUP, the UUP and the TUV.<br><br><br><b>Q: Is AV a stepping stone to further electoral reform?</b><br><br>Not necessarily, but it is fair to say that is what many AV supporters hope.<br><br><br><b>Q: Will AV help candidates with clear moral convictions?</b><br><br>The Electoral Reform Society says AV will lead to candidates being selected who support “broad-church policies”, this being a euphemism for ‘middle of the road’ policies. Whatever advantages a consensual approach may or may not have, when it comes to moral issues there will certainly be pressure on candidates to fudge or keep quiet about their convictions in order to pick up second and third preference votes. The system may also mean that political parties will tend to select candidates who can also appeal to the supporters of their political opponents.<br><br><br><b>Q: Do people want to know candidates’ views on moral issues?</b><br><br>Fifty years ago people tended to vote consistently for one political party which may have been seen as protecting their interests. Today people often switch the way they vote. One reason for this is the rise of ‘issue voting’. This was noted by the Blair government in an official consultation in 1998 on political balance in the Magistracy. The government quoted research by US academic Ronald Inglehart who argues that over the past 50 years, a fundamental change has occurred in basic value priorities in Western societies. Using surveys based on attitudes towards a variety of issues including sex, homosexuality, education, religion, drugs and single parents, he found that certain groups in Western society, having reached a certain standard of living, have begun to focus less on goals which protect economic well being and more on non-economic concerns. The research shows that views on moral issues can change which party people vote for. At one time the political parties were poles apart on economic issues, but largely agreed on issues of personal morality. Today there is a much greater degree of convergence between the parties on economic issues, but a widespread divergence of opinion on moral issues both between the parties and between individual candidates within the same party. It is possible to have a libertarian right-winger and a new Labour candidate who both oppose state support for marriage and are committed to abortion and homosexual rights. A traditional one nation Conservative might have more in common on moral issues with someone from old Labour. Whilst there are a variety of moral views within the parties, generally speaking the views of our political parties are much more secular than those of the general public. <br><br>When Tory politician Chris Grayling spoke out in favour of Christian B&amp;B owners, Labour and Lib Dem politicians demanded that David Cameron take action and require Mr Grayling to recant, which Mr Cameron duly did. Yet B&amp;B owners Mr and Mrs Bull have had huge support amongst the public and in the media. Whilst few MPs have spoken out in favour of the Bulls, it is ironic that some prominent supporters of gay rights such as Michael Portillo and David Starkey have shown no such reluctance to back their case, though disagreeing with their views. There are many other issues where the public is much less influenced by secularism than our MPs. For example, the public would like to see our abortion law made tighter.<br><br><br><b>Q: What scriptural principles are relevant in deciding the mechanism of voting?</b><br><br>The role of government is to restrain evil and promote what is good (Romans 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:14). The great blessing of living in a democracy is that the citizens choose the government. This choice acts as a powerful restraint on government. As Reinhold Niebuhr famously said: “Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man’s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.” <br><br>Governments can legitimately raise taxes and exercise authority. As Christ said: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.” MPs as well as the Government are ‘Caesar’ since the House of Commons makes legislation and holds the Government to account. But in a democracy, the citizens are also part of ‘Caesar’ since they have power to dismiss the government and influence public policy in many ways between elections. In a dictatorship this does not arise. Christians believe in accountability. It could be argued that the influence of electors flows from their ultimate power to remove the government. Others would prefer to see a system which requires greater co-operation between political parties. So a key question for Christians in the UK, privileged as we are to live in a democracy, is whether the voting system helps us to do our job in our role as ‘Caesar’. Is AV an improvement so that electors can better exercise their powers to restrain evil and promote good?<br><br><br><b>Appendix 1<br><br><i>Theos think tank</i></b><br><br>“Those who see democracy as delivered best by a strong government, a strong opposition and the opportunity to deliver a clear judgment on a government’s performance on Election Day are unlikely to see AV as an improvement, or indeed to think that there is any problem at all with the existing system. Even for those who view proportionality as the litmus test for electoral legitimacy AV may only seem a small step forward. Nevertheless, this is not to claim that proponents of change are misguided or simply ‘wrong’. Rather, they have a different view of what makes for a good democracy. Thus, the fact that AV will increase the likelihood of hung parliaments is a positive consequence, as a hung parliament is a clearer expression of the public’s mood today, shifting as it has from two broadly defined and oppositional alternatives to a more complex and plural party system.”<br><br><br><b>Appendix 2<br><br><i>Good politics needs good Opposition</i></b><br><br>AV and First Past The Post devotees debate whether strong government is a good thing. But whatever arguments there may be in favour of more consensual politics, surely all can agree that a crucial element of a democracy is the need for a strong opposition. <br><br>Professor A.D. Lindsay, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in the four years before the Second World War, analysed how our democracy came from Oliver Cromwell and the non-conforming Reformers. Writing in 1929 he argued in his book <i>The Essentials of Democracy </i>that: i. democracy needs a strong opposition “to make articulate and get expressed different … points of view”. ii. at the heart of democracy is “the principle of liberty of conscience and the repudiation of religious coercion”; and, iii. the State should “hinder hindrances” to voluntary organisations like churches that can sustain the good life and a moral order.<br><br>In our day we see many challenges to religious liberty and to conscience. There have also been many attempts to intervene in the private affairs of churches and Christian organisations. Though the public are concerned, party leaders seem unwilling to speak out. How important it is that we have politicians who speak out on these issues.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Four Ecumenical Councils and the Athanasian Creed">(June 2011) The Four Ecumenical Councils and the Athanasian Creed</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2011</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Councils of Nicea, Constantinople and Ephesus</b><br><br>June sees the anniversary of the conclusion of the first post-apostolic, world-wide, Council of Church leaders. It was convened in the winter of 324AD in Nicea (in modern Turkey) and dealt with a serious heresy.<br><br>The first great heresy in late New Testament times was that of the Gnostics who denied that Jesus Christ had come in human flesh (see John’s letters). Then came the Marcionites in the second century. These people denied the unity of the Old and New Testaments. But now in the fourth century there was a denial of the unity between God the Father and God the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. It began with Arius, a clergyman from Egypt. He and his followers were too literalistic in their interpretation of the Bible. They read Proverbs 8.22 which says of Wisdom, “the Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old.” Then they said, rightly, that this points to Jesus Christ as the divine “Wisdom” or ultimate “Word” of God. But their conclusion was that there was a time when he “was not”. They held that the text taught that Jesus was a <i>created </i>being; he might be the best created being but he was not truly equal to God the Father; and, as the Son, he was subordinate not only in ministry but <i>in essence</i>. <br><br>However, on the 15 June 325 at the Council of Nicea the majority of the Nicene Fathers were in line with the principle expressed in <i>Article XX </i>of the Church of England that we should not “so expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to another”. Thankfully, they sided not with Arius, but with his great opponent, Athanasius. They affirmed the truth now stated in the Creed, named after the Council of Nicea, that Jesus is “of one being with the Father”, or, as the old Book of Common Prayer translates it, “of one substance with the Father”. The original Greek word was <i>homo-ousion</i>, “of the same, or identical, being or essence or substance”. Others had wanted <i>homoi-ousion</i>. The additional “i” or iota, meant, “of like being” and so (as the philosophers put it) denied any “numerical” identity (i.e your car is that <i>same </i>one you were driving yesterday); the iota only affirms “qualitative” identity (i.e. your car is the <i>same </i>as mine). Thomas Carlyle was, surely, right to comment that one iota marked the difference between paganism and Christianity.<br><br>The work of the Council of Nicea was completed at the Second Ecumenical Council that met in Constantinople in 381 when the Church leaders clearly affirmed the full deity of the Holy Spirit. The next Ecumenical Council, the Third, met in Ephesus in 431. Of great importance there was the affirmation of Mary, the mother of Jesus, as “mother of God” or <i>Theotokos </i>(the Greek word for “bearer of God”). This phrase can be much mis-understood, hence the reluctance of some to use it. However, it expresses a vital truth. It rules out the teaching of yet another errant clergyman, Nestorius, and the idea that Mary simply gave birth to a “human” baby. It affirms that Mary while giving birth to a truly human baby was also giving birth to one who was <i>God</i>, the Son. People, of course, cannot take the phrase “<i>mother </i>of God” and then wrongly think of Mary as the life-giver to almighty God himself!<br><br><b>The Council of Chalcedon and the Athanasian Creed</b><br><br>The Council of Ephesus was dealing with the issue of Christ’s nature as both human and divine. The Church’s common mind on that, to be in conformity with the Bible and the Holy Spirit’s guiding, was defined in 451 at the Fourth Ecumenical Council meeting in Chalcedon. The Church was then fighting not only Nestorianism, which emphasized the full deity of Christ as God’s revelation and Jesus’ full humanity, but at the cost of Jesus Christ becoming almost two persons – a divine Christ and a human Jesus (a heresy that attracts liberal theologians in the modern period). This was in contrast to the error of Apollinarianism and the followers of Apollinarius (a heresy sometimes attractive to conservative Christians). Here the problem of how Jesus Christ could be both fully God and fully man was resolved by denying that Jesus had a human “soul”. That non physical side of our lives (variously described as the soul, spirit or mind) was replaced in Jesus, it was being taught, by the divine “Word”. So Apollinarians emphasized the unity of Christ’s person but at the sacrifice of his human nature. Jesus Christ, as it were, had a divine centre that controlled a physical body. The Word become <i>flesh </i>but not <i>human</i>. Another person who sacrificed Christ’s human nature in the interests of Christ’s unity of person and deity was Eutyches whose teaching suggested that Jesus’ humanity had been swallowed up by his divinity. <br><br>Against all of these ideas and teachings the Council of Chalcedon in 451 affirmed that Jesus is one person in two natures. But the Council of Chalcedon produced the great consensus of believers not only on the person and natures of Jesus Christ but also on the divine Trinity. And it gave rise to the Athanasian Creed that expresses this consensus, the most theological of the three fundamental creeds (the Apostles and Nicene being the other two).<br><br>However, the Athanasian Creed’s doctrines are statements that <i>follow </i>the facts and the mystery of God <i>rather than try to explain them </i>(so we have to hold in tension facts that are beyond our finite understanding). This Creed forms a boundary or fence around the truth. Its teaching is important for what is being ruled out. For example, the Creed rules out <i>tritheism </i>(that there are three gods), <i>unitarianism </i>(that there is one God who is not three and Christ not divine) and <i>modalism </i>(that the one God is simply plays three roles), as well as well as the heresies already outlined of Nestorius, Apollinarius and Eutyches.<br><br><b>The text of the Athanasian Creed</b><br><br>What then does the Athanasian creed say? Here is a modern translation by C.H. Turner and it is based on the revised Latin text:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Whoever desires to be saved must above all things hold the Catholic (or Universal) faith. Unless a man keeps it in its entirety inviolate, he will assuredly perish eternally (see the ‘Conclusion’ below). Now this is the Catholic faith, that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in unity, without confusing the persons or dividing the substance. For the Father's person is one, the Son's another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit is one, their glory is equal, their majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, such also the Holy Spirit. The Father is increate [uncreated], the Son increate, the Holy Spirit increate. The Father is infinite [Latin, ‘inmensus’], the Son infinite, the Holy Spirit infinite. The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal. Yet there are not there eternals, but one eternal; just as there are not three increates or three infinites, but one increate and one infinite. In the same way the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, the Holy Spirit almighty; yet there are not three almighties, but one almighty.Thus the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Spirit God; and yet there are not three Gods, but there is one God. Thus the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet there are not three Lords, but there is one Lord. Because just as we are obliged by Christian truth to acknowledge each person separately both God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the Catholic religion to speak of three Gods or Lords. The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created but begotten. The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this trinity there is nothing before or after, nothing greater or less, but all three persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. Thus in all things, as has been stated above both Trinity in unity and unity in Trinity must be worshipped. So he who desires to be saved should think thus of the Trinity.It is necessary, however, to eternal salvation that he should also faithfully believe in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is equally both God and man. He is God from the Father's substance, begotten before time; and he is man from his mother's substance, born in time. Perfect God, perfect man composed of a rational soul and human flesh, equal to the Father in respect of his divinity, less than the Father in respect of his humanity. Who although he is God and man, is nevertheless not two but one Christ. He is one, however, not by the transformation of his divinity into flesh, but by the taking up of his humanity into God; one certainly not by confusion of substance, but by oneness of person. For just as rational soul and flesh are a single man, so God and man are a single Christ. Who suffered for our salvation, descended to hell, rose from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the Father's right hand, whence he will come to judge living and dead: at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies, and will render an account of their deeds; and those who have behaved well will go to eternal life, those who have behaved badly to eternal fire. This is the Catholic faith. Unless a man believes it faithfully and steadfastly, he will not be able to be saved.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>With regard to the first paragraph (and in the old BCP translation of the Latin it reads, “Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly”), C.S.Lewis helpfully said the following: “The operative word is <i>keep</i>; not <i>acquire</i>, or even <i>believe </i>but <i>keep</i>. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters ... who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion, ... to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought.”<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Anders Breivik, Evil and Democracy">(August 2011) Anders Breivik, Evil and Democracy</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2011</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>murder</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Anders Breivik</b><br><br>How are we to understand what has been going on in July 2011. It has been a month that has shown up the moral bankruptcy of the 21st century. At the end of the month there was a manifestation of terrible evil. Some would challenge that description regarding the Norwegian, Anders Breivik (wrongly described as a “Christian fundamentalist”) who on 22 July killed 8 people through a huge truck bomb in the centre of Oslo. He then gunned down 69 (mostly young) people who were attending a political youth camp on Utoya Island. Breivik had been described as ‘insane’ by his own lawyer. But Norway’s domestic intelligence chief, Janne Kristiansen, told the BBC she believes he is “calculating, evil and sought the limelight.” So this mass killer is undergoing psychiatric tests at a prison which was a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War. He is being kept in isolation on suicide watch.<br><br>The Bible is quite clear, there is such a thing as “evil” and “an evil one”. Indeed, as we live apart from God we are all “evil” (Luke 11.13). Change comes as the Holy Spirit works in our lives (Gal 5.19-25). We become evil as we are obsessed with evil thinking and doing. Paul writes in Romans1:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Furthermore, [after condemning homsexual acts] since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them” (verses 28-32).</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Derrick Bird, Hitler and evil</b><br><br>This same debate occurred last summer over Derrick Bird, who in June 2010 went on another wicked and terrible killing spree in Cumbria when he shot 12 people before killing himself. On that occasion <i>The Independent </i>newpaper ran a story on the killings by an “investigative psychologist” with the headline, “A simmering anger fuelled by low self esteem and paranoia”. At a different level the <i>News of the World </i>(then still being published) called Bird “Psycho-Cabbie”, implying he was not a normal person, but a “psycho” taxi driver suffering from a disease. As Ron Rosenbaum put it, this analysis allows you to think such people “have poor ‘impulse control’, and so it’s not something we have to fear from normal people like ourselves.” However, in his article “Rescuing Evil” (<i>First Things </i>October 2010), Ron Rosenabaum was not happy with these assumptions. He found more helpful some observations of the Oxford (and Northumbrian) historian, the late Hugh Trevor-Roper (alias, Lord Dacre of Glanton). <br><br>At the end of the Second World War as a member of MI6, Trevor-Roper had to go into Hitler’s bunker to reconstruct the details of Hitler’s death. This was partly to scotch rumours of the Nazi leader’s escape and survival. But, writes Rosenabaum, “In the process, Trevor-Roper learned an immense amount of previously unavailable information. This included the discovery of Hitler’s ‘final testament’, in which, shortly before he killed himself, he commanded the German people never to cease and desist from their war to exterminate the ‘eternal poisoners of humanity, the Jews’ – a job he’d left unfinished.” <br><br>Rosenbaum eventually managed to meet Trevor-Roper. When he asked him, “Did Hitler know he was doing wrong when he was committing his crimes?” “Absolutely not,” was the reply. “He was convinced of his own rectitude.” Rosenbaum reports that “all Trevor-Roper discovered confirmed him in his belief that Hitler was a true believer – a man who did not consider himself evil but a heroic doctor, a veritable Pasteur, a great benefactor to humanity purifying the human race of infection”.<br><br><b>Resistance</b><br><br>The frightening thing is that such hideous and evil false ideas can be tolerated and even internalized by reasonable people. But the Christian Gospel helps you to be immune to such corruption.<br><br>The sociologist David Martin says that people … </p>

<blockquote><div>“… need a good story, a moral landscape of admonition and promise, for people who have sustained a bad Fall, but nevertheless seek a better city; and en route that story should tell them who is their neighbour, how to find a way home after prodigal expenditure in a waste land, and how to recognize a pearl of great price when they see it.”</div></blockquote>

<p>That “good story” is only in the Bible and is, in fact, its account of reality and the true nature of existence. People then need to live by that story (much of which is an historical story) in a relationship of faith in the risen and reigning Jesus Christ. Such is a sure way of combating the evil of Hitler, the evil of the violent and terrible anti Islamicism of Breivik,<i>or</i> the evil of (often quietly fascist) multicultural irrationalism that seeks to mute critics of Islam or of any other religion or philosophy.<br><br>Victoria Barnett’s analysis of those Germans who resisted the Nazis and particularly the Holocaust, in the Second World War, and those who did not (whom  she calls “bystanders”) is instructive. The main difference between the two groups was that those seeking to help the Jews maintained a different <i>vision </i>of what Germany was and could be from that which the Nazis promoted. Those who stood by simply felt helpless to do anything other than comply. They saw the situation as irremediable. They could not imagine things otherwise than they were. Today, the biblical account and  vision of a saving God of love enables people to resist the terrible extremism of men like Breivik and Hitler, and also the subtle extremism of modern anti-Christian secularists<br><br><b>Democratic confusion</b><br><br>Open democracy has been a catch phrase on the lips of Western Presidents and Prime Ministers not only in condemning Breivik but also is supporting the, so-called, Arab Spring. Of course, every one wants greater freedom in Muslim countries, especially where conversions to Christianity carry a death penalty and women can be treated as chattels. But what is the truth? Is democracy always a good thing? <br><br>Yes, a good case can be made that in a Christian context, as Winston Churchill said, democracy “is the least unsatisfactory form of government known to man.” But what happens when democracy is exported to a Muslim context? Is it more likely to protect those converting to Christianity and bring reasonable freedoms to women? (I write as ex-President Mubarak of Egypt is having his first day in court after his arrest. He is being charged with corruption and ordering the killing of protesters - the latter a charge that carries the death penalty. He was deposed on 11 February, after 18 days of mass demonstrations, centred on Cairo's central Tahrir Square, in which some 850 people were killed).<br><br><b>Egypt</b><br><br>Sadly there is currently disillusionment in Egypt. On 30 July one 27 year old Egyptian woman, Fatma Fahmi, said she had hoped that the regime changes ushered in by the Arab Spring would mean change for women. But that optimism has gone. Women’s groups, it is said, are struggling in the face of many of the popular Islamic movements that are taking hold across the region: “How about we leave the Stone Age and start treating women a bit better?” she said (<i>The Times</i>, 30 July). But in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood is expected to win just under half of the seats in the People’s Assembly. Women’s groups are wondering what kind of legislation the party will pass, given that many of their key political members follow a strict interpretation of Islamic law. But why was all this not expected?<br><br>In Egypt with 90 percent Muslim, 9 percent Christian and with a majority rural population, democracy will surely mean that “true Islamic believers” will be elected to power. These are Muslims who have not been seduced by the acids of urban Western secularism. That is because many “conservative Muslims”, like those Muslims in the UK lobbying for sharia law, are wanting to vote in representatives who will promote, as <i>they </i>define them, strong marriages and strong families and certainly outlaw homosexual sex. They do not want the chaotic sexual free for all of the current West. But in a Muslim country, with a conservative Muslim government, this is likely to mean unacceptable draconian practices are tolerated, if not enforced. Nor at present does the future look good for the Christian community. In May, it was reported that 12 Christians were murdered when Copts were attacked by Salafi Muslims. Many good Muslims were horrified. But it did not speak well for the new regime.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>We all need to pray for Europe and the Arab world in their respective confusions; and peacefully work to spread the goodnews of Jesus Christ.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Conversion of England (400-700AD)">(September 2011) The Conversion of England (400-700AD)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2011</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Following the rioting and looting in August 2011 in English cities, the need for the re-conversion of England to Jesus Christ as “the way and the truth and the life” (Jn 14.6) seems obvious. Maybe there are lessons from the first conversion of England over the three hundred year period 400-700 AD.<br><br><b>The beginning</b><br><br>By the early 400s the Roman legions had left Britain to defend the Empire nearer home against barbarian invaders. This left the situation in Britain without Roman organization and so fluid politically and religiously. There was now, therefore, a new challenge for the few Christians that remained in the country. So who met the challenge? It was met by 5th century evangelistic monks. They were people God used for church growth in these Islands when invading Angles, Saxons and Jutes had driven Christians west and north to the Celtic regions of Wales and Scotland. <br><br>But this new period of evangelization started not in England but in Celtic Ireland with Patrick (390-461). A son of British Christians he was kidnapped as a teenager by Irish slave traders to work as a shepherd in Ireland where in God’s providence he was soundly converted. After managing to escape, he spent a period of monastic training on the Continent before going back to Ireland in 432. By this time a missionary bishop, he then travelled throughout the land, preaching, teaching and baptizing new converts, against great odds and often in great danger. However, before his death Ireland was significantly a Christian country. <br><br>Patrick was an amazing church planter and evangelist. He established many churches, schools and monasteries (or minster churches). He influenced Irish kings and argued for the abolition of slavery. He, indeed, was a man committed to “godly living, church growth and changing Ireland”. Here are his own words: “In the light, therefore, of our faith in the Trinity I must make this<br>choice: regardless of the danger, I must make known the gift of God and everlasting consolation. Without fear and frankly I must spread everywhere the name of God so that after my decease I may leave a bequest to my brethren and sons whom I have baptised in the Lord – so many thousands of people.”<br><br><b>Celtic Christianity</b><br><br>We need to note that Ireland was <i>not</i> part of the Roman empire. It, therefore, lacked Roman administration and its organizational mirror image in church administration. This allowed Patrick’s Celtic Christianity to develop independently. How different this development was is disputed. But without a Roman diocesan and parochial system abbots of monasteries had practical authority over bishops, Celtic monks (as a simple fact) shaved their heads differently to Roman monks (this becoming a symbol of difference - like surplices were at the Reformation for the Church of England) and there was a practical difference over the date for Easter. However, the crucial difference was that while Roman monasticism was a tradition more of withdrawal, the Celtic monastic tradition was to encourage church growth, church planting and missionary work in the wider world.<br><br>Indeed, a wider Celtic missionary movement was launched from Ireland in 563. That was when Columba, a Celtic monk, founded a monastery on Iona, an island off the west coast of Scotland. This became a centre for evangelising Scotland and northern England. So Scotland soon saw many believers as did many places in England where monasteries were planted which in turn were new evangelistic centres. Even continental mission-work proceeded from Iona when Columbanus, a young monk with 12 assistants, went to the Continent, where having founded many other monasteries, he ended up in Italy and in his seventies founded the monastery at Bobbio.<br><br><b>The Roman mission</b><br><br>But in 597, 34 years later, there was also a new Italian, or Roman, missionary movement to Britain. It began small with Pope Gregory (590-604) sending a team under Augustine (not to be confused with the great Augustine, Bishop of Hippo) to the south of England. He was to establish 12 dioceses with parishes and with provincial archbishoprics in London and York, following the pattern of government left by the Roman legions nearly two centuries earlier. The Pope’s desire was to organize and centralize the Christianity that was re-emerging. Augustine was not, however, the most robust of men. He wrote back before leaving Gaul saying his party were afraid! “They were appalled,” he said, “at the idea of going to a barbarous, fierce and pagan nation,” to which Gregory replied to the effect, “keep calm and carry on!”<br><br>In the event Augustine was able to use an old church in Canterbury and had a significant response with many converts. Bishoprics in London and Rochester were established, but in 616 a pagan East Saxon king succeeded a friendly Christian king and the Bishops of London and Rochester had to flee across the Channel. But Paulinus, part of Augustine’s original team and working with King Edwin of Northumbria (through his Christian wife Ethelburg), was able to go to York in 625. He, too, saw a significant number of conversions. He even baptised some Christians in a river in Northumberland (off the road to Kirknewton, near Wooler where there is now a roadside plaque to commerate the event). Sadly this work of Paulinus was also short lived. This followed Edwin’s death in 633 with Mercians gaining control of Northumbria and re-establishing paganism as the kingdom’s official religion. Paulinus had to flee south. So by the early 630s, 40 years after its start, the Italian mission to Kent appears to have been unsuccessful. But in God’s timing that was when there was to be a new Celtic mission to England. It came from Iona to Lindisfarne, the island off the coast, just south of Berwick on Tweed.<br><br>Only a year or two after Edwin’s death, a Christian Northumbrian King gained power, named Oswald. He immediately invited not someone from Paulinus’ Roman connection but from Celtic Iona to re-evangelize the north. After a short visit by someone less than competent, Aidan came and in 635 founded the important monastery on Lindisfarne. Lindisfarne then became the centre for Christianity in Britain. People went from Lindisfarne not only evangelising Northumbria but many other parts of England. This resulted in a great advance of the Christian faith. So the Celtic mission took over where the Roman mission had failed and converts stood firm. There were no more widespread lapses into paganism. Nor was Lindisfarne only an evangelistic centre; it also became a centre for education and scholarship with the world famous Lindisfarne Gospels being completed at the monastery in 700.<br><br><b>The Celtic mission</b><br><br>The strength of the Celtic mission was centred on large monasteries (or minster churches) under abbots and not bishops, with evangelistic teams going out from the monasteries which were not regularized into neater diocesan and parish structures. It seems the Pope, or those of the Roman connection in the south, were worried and so sought conformity with the presenting problems being the date for Easter and the tonsure of monks. <br>According to the historian Bede (672/673 – 735), a Northumbrian pro-Roman monk, matters came to a head at the Synod of Whitby in 664 (convened by King Oswy of Northumbria). At this Synod the Roman tradition won the day. But faith and politics were so closely entwined at this stage that the King no doubt had his own political interests. However, one issue must have been the fundamental difference between the Celtic versus Roman way of evangelism. As John Finney puts it: “The Roman pattern was to set up a skeleton organisation and then evangelise. The Celtic pattern was to gather the people and then set up an appropriate framework for them.”<br><br>According to Bede the clinching argument at the Synod was “is Columba … to take precedence before the most blessed Prince of the Apostles?” And Matthew 16.18 was quoted. This, in those days, was a knockdown argument. Indeed, King Oswy concluded: “Peter is the guardian of the gates of heaven, and I shall not contradict him … otherwise, when I come to the gates of heaven, he who holds the keys may not be willing to open them!”<br><br>Things then changed but only gradually. In the providence of God good came from both traditions with, undoubtedly, faults and deficiencies on both sides. But with society so unstable and people too often on the move as they were displaced through invasion or war, there was something to be said for the Celtic method and for the comment that the Celts looked after people while the Romans looked after geographical areas. Be that as it may, the fact is that after Whitby, the Roman diocesan and parish system was now on its way.<br><br><b>The parish system</b><br><br>Theodore (d.690), who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, is said to have been the main advocate for the parish system. However, establishing a parish system was a slow process and was hardly established by the time of the Norman Conquest. As a structure it is valuable in some situations (as currently in the South Sudan). In Britain it could work as long as there was “one” church for the whole land, compulsion could ensure allegiance, and modern urbanization had yet to occur. But it has gradually proved a liability following “no compulsion” (through the Act of Toleration 1689 when rights were given to Free Churchmen), Catholic emancipation in 1829, modern urbanization (soon after), and, especially when the Church of England became so divided doctrinally and declined numerically (after 1960). That is why in England many are now arguing the time has come to try again a Celtic model of church order and evangelism – the minster model.<br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The 'New Class", Deception and a Response">(October 2011) The "New Class", Deception and a Response</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2011</li><li>Society and Public Life</li><li>disciples</li><li>media</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Jesus made it clear that our duty is (Matthew 28.19-20) …<br><br></p>

<blockquote><div>“… to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.“</div></blockquote>

<p>And he concluded with that great promise in verse 20</p>

<blockquote><div>“And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.</div></blockquote>

<p>But a requirement for  making disciples (literally, “learners”) is not just to know the content and the basics of the Christian faith and the Christian world view. This embraces the Creation, the Fall, the Redemption through the Cross and Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the End (with his return). Knowing and teaching that, of course, is absolutely necessary. But <i>how</i> you teach has to take account of the context in which you teach. And the <i>context</i> for us is a Western world influenced by a modern secular “intelligentsia”, also defined as the “<i>new class</i>”. Let me explain.<br><br><b>The “New Class”</b><br><br>The sociology of knowledge is very important. It simply draws attention to a common sense observation, namely that your social environment profoundly conditions your beliefs, or rather your “background” beliefs – things you often “take for granted”. In all societies there are “plausibility” structures that mean people are conditioned to believe, almost automatically, that certain things are true or false and certain things are right or wrong. Today this social conditioning is effected not least by education and the media. It is then argued that those in the education establishment and the media have become, and then promote, a “new class”.<br><br>The concept of a “new class” goes back to the days of the communist Soviet empire and revisionists like Djilas (of old Yugoslavia). Djilas saw a controlling political class emerging in his Soviet world that was working for <i>an expansion</i> of political control. While being justified as a benefit for the working class, in reality it generated more tyranny and hardship; and as we now know, self-imploded in 1989. <br><br>The concept of the “new class” was then taken over for understanding of what was happening in capitalist societies as well. Here the thesis was that in all advanced capitalist societies the middle class has split. On the one hand there is the “old” middle class – producing goods and services and made up of business people and the older professions. On the other hand there is now a “new” middle class – producing “knowledge” (so called) through education and the media (especially the electronic media) as well as through the administration and delivery of social and therapeutic services. And the new class has vested interests in centralism. This is because centralized funding (through taxation and, most importantly for the BBC, through an enforced licence fee) is essential to its support and functioning. The result is its huge influence. For as a tax-supported “knowledge class” it directs and controls communal information. <br><br><b>Centralized power</b><br><br>Centralized power, however, is always dangerous unless there are many checks and balances. “Democracy” is supposed to provide this. But the larger the centre, as was found in the Soviet Union, the more difficult it is for any outside the centre, whether elected or not, to exercise control. The brilliant BBC TV comedy series, <i>Yes, Minister</i> and <i>Yes, Prime Minister</i> were a witness to this fact (insiders said the episodes were all so true to life). For the Christian, the sad reality is that the new class is in a linear succession from the secular humananistic Continental Enlightenment tradition (the French and German tradition), and not the British and American Enlightenment tradition (in which the Christian Evangelical tradition played a major part). Opinion polls reveal, for example, that journalists’ values are far less sympathetic to orthodox Christian faith and ethics than those of the rest of the population. The result, as Thomas Sowell, the philosopher, puts it, is that there is now an “optional reality in the Media and Academia”. He says, “many among the intelligentsia create their own reality – whether deliberately or not – by filtering out information contrary to their conception of how the world is or ought to be. Some have gone further. J.A.Schumpter said that the first thing a man will do for his ideals is lie. It is not necessary to lie, however, in order to deceive, when filtering will accomplish the same purpose. This can take the form of reporting selective and atypical samples, suppressing some facts altogether, or filtering out the inconvenient meanings or connotations of words.”<br><br><b>Deception</b><br><br>So what is the evidence for this? This has been happening in TV for years. Martin Carr, a famous documentary producer, confessed that the producer’s first step was to “arrive at a point of view”. Balance had to be maintained but maintained carefully; otherwise you upset the “emotional impact” of the programme. He explained how you might interview someone as an opponent to your position. But if his personality would charm the viewers, you have to go for someone else who would alienate. Referring to a specific programme, Carr reports, “One could only feel a particular way at the end of the film … the way I felt about it!” Then there is “the Pinsky Principle”, named after an American journalist, Walter Pinsky. He described his approach like this: “If my research and journalistic instincts tell me one thing, my political instincts another … I won’t fugde it, I won’t bend it, but I won’t write it.”<br><br>Carr and Pinsky were from the formative generation of modern TV and journalism in the 1970s. But it is still the same over controversial issues like stem cell research (where the BBC regularly says that there is Christian opposition to “stem cell” research, when it is only “<i>embryonic</i> stem cell” research that is consistently opposed). Then there are homosexual issues and issues surrounding drug use. Given the present Government’s proposals regarding homosexual marriage, this is significant. Bernard Goldberg in his recent book, “<i>Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News</i>” reports that “during the period studied, 6 percent of the people with AIDS shown on the evening news were gay men. But in real life 58 percent were gay men … [then] on TV 2 percent of the AIDS sufferers were IV drug users. In real life 23 percent were.” William McGowan, <i>Colouring the News: How Crusading for Diversity Has Corrupted American Journalism</i> discovered that there were more than 3000 media stories about a gay man in Wyoming who was beaten unconsious by thugs and left to die, but fewer than 50 media stories about a teenage boy who was captured and repeatedly raped for hours by two homosexual men, who likewise left him to die. McGowan’s search indicated that the second story was not mentioned at all in the <i>New York Times</i> which, on the last Saturday of September 2011 was described on the BBC as being, <i>along with the BBC</i>, the most significant source for news in the world! <br><br><b>Wicked deception</b><br><br>Perhaps the most wicked filtering ever was before the Second World War and the non-reporting of the Soviet Union’s governement-created famine in the Ukraine and the North Caucasus that killed millions of people in the 1930s. Malcolm Muggeridge called this “one of the most monstrous crimes in history.” Thomas Sowell who cites this says: “<i>New York Times</i> Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty wrote, ‘There is no famine or actual starvation, nor is there likely to be’. He received a Pulitzer Prize … for his reports, ‘marked by scholarship, profundity, impartiality, sound judgment and exceptional clarity.’ Meanwhile, British writer Malcolm Muggeridge reported from the Ukraine that peasants there were in fact starving: ‘I mean starving in its absolute sense; not undernourished as, for instance, most Oriental peasants … and some unemployed workers in Europe, but having had for weeks next to nothing to eat.’” <br><br>When in the last days of the Soviet Union archives were finally opened under Mikhail Gorbachev an estimate of six million or more having died in the famine was confirmed. But in Britian at the time Muggeridge was vilified by the left-wing establishment led by Beatrice and Sidney Webb and so was unable to get work as a writer.<br><br><b>The Christian response</b><br><br>Paul wrote: “though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ” (2 Cor 10.3-5). As Christians, therefore, we must be concerned for the truth, which is often being publicly denied. For the truth is essential to true freedom. “Jesus said, ‘If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free’” (John 8.31-32). So for the Christian the fight against any opposition, therefore, is never to be with violence but with ideas and with the truth. That involves exposing media and educational deceptions when we can. So we have to use our minds. Paul says: “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Rom 12.2).<br><br>But it essential that we understand that so many people today have been deceived in terms of anti-Christian ideas and morals. At the end of the day it is the Holy Spirit alone who will bring true conviction regarding “sin and righteousness and judgment” (John 16.8). So we must pray for him to be working to open closed minds. But then our witness to Jesus is needed. So Peter could say to his Jewish opponents: “We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him” (Acts 5.32).<br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Capitalism, The Protest at St. Paul's Catherdral">(December 2011) Capitalism, The Protest at St. Paul's Catherdral</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2011</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Capitalism</b><br><br>The “Occupy London” protest at St Paul’s Cathedral has raised many issues. The presenting problem is, of course, capitalism. <br><br>But what is “capitalism”? It is where you have a business with private (i.e. non governmental) ownership and a work-force who exchange their labour for wages. The owners (the corporation or joint-stock company) that provide the capital (and are responsible for the business) take no wages but control and share the profit from selling the goods produced or the services rendered.<br><br>However, the word “capitalism” carries symbolic freight. It now stands for all that is disliked about the business world in general. Especially in mind are bankers and bosses with their bonuses and other perks such as severance packages after their businesses have failed. So UK protests against capitalism often mean: </p>

<blockquote><div>  “We don’t like a lot of what is going on in the City of London, or the Government at Westminster, because many of us now are having to pay a lot more for student grants/ mortgage deposits/ petrol etc., and the poor need a better deal. So we want something done about it.”</div></blockquote>

<p>  But exactly what is the issue and what is to be done, apart from the Government spending more money, is seldom articulated.<br><br><b>Socialism</b><br><br>The alternative to capitalism is “socialism”. But socialism as previously experienced is seen as even more of a problem. It is seen as impractical economically for the modern world. 1989 and the defeat of the socialist and tyrannical Soviet Union, it is argued, made that clear. <br><br>Under socialism, as currently understood, the means of production are put into common ownership; and the Government acts as an administrative machine promoting equality and the elimination of systems of power (especially the “class” system). The Government also seeks to “distribute” wealth from the rich to the poor through taxation and to guarantee individual rights. However, such socialism is seen by genuine atheistic Marxism as merely a transitional economic programme before the final classless utopia where there is to be no private property. But too much Government control under any system ends up with great waste and too many inefficiencies to achieve even the most noble of ideals. And because so many other areas of life can be said to relate to the economy this control is likely to increase and become totalitarian.<br><br>However, with socialism’s demise millions around the world thought a new age would dawn. It did not and for a number of reasons. Now, it may be feared, some old-style Marxists may be seeing their chances in the current economic turmoil. As Anthony Daniels has said: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Why should the philosophy of a man who died a century ago, whose prophecies have been confounded, and whose followers have caused some of the greatest catastrophes in history, remain the single most important intellectual influence in the world today, more important by far than that of men of more profound insight? Marxism answers several needs. It has its arcana, which persuade believers that they have penetrated to secrets veiled from others who are possessed of false consciousness. It appeals to the strongest of all political passions, hatred, and justifies it. It provides a highly intellectualised rationalization of a discreditable but almost universal and ineradicable emotion, envy. It forever puts the blame elsewhere, making self-examination unnecessary and self-knowledge impossible. It explains everything. Finally, it persuades believers that they have a special destiny in the world. For disgruntled intellectuals, nothing could be more gratifying. The end of Marxism is definitely not nigh.” </div></blockquote>

<p>  <b>The fundamental issue</b><br><br>It is true that Marxism has been a “religion” for so many. But the main problem today is not a resurgence of Soviet-style Marxist socialism. Rather it is the adverse effect of the influence of Marxism, with its atheistic world view, on the Christian world-view in the West for much of the 20th century. There has been massive “cognitive contamination”. <br><br>Since the 1960s, among many politicians, educators and journalists the Marxist assumption is now axiomatic, that ultimately human existence is economic. All human problems, therefore, reduce themselves in the end to a lack of material resources. But this Marxist conviction is “false consciousness” if ever. But it is the fundamental issue in the current debate. For as Jesus said (echoing the Old Testament): </p>

<blockquote><div>“Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God” (Mat 4.4).</div></blockquote>

<p> A society needs far more than the satisfaction of material needs - the legitimate business of economics. In 1943, in the middle of the Second World War, the then young Peter Drucker, a great founding “guru” of business studies, wrote this in his <i>Future of Industrial Man: </i></p>

<blockquote><div>“Economic security as a political programme ignores the most important lessons of the last twenty-five years [the mid-war years] that economic satisfactions are only negatively effective in society and politics. The absence of economic satisfactions creates severe social and political dislocations. But their presence does not by itself constitute a functioning society.” </div></blockquote>

<p> <b>Morality</b><br><br>Certainly neither capitalism nor socialism explain everything. They are simply economic programmes (or tools) to achieve other ends. So those “other ends” need to be right. Also people engaged in these programmes need to be acting morally. Currently too many are not. The recent documentary film <i>Inside Job</i> reveals some of the corruption at the highest levels. Interestingly the film reveals that financial immorality and greed goes hand in hand (exactly as, in Ephesians 5.5, the Bible says happens) with sexual immorality (in this case, the regular provision of high class prostitutes).<br><br>Since the advent of New Labour in the UK all are now “capitalists” - but of which sort? It was Archbishop William Temple who said that two of the great moral ends of any social order are freedom and fellowship. It can reasonably be argued that the right-leaning capitalist majors on freedom, while the left-leaning on fellowship; the right seeks to restore the balance when the collective state ignores or frustrates personal opportunity and initiative; the left seeks to prevent personal economic freedom unfairly frustrating the collective good. Then again the right is concerned to fulfil the biblical mandate of “being fruitful and replenishing the earth”, for it is concerned with wealth creation. The left, however, is concerned to obey the biblical command to secure a fair deal for the poor and oppressed. All these concerns are vital. But when you have lost the Christian world-view that undergirds those ends of freedom, fellowship and basic morality, expect problems! These we have got. There is undoubtedly unbridled greed at the top and naked envy at the bottom.<br><br><b>Friendly critics</b><br><br>Especially at the time of the Reformation, through Calvin and then through the English Reformers, Christianity played an important part in the emergence of capitalism. But at the same time Christians have been among its most relentless critics. As Richard Neuhaus says: “In some ways, this is neither unusual nor objectionable. It may even be laudable. The Christian message directs human beings to strive toward great achievement, and the same Christian message insists that all such achievements kept under critical judgement.”<br><br>Brian Griffiths, now Lord Griffiths, of Goldman Sachs, in his book Morality and the Market Place sees the problems with both Capitalism and Socialism. “Capitalism suffers because of inadequate limits on the exercise of freedom” while Socialism “suffers from an inability to put adequate constraints on the urge to control.” But this “inability to resolve the basic tension between freedom and control” is the crisis of secular humanism; and that comes from the crisis of human nature called “sin” which needs the forgiveness of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit for changing lives. So Brian Griffiths sees the urgent need for evangelism:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Christianity starts with faith in Christ and it finishes with service in the world … Because of this I believe that evangelism has an indispensable part to play in the establishment of a more just economic order. Obedience to Christ demands change, the world becomes his world, the poor, the weak and the suffering are men, women and children created in his image; injustice is an affront to his creation; despair indifference and aimlessness are replaced by hope, responsibility and purpose; and above all selfishness is transformed by love.”</div></blockquote>

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Marcello Pera, Secularism and Clayton Academy">(January 2012) Marcello Pera, Secularism and Clayton Academy</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2012</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Marcello Pera</b></p>

<blockquote><div>“In the past, Europeans and Americans employed the same expressions without fear of being misunderstood. They began from the same philosophical premise, the doctrine according to which man possesses rights prior to, and independent of, his belonging to a political community, nation, or state. The European philosophers Locke and Kant expressed themselves in exactly the same way as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams [American Founders]: man came into the world ‘endowed’ with unalienable rights. Endowed by whom? No one had any doubts about this: man had been endowed by God. By what God? No one hesitated here either: by the Christian God, or more precisely by the Judeo-Christian God, for it was the Judeo-Christian God who created man in his image, and the Christian God who became man and endured suffering in the human condition. This baptismal act is the historical foundation of liberalism. Historical, I say, because the intellectual and political battle of liberalism against the old social hierarchies and despotisms – including the alliance of throne and altar – was fought and won by adopting a Christian political theology. Conceptual, I say, because this political theology, explicitly or implicitly, offers the best tools to justify the dignity of man and, as a consequence, the concept of human rights.”</div></blockquote>

<p>  I make no apology for starting with an extended book review of a work published in 2008 by a distinguished non-Christian, Marcello Pera, entitled, <i>Why we should call ourselves Christians. </i>He is a professor of the philosophy of science and a former president of the Italian Senate (2001-2006). He believes that “if we remove the Christian underpinnings from human rights, not only will liberal doctrine collapse, but Western civilization will fall along with it.” Nor would this be the first time this happened. It happened relatively recently, he argues, when much of Europe had actively turned from a Christian to a truly pagan and a materialist philosophy. At that time “great liberal thinkers recognized that Europe’s descent into hell had been precipitated or promoted by the rejection of religion and of Christian ethics.” He lists three liberal witnesses.<br><br>Karl Popper, at the outbreak of the Second World War, wrote: “our Western civilization owes its rationalism, its faith in the rational unity of man and in the open society, and especially its scientific outlook, to the ancient Socratic and Christian belief in the brotherhood of all men.” Then in the worst days of the war when Nazi forces “were on the verge of overwhelming our Western civilization, the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce wrote a powerful and influential essay in which he explained ‘why we cannot help calling ourselves Christians’.” And Friedrich von Hayek, after the war was won, said he was “convinced that unless this breach between true liberal and religious convictions can be healed there is no hope for a revival of liberal forces.” <br><br><b>Where is Europe today and how has it got there? </b><br><br>So what does Pera think of Europe now? Let me quote again: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Today, politically speaking, liberals have won for the most part. The West has liberal constitutions, liberal institutions, liberal economies, and liberal systems of education. But we are so far from “the end of history” that the same breach between liberalism and Christianity that shook our civilization a few generations ago is now presenting itself in a new form. Not in the violent forms of Nazism or communism, but in the form of liberal secularism. For the destinies of Europe and the West, this ideology is no less dangerous; it is rather more insidious. It does not wear the brutal face of violence, but the alluring smile of culture. With its words, liberal secularism preaches freedom, tolerance, and democracy, but with its deeds it attacks precisely that Christian religion which prevents freedom from deteriorating into licence, tolerance into indifference, democracy into anarchy.”</div></blockquote>

<p>  Writing, it seems, just before the economic collapse of 2008, Perra goes some way to illustrating the truth of Jesus’ words in Luke 16.8: “the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.” But <i>how</i> is it that Europe has become so secularised and is, at the same time, becoming so “illiberal” not least towards Christians and their faith on which its liberalism is based? One factor has been education. <br><br>“Secularism” was invented in the mid 19th century. In 1851 (ten years before the founding of Jesmond Parish Church) a freethinker, George Holyoake,<br>wanted a less alienating term than “infidel” or “atheist” to be used for those who disbelieved and opposed Christianity. The term that Holyoake chose was “secularist”, certainly a clever ploy and a very antiseptic word for a growing and aggressive movement in Europe as the 1870s discovered.<br><br>Significantly, in 1870 the State in Britain began to play its part in education with the Forster Education Act. For centuries education had been a Christian enterprise. Nor did the State want Christians to retreat. However, in the new legislation there was a clause, to satisfy Free Churchmen (the “Cowper-Temple clause”), that said: “No religious catechism or religious formulary which is distinctive of any particular denomination shall be taught in the school”. Yes, the Bible was expected to be read and there was an option for conscientious withdrawal. And, yes, “Mere Christianity” sounds good. But without any clear definition of belief a school ethos could never be a bulwark against the rampant and aggressive secularism that was now on the march. William Gladstone, the British Prime Minister, put the <i>annus horribilis</i> as 1872. In that year he said: “It is not only the Christian Church, or only the Holy Scripture, or only Christianity, which is attacked;” but “the ties” were being snapped “which, under the still venerable name of Religion, unite man with the unseen world, and lighten the struggles and the woes of life by the hope of a better land.”<br><br><b>Humanist Manifesto I and II</b><br><br>Then a new and even more aggressive secularism appeared in the 1930s; but now it called itself, with another clever ploy, “humanism”. The year 1933 saw the rise of Hitler: it also saw the publication of the <i>Humanist Manifesto. </i>This <i>Manifesto</i> explicitly identified humanism as religious. What it deplored was, “the identification of the word <i>religion</i> with doctrines and methods which have lost their significance and which are powerless to solve the problem of human living in the Twentieth Century.” Among the major theses of its own “religious humanism” were the following: </p>

<blockquote><div>“Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created …  Humanism asserts that the nature of the universe depicted by modern science makes unacceptable any supernatural or cosmic guarantees of human values … Religious humanism considers the complete realization of human personality to be the end of man's life and seeks its development and fulfilment in the here and now … In place of the old attitudes involved in worship and prayer the humanist finds his religious emotions expressed in a heightened sense of personal life and in a co-operative effort to promote social well-being … Man is at last becoming aware that he alone is responsible for the realization of the world of his dreams, that he has within himself the power for its achievement.” </div></blockquote>

<p> True, this <i>Humanist Manifesto</i> was generally ignored. The authors are now forgotten. But its influence came through the giant of the group and the principal author of the document, John Dewey (1859-1952), the philosopher and educational theorist. The manifesto certainly reflected his views. And through this document he was able to disseminate them in strategic places - for example, colleges of education. His views have shaped modern education to a profound degree, steering it away from its Christian roots and in a secularist direction. This has had disastrous consequences. Nor are these just many cases of anti-Christian discrimination. Following the plausible suggestions of R.S Peters, education is “initiation” into a heritage. It is an inheritance of “sentiments, beliefs, imaginings, understandings and activities”. Too often these now are not Christian but positively secularist.<br><br>Secularism now holds to the <i>Humanist Manifesto II.</i> It came out in 1973 and “came out” on sex: “In the area of sexuality, we believe that intolerant attitudes, often cultivated by orthodox religions and puritanical cultures, unduly repress sexual conduct … Short of harming others or compelling them to do likewise, individuals should be permitted to express their sexual proclivities and pursue their life-styles as they desire.” Current sex education in the spirit of <i>Manifesto II</i> undoubtedly is “harming others” through peer pressure that compels “them to do likewise”. The 1988 Education Reform Act’s clauses that require a daily act of worship to “be wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character;” and that local syllabi of religious education “shall reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian” have been incapable, with notable exceptions, of withstanding this secular tide or, to quote Gladstone, of “re-uniting man with the unseen world”. So what is the answer?<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>We need overtly Christian head-teachers and teachers in State Schools working for a new liberalism and trying to initiate children into a heritage of<i> Christian</i> sentiments, beliefs, imaginings, understandings and activities in a truly liberal way. We also need new Christian Free Schools that will find that easier and can challenge State Schools to follow their example.

                <p><b>The sixteenth century and after</b><br><br>In the 16th century <i>Martin Luther</i> said, “there is no work more worthy of pope or emperor than a thorough reform of the universities … I would advise no one to send his child where the Holy Scriptures are not supreme. Every institution that does not unceasingly pursue the study of God’s word becomes corrupt.” <br><br>In the 17th century the Puritan <i>John Milton, </i>the author of the hugely influential tractate <i>Of Education </i>(and so a Father of modern English education), said, “the reforming of education … be one of the greatest and noblest designs that can be brought on, and for the want thereof the nation perishes.” He then went on to explain his philosophy: “The end of learning is to repair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love him, to imitate him, to be like him, as we may the nearest by possessing our souls of true virtue, which being united to the heavenly grace of faith makes up the highest perfection.” But this was not just to prepare students for heaven. Like a good Christian humanist he married the Bible to the best of the Greek and Roman classical educational traditions. For he wanted: “a complete and generous education … which fits a man to perform justly, skilfully and magnanimously all the offices both private and public, of peace and war”. <br><br>In the 18th century <i>John Wesley </i>wrote approvingly in his <i>Journal </i>of the new Sunday school movement that followed the evangelical revival, with its schools teaching not only the Bible but other subjects as well: “I find these schools springing up wherever I go.”<br><br>In the 19th century <i>King George III </i>commended new Christian schools saying, “It is my wish that every poor child in my dominions shall be taught to read the Bible.” Also in the 19th century<i> Wilberforce</i> along with attacking slavery was promoting the cause of universal Christian education in Parliament. It was said, he set out to do “within the church and near the throne what Wesley had accomplished in the meeting room and amongst the multitude.” <br><br><b>The twentieth century</b><br><br>In the 20th century in Britain, as the Second World War was drawing to a close, the 1944 Education Act was truly “education for all”; but it maintained the partnership of “Christianity and State” which had existed since Henry VIII and Edward VI had founded their schools and that was renewed with an Education Act of 1870. So when Lord Selbourne introduced in the House of Lords the 1944 Bill defending its Christian ethos and with Hitler still undefeated, he said: “The real enemy is naked materialistic paganism which has reared its head in Europe to a height unknown for a 1,000 years which threatens Christianity today and with it our civilization, our homes and our people ... Anglo-Saxon democracy would perish without the Christian ethic and <i>unless we are brought up to be a God-fearing Christian nation, </i>all our vaunted progress in other directions will crumble into dust.”<br><br>But then came the 1960s. In the UK there was, amongst young people especially, a social and cultural revolution that led to a reversal of many Christian standards and values. New attitudes to crime, children, the family, sex and marriage, as well as to class, race and religion were generated. Some of these changes were neutral, some were welcome, but too many were most unwelcome. Those that have led to the erosion of the Christian faith and ethics have had quite disastrous effects. On the one hand, in terms of sexual morals and the breakdown of marriage, damaged children have been a result; and on the other hand, in terms of greed and corruption, the current financial emergencies are a result. Nevertheless, at the end of the 60s many schools were still standing firm on not conceding their Christian ethos. Newcastle schools were standing firm when I arrived in Jesmond in 1973. The previous year (1972) there was a new Newcastle Agreed Syllabus of Religious Education, the senior section of which was copied from the Northamptonshire Education Committee’s Syllabus. Of course, it included teaching about other religions. But it first listed its “Aims”. They were as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>1) To help the pupils towards an understanding of the Christian Faith in Jesus Christ as “the Way, the Truth and the Life” (John 14.6), and to provide a basis from which they may move toward the belief that “Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing they may have life through his name” (John 20.31). 2) To enable pupils to discover how the Christian Faith has been practised in the past, and how it is to be practised today by relating the individual’s life in the community etc. to Christ’s standards of life and work. 3) To enable pupils to appreciate the nature and mission of the Christian Church and its role in relation to the Kingdom of God. 4) To encourage an understanding of the Bible as the Word of God “bearing witness, from the beginning to the end, of the truth about God and man, and man’s destiny as God has made it known in history” (J.S.Whale). 5) To draw attention to the literary value of the versions of the Bible and its cultural influences.</div></blockquote>

<p>But, then, in the 80s things changed – radically. Suddenly schools had to face attempts to institutionalise new extremisms. First, there emerged the extremism of those aggressively promoting post-modern philosophies of relativism and unrestrained sexual individualism. Then there was a new Muslim extremism emerging that employed public violence. This followed the return in 1979 of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran. The result was a loss of Christian nerve. A number of people were passively (and irrationally) promoting multi-faithism, while the theologically liberal leadership of the Protestant churches, including the Church of England, seemed incapable of any response. That was when the (then) Bishop of Durham was denying the virginal conception of Jesus and doubting his empty tomb while others were noisily wanting the Church to validate homosexual relationships. <br><br><b>The Swann Report</b><br><br>The dam broke with a Government Report, the Swann Report of 1985. Produced by a committee set up to enquire “into the Education of Children from Ethnic Minority Groups”, it sounded innocent but was in fact dynamite. 700 pages long it was read by few, except those wanting quotes for their new “multi-faith” agendas. It concluded that there were three approaches to religion in schools: one, “the Confessional” or Dogmatic Approach whose aim is “intellectual and cultic indoctrination” (a quite unfair pejorative description); two, the Anti-dogmatic Approach which sees religion as part of the history syllabus; and, three, (the favourite of the committee) the “Phenomenological” or Undogmatic Approach, where the aim is “the promotion of understanding. It uses the tools of scholarship in order to enter into an emphatic (sic!) experience of the faith of individuals and groups. It does not seek to promote any one religious viewpoint but it recognizes that the study of religion must transcend the merely informative.” The committee wanted this third (and rather incoherent) approach adopted in our schools for the sake of “ethnic minorities” (the non-Christian percentage of whom were representing at most 5% of the population). Many schools complied. However, in the 1988 Education Reform Act the embryonic <i>Christian Institute, </i>working with Lady Cox and the (then) Bishop of London, helped get the current Christian clauses passed that insist on school collective worship that is to be “wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character” and that religious education is to “reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian, while taking account of the teachings and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain” (of course, there were freedoms for various opt outs). <br><br>This was “ambulance” action at best. But at least it allowed, and allows, strong head teachers to take a school in a Christian direction. If it is not so taken, it, of course, is not neutral. To treat all religions as the same apart from “experience” is to teach a positive belief. But to initiate impressionable children into such a belief that ignores truth values, is nothing less than intellectual child-abuse. For the child is brought up to think it wrong to ask questions regarding the truth or error of religious teaching. It does not matter what the teaching at home is. Because of the hours spent in the school environment and with other anti-Christian propositions regularly expressed, the child is going to find it hard not to assume these propositions are correct. Conviction, even when you know others are wrong, requires social support (cf the <i>Asch Conformity Experiment</i>). Has not the time come, then, for parents, led by Christian parents, to challenge the State educational monopoly that leads to what has been called, “captive children”? We should thank the State for assisting the Church in the middle of the 19th century and then, in partnership, through to the middle of the 20th century, for enabling education for all. But we should remind politicians that the State in the Western educational tradition was not seen as a mechanism for Governments unilaterally to mould children. That is totalitarian. The Biblical aspect of that Western tradition has seen parents as essential in the educational process. For it is not “children” alone who have to be considered, but “children in the family” as the family is essential for a child’s education. <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>These and other reasons surely mean we need a Clayton Academy to help pioneer a new phase of Christian Education, committed to excellence and accessible to all wanting it. So we thank the current Government for the possibility of Christian Free Schools and increasing parent choice.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Message for Lent from the Archbishop of Kenya with an introduction by David Holloway">(March 2012) A Message for Lent from the Archbishop of Kenya with an introduction by David Holloway</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2012</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Mburi Partnership</b><br><br>At the beginning of May 2012 we celebrate at Jesmond Parish Church our 25 years of partnership with St. Philip’s Church, Mburi, Kirinyaga, in rural Kenya. <br><br>This partnership was established in 1987 when David Gitari was the Bishop of Mount Kenya East. On my sabbatical in 1986 the Bishop invited me to a service and Harembi (a Kenyan style fund-raising) at Ngiriambu Parish Church, a church in that diocese. This was in aid of a new church plant at Mburi, a mile or two away. The plan was for the little wooden St. Philip’s Church to become a permanent stone or brick structure.<br><br>At that event, at which I was asked to preach - with no notice (but having a translator gives you time to think) I made contact with Mwendwa, a great Christian man, who together with his wife, Joyce, have become a wonderful leadership team at St. Philip’s. In September 1986 Mwendwa then invited us at JPC to join in a partnership with St Philip’s. Much has happened since then following an assessment and survey Joan Parker (chairman of our mission committee) and I made of the region, the locality and the church in 1987. <br><br>That resulted in the partnership being established the same year and soon JPC’s first initiative of helping the locality of Mburi provide itself with a well at the church. We had discovered that people were having to carry and use water from a local stream. Inevitably there were serious health hazards. Following the well, we have helped subsequently in other practical ways. The first major activity was to help develop a large stone and brick worship centre, with rooms for workshops and also a clinic and laboratory (named by the church “the Jesmond Clinic”). More recently we have been able to sponsor a new state Christian primary school in the area, for which we thank God. But much has changed since those early days. <br><br><b>Bishops and Archbishops</b><br><br>Not least many new churches have been planted requiring the old diocese of Mount Keyna East that went up to Marsabit and the northern border, to divide into a number of dioceses – including the new diocese of Marsabit in the “remote” area where Rob Martin, an original co-partner of ours at Mburi, is now bishop. Also the leadership of the church has seen many changes. David Gitari, whom we knew (and know) well, went on to become the Archbishop of Kenya. He has since retired to be succeeded by Archbishop Nzimbi who, himself, has recently retired, to be succeeded by Archbishop Eliud Wabukala. This new Archbishop of Kenya is now having an international role as the Chairman of the GAFCON “primates” (senior Archbishops in the world-wide Anglican communion). <br><br>These primates had attended (an orthodox) Global Anglican Futures Conference (GAFCON) in Jerusalem in 2008. The conference came to a momentous (and necessary) decision that in its view Anglicanism is defined doctrinally by a commitment to the canon (that we call Canon A5 in the Church of England) that says:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The doctrine of the Church … is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Anglicanism is not, therefore, fundamentally defined by a relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury, whether or not you believe in the biblical basis on which the Anglican church is founded. It is doctrinally based. For that reason many of the primates (representing the majority of Anglicans in the world) refused to attend the last <i>Lambeth</i> Conference of global Anglican bishops. The problem was the number of bishops (and bishops of the Province of the USA especially) who were flagrantly rejecting the decision of the previous Lambeth Conference in respect of biblical sexual ethics. They were ordaining partnered homosexual clergy and had consecrated one notorious partnered homosexual bishop. Of course, GAFCON primates realized that this issue of sexual morality was simply a symptom of a much wider rejection of biblical doctrine and ethics. However, they believed such a rejection to be incompatible with the Christian faith. So this is the body of which Archbishop Wabukala is chairman. The Archbishop is also the Patron of AID (Anglican International Development), two of the trustees of which are from JPC - Donald Curry (Lord Curry) and myself.<br><br>In the light of all this – our connection at JPC with Kenya and these new developments in the Anglican Communion - I thought it would be good for us all to read the Archbishop of Kenya’s Lent message. It is primarily for the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK). But it is relevant for Christians globally.<br><br><b>From Archbishop Eliud Wabukala of Kenya</b></p>

<blockquote><div>Greetings in the Name of our Lord Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith!The disciplines of Lent, which begin on Ash Wednesday, are not intended to be burdensome, but to open our lives more fully to the transforming power of the gospel. Our mission as the Anglican Church of Kenya is simple, yet powerful: it is ‘to equip God’s people to transform society with the gospel’. This is an holistic transformation much deeper and more lasting than any government or international agency can bring because it addresses our deepest need, that of a restored relationship with the God in whose image we are made and whose workmanship we are.The glorious truth of the gospel is that we are justified freely by God’s grace alone, but far from making us complacent about doing good, the abundant grace and full forgiveness we have through the blood of Christ should be a great spur to Christ-like living, to walking in those good works ‘which God prepared beforehand’.Imagine the transformation if our nation heeded this call. As we prepare for general elections which will test the cohesiveness of our civil society, Christians need to model what it means to live in peace, practicing tolerance and forgiveness, with a new sense of urgency. Moreover, the foundation of our civic life is the family so it is vital that the love of Christ deeply infuses family relationships and that the shameful violence being reported in the media, not only of husbands towards wives but now even of wives towards husbands, is replaced by the kindness and gentleness of Christ.Our Christian faith can also have an impact on the scourge of unemployment; although the immediate causes often lie with economic forces beyond our control, the Christian values of hard work, thrift, enterprise and honesty have the capacity to bring long term prosperity.These things are not easy. They call for the spiritual depth which comes from a real and growing awareness of Christ’s presence in our personal lives. Otherwise, the good works God calls us to do will simply feel like burdens and we will not sustain them under pressure. During this Lenten season, whatever particular disciplines we adopt, our first aim should be to draw near to God in prayer and through his Word, beseeching him to make in us new and contrite hearts, hearts that will desire the things of his heart.Without this joyful discipline, we will be vulnerable to taking short cuts that lead us away from the truth of the gospel. Some church leaders seem to think that the transformation of society will simply come through commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, and at home in Kenya, the Vision 2030 initiative and the new constitution. While it is obvious that such good things as feeding the hungry, fighting disease, improving education and national prosperity are to be desired by all, by themselves any human dream can become a substitute gospel which renders repentance and the cross of Christ irrelevant.Moreover, we need to be discerning about the values behind these visions. For instance the Millennium Development Goals have grown out of a secularised Western culture which is pushing Christianity to the margins and uses the language of human rights and equality to promote irresponsibility in social life and diminish personal responsibility.So this Lent, let us seek to experience a renewed walk with Christ in those good works that God has prepared. The good news of the gospel is that transformation begins with ordinary men, women and children, however sinful or insignificant we may feel. It is not a responsibility we can leave to governments and agencies, but a challenge to fulfil the purposes of Almighty God in our place for our time.May the Lord establish your hearts in every good work as you trust in Him. Amen. Eliud Wabukala</div></blockquote>

                <p><b>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights</b><br><br>Clause 1 of Article 16 of the UN Declaration says: “Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.” Clause 3 then elaborates on the family: “The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.” That last clause is significant. First, it distinguishes “society” from the “state” and so immediately rules out the legitimacy of any totalitarian states (the state must itself be limited as well as putting limits on society). Secondly, it says that the state has a duty (so has society) to “protect” (and, therefore, not be destructive of) the family, which clause 1 ties to heterosexual marriage. The state, therefore, has no right to interfere with the marriage family, change it or manipulate it for its own purposes. <br><br>This not only reflects Christian teaching but, also, universal teaching. The anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss, sums it up when he says the family everywhere is “based on a union, more or less durable, but socially approved, of two individuals of opposite sexes who establish a household and bear and raise children.” So this marriage based family is “a social institution with a <i>biological</i> foundation”. And that biology is based not on government whim, but on hard “nature”. In the whole UN declaration the only one application of the word “natural” is to the family, which, therefore, has a “natural” right to protection and not a mere legal right passed by Parliament and which can be rescinded. The family is “prior” to the state.<br><br><b>“The First Society”</b><br><br>The 17th century philosopher John Locke called marriage, “the First Society”. It is the first building block of society – so no marriage, no families, no society and no state. For Locke, among other things, marriage is made up of sexual intercourse that is procreative, mutual support, and care for the couple’s common offspring. He would have agreed with David Blankenhorn who said that what children most need are “mothers and fathers, not caregivers, not parent like adults, and not even ‘parents’, but a mother and father who together made the child, who love the child and who love each other.”<br><br>But such a marriage family is under threat by the Government’s proposal to redefine  marriage. As Douglas Farrow puts it: “in attacking ‘heterosexual monogamy’, same sex marriage does away with the very institution – the only institution we have – that exists precisely in order to support the natural family and to affirm its independence from the state. In doing so, it effectively makes every citizen a ward of the state, by turning his or her most fundamental human connections into legal constructs at the state’s gift and disposal.” That is totalitarian and raises serious legitimacy questions. Because the Government is creating a new form of marriage, it is destructive rather than protective of heterosexual marriage as required by the UN Declaration’s Article 16. <br><br><b>Theresa May, Lynne Featherstone and Andrew Sullivan</b><br><br>At the heart of the problem is a new understanding of the essential nature of marriage. In the “Ministerial Foreword” of the Government’s Equalities Office, <i>Equal civil marriage: a consultation,</i> Theresa May and Lynne Featherstone write: “We recognise that the personal commitment made by same-sex couples when they enter into a civil partnership is no different to the commitment made by opposite sex couples when they enter into a marriage.” This implies that “a personal commitment” is sufficient for defining the essentials of marriage. This could not be more wrong! But it goes back to the gay, same-sex marriage advocate, who was one of the first to define-down marriage to include homosexual couples, Andrew Sullivan. He wrote: “In the contemporary West <i>marriage has become a way in which the state recognises an emotional commitment by two people to each other for life. And within that definition, </i>there is no public way, if one believes in equal rights under the law, in which it should legally be denied homosexuals [italics mine].” But several things need to be said in contradiction. <br><br>First, the new proposals of the Government and of Andrew Sullivan that want to exclude procreative sex from the definition of marriage, is like defining Nissan simply as a commercial business but not making cars essential to Nissan. And to exclude procreative sex, as is being argued, because some couples are childless, is like excluding winning medals as essential to the Olympic Games, because some athletes go home medal-less.<br><br>Universally and fundamentally marriage is about socially approved sexual intercourse. That is why to “consummate” marriage is traditionally to have sexual intercourse (defined as penile-vaginal penetration). A failure of such consummation has been a ground for “nullity” – the denial that a marriage has taken place. So people do not assume that what is most distinctive of a newly-wed couple is that they are now “having an emotional commitment”, but that they are now “having sex” with one another and still for many, thank God, having it as a new experience. True, given the permissiveness of current Western morals and education, others have not reserved sex for marriage and with damaging consequences. It is therefore understandable why there are those among the secular Western-educated elite who define marriage without any idea of sex. But in the interests of a minority, then to impose this definition on the majority with its damaging consequences is very wrong.<br><br><b>The minority and the majority</b><br><br>The facts are as follows: according to the Office of National Statistics and the latest results from their Integrated Household Survey April 2010 – March 2011 (from over 420,000 individual respondents, the biggest pool of UK social data after the census),<i> only 1% of the surveyed population identified themselves as Gay or Lesbian. </i>That is a tiny fraction of the population of over 60 million. The same is true of the “steady rate of approximately 5,800 per year” civil-partnerships being conducted in England and Wales compared with marriages. The latest figures for England and Wales were 241,100 marriages in 2010.<br><br>This homosexual minority together with heterosexual amoral elites have bought into, what John Haldane, professor of philosophy at St Andrews University, calls the<i> argumentum ad consummationem. </i>It goes like this. <i>“Major premise: </i>sexual attraction and love are determinants of human happiness and should be consummated where sincerely felt. <i>Minor premise:</i> you cannot choose to whom you are sexually attracted, and you cannot choose with whom you fall in love. <i>Conclusion:</i> whether or not they are chosen, attraction and love should be consummated where sincerely felt.” And Haldane comments: “this simplistic syllogism (uncritical in its use of choice, love, sentiment, and sincerity) provides the rational foundation for a culture of often unrestrained, promiscuous, and unfaithful – yet indulgently sentimental – coupling. And it under-girds the push for same-sex marriage on both sides of the Atlantic.” He is so right, especially when marriage is seen simply in terms of individualistic adult fulfilment. But marriage is important for bringing children into the world in a secure environment with a mother and father from whom they came and whom they can love and be loved by. This is for the good of the wider society. <br><br><b>Institutions</b><br><br>Furthermore, we all need to remember that marriage is an institution. But an institution not only has a relatively stable pattern of rules and structures to meet social needs; it also takes on a life of its own and to some degree controls those active within it. So the great value of marriage as an institution is that it gives stabilising support to the married couple and also to the children of the marriage family. That is why we need to strengthen the institution of heterosexual, life-long monogamous marriage. Instead it is being threatened by our “divorce culture” and, now, by its being defined down to the level of essentially non-procreative homosexual emotional relationships. But we do not have social institutions to support purely private emotional attachments. <br><br>Social institutions have<i> a public and social good </i>and the public and social good of marriage is child-rearing. For this you need not just “party A” and “party B” (as a husband and wife are called in Massachusetts, the first US State to have gay-marriages). Rather, you need a “wife” and “mother” supported by a “husband” and “father” where responsible fatherhood has social support. For a man to become a parent by impregnating a woman is instinctive; but to help a wife and mother look after the children is not instinctive but needs a husband and father who has institutional encouragement. And staying together for life needs institutional encouragement. All of this is in the interests of the children. So marriage is not there for the couple (or government) to shape. Rather it shapes the couple and helps them bond, giving security to the children. <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The Bible is clear. Marriage is a “creation ordinance” and not just a matter for believers. It is for all. Marriage in a church is distinctive in that we overtly there call on God to witness our vows, we overtly promise to seek to live in our marriages as Christ intends, and we pray. The Bible is also clear that, one, marriage is a gift from God and not something we construct; two, it is the only rightful place for sexual intercourse (such exclusivity helps marital bonding and rules out all pre-marital, extra-marital and homosexual sex); and, three, the resulting family is essential for the nurture of children and for them to grow in the Christian faith. <br><br>So may the Government’s proposals be soundly defeated!<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Biblical Sexual Ethic">(May 2012) A Biblical Sexual Ethic</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2012</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>In the light of the debate on reducing marriage to include same-sex unions, what does the Bible actually teach about same sex relationships?<br><br><b>The Old Testament </b><br><br>Genesis, the first book in the Bible, presupposes that to be human is to share humanity with the opposite sex. This is part of God's original plan for the created order - the creation of the man and the woman. The Genesis narrative is opposed to a Greek myth of an original hominid that was cut in two subsequent to its creation. Such a myth produces a metaphysic that says what is fundamental is “being human”: sexual differences are simply a matter of anatomical “plumbing”. The Bible, on the contrary, says that what is fundamental is your “being a human male or a human female”. There is equality but fundamental difference; and true sexual fulfilment is in the complimentarity of the male and the female - equal but different. That is the message of Genesis 1-2. You then have Genesis 19 and the incidents relating to Sodom. At one stage it was argued that these are not about homosexual behaviour but inhospitality. That is now rejected by serious scholars. The verb “to know” in the account undoubtedly means “to have sex”.<br><br>Moving on to Leviticus you find prohibitions on homosexual genital acts (18:22 and 20:13) interestingly sandwiching the great command to “love your neighbour as yourself” (19:18). It is argued, however, that other things are also prohibited in Leviticus that we regularly allow. That is true. But the Church of England interprets the Old Testament following its Article VII. That says: “although the law given from God by Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral.” Article VII, therefore, implies that Christians have long found problems with the application of some of the Old Testament. Interpretation then has to be governed by Article XX. That says: “the Church hath … authority in controversies of faith: and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.” You must, therefore, go to the New Testament for guidelines to help you understand the Old. You then properly can go back to the Old Testament and interpret it in the light of Christ. What, then, do Jesus and the New Testament have to say?<br><br><b>Jesus’ teaching</b><br><br>Jesus himself did not teach a great deal about homosexual sex. He referred to Sodom in Matthew 11:23-24: “And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.” He is, therefore, condemning Capernaum’s indifference to himself and his teaching as worse than the violence and sexual sins of Sodom. That is important for all Christians to remember in this current debate. <br><br>Jesus also may have been saying something about homosexuality in Matthew 19:12 where he said: “some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven.” He is teaching that some people do not experience heterosexual marriage because of choice (for “the kingdom of heaven”), while others because of the fallenness of the world - either the fallenness of men (castration or social circumstances), or the fallenness of nature (birth). Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd Century certainly took the latter to refer to “some men, [who] from their birth, have a natural sense of repulsion from a woman.” Most probably Jesus did not teach much on homosexuality because the Jews of his day were strictly opposed to such practices. Judaism was unique among the religions of the Ancient Near East in prohibiting homosexual sex. By forcing the sexual genie, as someone has put it, “into the marital bottle” it had a profound effect on the heightening of male-female marital love and of eroticizing marriage. In some cultures wives were mere child producers: pleasure was obtained from men, mistresses or prostitutes. This prohibition against homosexual relations was part of the process that helped to elevate the status of women. <br><br>Jesus, of course, generally upheld the Old Testament laws on sexual behaviour (Matthew 5:27-30; Mark 7:21-23). He only spoke of sexuality in the context of lifelong heterosexual marriage (Matthew 19:4-9). Yes, Jesus stressed the need for love. But nowhere did he teach that a motive of love can justify anything. He never taught his disciples that because of “love” they could ignore the Old Testament moral law: “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them” (Matthew 5:17).<br><br><b>The New Testament generally</b><br><br>When we look at wider New Testament teaching we can see distinctions made between the Levitical commands. Some of these the New Testament sees as provisional until Christ. That was obviously true of the sacrificial systems and the details of the priesthood. But discerning what is merely cultural or temporary (and so non-binding) from what are fundamental matters of basic morality (and so permanently binding), can only be learnt from seeing what is actually taught in the New Testament. For example, in the Old Testament a “eunuch” was not fully accepted into the worshipping people of God. But in the New Testament the Ethiopian eunuch most certainly was (Acts 8:27-39). By contrast the New Testament makes it clear that practising homosexuals (and for that matter adulterers and fornicators) are still not welcome until they repent.<br><br>It used to be said that in New Testament times there was no understanding of a natural homosexual condition: we now know better. That is simply false. Aristotle as early as the fourth century BC certainly distinguished between congenital and conditioned homosexuality. In the<i> Nicomachean Ethics</i> he says that homosexual practice is “sometimes the result of congenital tendencies, sometimes of habit.” This means you cannot ignore Paul in Romans 1 and his teaching on homosexuality. So Paul has to be taken at face value when he says, in Romans 1:24, speaking of the judgment of God on sin: “Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.” Then referring to these and other sins, Paul concludes, verse 32: “although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practise them.” Of course, that is not the last word from Paul. <br><br>The last word is his message of forgiveness at the Cross where Christ died for our sins in our place. In the Church there will be sinners of all sorts including those forgiven of sexual sin. There certainly were at Corinth. In 1 Corinthians in a section on immorality, Paul says this: “Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders, nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And <i>that is what some of you were</i>. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (6:9-11). Paul is saying people can change; and there is evidence that people can and do change today. True, many also are not changed; and there are people, who have experienced the forgiveness of Christ and the power of the Spirit, yet continue to struggle with homosexual temptations. But if we cease to define people by their sexual attractions, they are <i>not</i> “homosexuals”: they are simply “Christians having to deal with inappropriate sexual feelings”. And that is something most Christians have to deal with from time to time. The key is not to be “enticed”. So your strategy must be based on James 1:14-15: “each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.” That is why it is important to say “No!” in the early stages. That is why it is very wrong for bishops and other clergy to suggest that homosexual activity (or any sexual intercourse outside marriage) is permitted. It makes it hard for a person who is trying to say “No!” Also the “gay agenda” is very wrong in suggesting a “gay identity”. People are not “homosexuals” - a class on their own. We must insist they are<i> just</i> “people” like everyone else.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Referring to a homosexual orientation, David Mills puts it like this: “an <i>orientation</i> is simply a recurring temptation whether your genes or your brain tissue or your toilet training or the devil or bad companions present it to you.” Of course, the devil works at our weakest points. For some that is sexual temptation. For others it is alcohol. For others it is an uncontrollable temper. For some it is over money. Did the rich young ruler have an<i> orientation </i>to prefer wealth? Surely it is better to say he was tempted to greed. And, of course, heterosexual single people seeking to be faithful to God’s standard of abstinence before and within marriage also often find life hard and may, indeed, be tempted sexually. Such people are too often ignored. <br><br>The point is this. We all have different dominant temptations. No one, therefore, can be “holier than thou”. The Bible says we must learn to “put to death whatever belongs to our earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these the wrath of God is coming” (Colossians 3:5). But then we are to “clothe ourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience” (Colossians 3:12).<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="60 Years of Faithful Constitutional Monarchy">(June 2012) 60 Years of Faithful Constitutional Monarchy</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2012</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>St Paul tells us that in the church there ought not only to be “requests, prayers [and] intercessions” for “kings”, but also “thanksgiving” (1 Tim 2.1). So how we should thank God for our Queen and Constitutional Monarchy that she so faithfully has embodied for 60 years. <br><br>We, therefore, must first thank God that our Constitutional Monarchy is democratic but not <i>merely democratic</i>. There is a current common assumption that “democracy” is good in itself. But critics from Aristotle to those worried by possible outcomes from the “Arab Spring” have recognised that simple democracy can mean 51 percent of people enslaving the other 49 percent!<br><br>Secondly, we must thank God that our Constitutional Monarchy is liberal but not <i>merely liberal</i>. Sadly, where “liberty” becomes the absolute value as with the 19th century philosopher, J. S. Mill, it causes an unshackling from wise authority, cultural norms, communal traditions and faith in God. This usually leads to a level of social disorder and a decline of traditional social supports like marriage, the family and the church. The resulting problems, however, still have to be resolved. This is attempted by an impersonal, bureaucratic, ever expanding and costly state. Also, because the “state” is the one social cohesion alone entitled to use force, it can become a terrifying tyranny.<br><br>Thirdly, we must thank God that our Constitutional Monarchy is certainly not a <i>secular</i> liberal democracy. “Liberty, democracy and <i>secularism</i>” have been watch-words for modern tunnel-visioned Western elites as well as for earlier revolutionaries and for younger dissidents in today’s Muslim world, like in Iran. But godless secularism is powerless to nurture reasonable liberty and altruistic democracy. For such to be nurtured you need a culture and assumptions that certainly flow from a Christian world view. Its doctrine of the Fall stressing human corruption encourages democracy which, through elections, limits or removes corrupt leaders. Its doctrine of human creation in the image of God with man having an inherent dignity encourages a liberty that recognises “God-given rights” (not merely rights “voted” by Parliaments). <br><br>This doctrine also encourages a sane understanding of equality and so recognises legal equality (all subject to the same laws), political equality (all able to vote and having basic freedoms), social equality (all equally entitled to essential material support), and equality of opportunity (with a truly open society). But it denies a general equality of outcomes as normally “a man reaps what he sows” (Gal 6.7).<br><br>So, fourthly, we thank God that the Queen and our Constitutional Monarchy undergirds not a secular liberal democracy but a <i>Christian</i> liberal democracy. Having Christian roots, it involves a mixed and institutionally balanced government with a democratically elected House of Commons, an appointed House of Lords and a Sovereign who reigns not by simple hereditary right but on the basis of legal agreements and binding conventions. These are spelt out in the Coronation Oath where the Sovereign swears to uphold <i>at one and the same time</i> the laws of God and the laws of Parliament. <br><br>Our constitution, therefore, recognises that there is no such thing as a “naked public square”. All nations have to have some publicly preferred vision of the good life. We are thankful, therefore, that our monarchy symbolises the fact that the good life at least requires a “Christian canopy” and the government to be under a higher authority, namely that of Almighty God. Also the Queen is the “Supreme Governor” (not “Head”) of the Church of England; and she had to swear to maintain “the Protestant Reformed Religion” (the Anglican moderate Calvinism of Canon A5) and “the settlement of the Church of England”. Such a defined Christian commitment is in contrast to a non-doctrinal “mere Christianity” that too often slides into modern Gnostic new-age multifaith confusion or irrational secularism that pleases few. <br><br>Of course, the Queen is queen of those of other faiths or none. But this Christian canopy with a God of love (proved by the Cross of Christ) and a God who will not enforce belief (proved by the reality of final judgment) allows for pluralism in a way other faiths and philosophies do not. It is not surprising that other faith leaders do not want to see the disestablishment of the Church of England. Nor is it surprising that a poll for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee by ComRes found that almost three-quarters of people in England think that the Queen and future monarchs should keep the titles of Supreme Governor of the Church of England and “Defender of<i> the</i> Faith”.<br><br><i> (This also appeared in the Diamond Jubilee edition of the Church of England Newspaper, 3rd June 2012)</i><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Education and the Much Needed Debate">(August 2012) Education and the Much Needed Debate</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2012</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The debate</b><br><br>“We urgently need a public debate about the purposes of education,” so says David Green, the director of the Think Tank<i> Civitas</i>, in his book <i>Individualists Who Co-operate</i>. His main concern is the role of the government in education. That is because, “the primary responsibility for education,” he says, “should lie with parents.” The government on behalf of the whole society is to “provide a reliable helping hand when necessary.” But, he argues, sadly the government is now going further than it should. A similar debate over who has primary responsibility for the education of children - parents or the State - has been going on in America. Richard Baer, in his paper <i>American Public Education and the Myth of Value Neutrality</i> writes: “Americans have traditionally assumed that this responsibility should be placed on parents. Public schools have been understood to function in loco parentis, but recent trends suggest that the State is expanding its power over children at an increasing rate.” <br><br>Of course it is not being argued that the freedom of parents is seen as absolute. On the one hand, children need to be protected from parental neglect or abuse. On the other hand, the State has a legitimate interest in making sure its citizens become economically competent to function in the modern world. It does not want them to become wards of the State and dependent on public welfare payments and provisions. It also wants them to be sufficiently knowledgeable to become effective citizens in modern society. But all these objectives can be met by the State corporately setting minimum standards for instruction in the basics that all can agree on (obviously including reading, writing, and mathematics – something that cannot be taken for granted at the moment) and setting other agreed reasonable standards for schools. Where that is achieved parental choice should trump any central State dogmas so that tax-payers money should follow parental choice, as with British Free Schools (assuming there is no wrong discrimination in agreeing to Free Schools) or as with the Swedish system of school vouchers.<br><br><b>The urgency of the debate in England</b><br><br>In England the debate is now a matter of some urgency. The debate is significantly more than the current presenting problem for Christians of marital and so sexual morals. But with the English and Scottish Governments proposing to redefine marriage, unavoidably discussion regarding parents and the State will touch on questions regarding what should be taught to the young about marriage, sex and the family. It was the 19th century John Stuart Mill (a man with a range of conflicting views but he was one inspirer of the 1960s permissiveness) who, in his <i>Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St Andrews</i>, 1867, said this: “It is a very imperfect education which trains the intelligence only, but not the will. No one can dispense with an education directed expressly to the moral as well as to the intellectual part of our being.” He went on to say that “we must keep in view the inevitable limitations of what schools and universities can do. It is beyond their power to educate morally … It is the home, the family, which give us the moral  … education we really receive; and this is completed … by society, and the opinions and feelings with which we are there surrounded.”<br><br>In England, the UK as a whole and the West generally things spiritually and morally came to a head for education (and much else) in 1989 with the end of the Cold War. A vacuum was then created regarding our common social vision. We had not realized how much we had been relying on the spiritual capital from centuries of the Christian faith. Until that point for many the defence of democratic capitalism against totalitarian socialism had provided a sufficient national purpose. Certainly a common foe created sufficient national unity; and where necessary, inherited Christian spiritual capital could still be drawn on. That happened the previous year with the 1988 Education Reform Act, which required (and still requires) in maintained schools a daily act of worship “wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character;” and religious education was (and still is) to “reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian whilst taking account of the teaching and practice of the other principle religions represented in Great Britain.” However, since 1989 in place of a Christianly informed public and educational philosophy we now have in England too frequently publicly endorsed secular humanism together with public denigration of overt Christian faith and morals.<br><br>Of course cracks in the democratic West had already been widened by the 1960s erosion of the public Christian consensus. Contributing to this erosion were the radical student movements in Europe and the US. Interestingly, the students involved were the product (in the UK) of the 1944 Education Act. This was when the government took full charge of education in a quite new way; but it seemed reasonable because it was to ensure education for all. <br><br>Previously from Anglo Saxon times and the great school at Jarrow, through the Middle Ages and the Reformation, to the beginnings of a universal school system in the 19th century, schools in our islands had been Church or voluntarily initiated and controlled. Some government help came in 1833 and there was significantly more State involvement in 1870. But in 1944 it was almost total with an Education Act that was the result of a remarkable level of agreement in the UK. For what was proposed was still <i>Christian </i>education. Indeed, many saw the 1944 Act as strengthening the historic Christian educational tradition. The then Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, was one of its “architects”. In his 1942 book <i>Christianity and the Social Order </i>he had already argued that to avoid the evils of Hitler and Nazism currently being experienced “we must take steps to secure that the corporate life of the school is Christian.” So what has gone wrong since those days?<br><br><b>The Crisis of Western Education</b><br><br><i>The Crisis of Western Education</i> is the title of a book by Christopher Dawson. It is now seen as something of a prophetic book. Originally published in 1961, it was republished as being still relevant in 1989 for the centenary of Dawson’s birth. In it he had argued that universal education, as it was evolving in the West, was itself a serious problem. In fact it was not only coinciding with the secularisation of modern culture; it was very largely responsible for it. Dawson genuinely feared a universal education that “involves the creation of an immense machinery of organization and control which must go on growing in power and influence until it covers the whole field of culture and embraces every form of educational institution from the nursery school to the university.” But in the UK there was supposed to be, as promised in 1944, a partnership between Church and State over education. However, this had turned out (even by 1961) to be an unequal partnership. “This is not merely due to the disproportion in wealth and power of a religious minority as compared with the modern State. Even more important is the all-pervading influence of the secular standards and values which affects the whole educational system and makes the idea of an integrated religious culture seem antiquated and absurd to the politicians and publicists and the technical experts who are the makers of public opinion.”<br><br>There will always be some secular standards and values advocated by “dissidents” opposed to a Christian consensus. If they can secure a place in the educational empire, they have huge influence disproportionately to their numbers. This is because of the new “immense machinery of organization and control”. John Dewey, a US humanist philosopher and educationalist, was one such “dissident” in the first half of the 20th century and with his influence lasting throughout the century. He basically followed the French atheistic Enlightenment tradition of a “general will” where everyone helps define a society’s values. So “democracy” becomes for Dewey a primary value but not as a form of government; it is rather more as a religion and spiritual community. Education is then subordinated to servicing this democracy rather than to communicating knowledge. Dawson high-lights Dewey because his educational influence has been world-wide. Many have absorbed his views through politically correct policies of whose origin they were unaware. For example, seeing universal education as a basic instrument for “democratically” creating a “common mind” or “general will” (whether it does or not) requires “inclusivity” without qualification as another supreme value in education.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Because Dewey’s secular humanism is “religious”, it is obviously not neutral. A lack of neutrality in schools, however, can mean intolerance towards Christian parents when they act on their God-given duty - a duty under the Anglican Book of Common Prayer - to ensure that their children are “brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and to the praise of his holy Name”. That duty, of course, is an echo of Ephesians 6.4 where Fathers are told, “do not exasperate your children, instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.” But fulfilling that duty is getting more and more difficult, when their children have to spend thousands of hours between the ages of four and eighteen in an increasingly humanistic, and sometimes contra-Christian, teaching environment. Over the same years, however, they only spend hundreds of hours in a church youth teaching environment. <br><br>All this is why there must be a new national debate on the relationship of education to parents, to the State and to the Churches and then some (peaceful) action.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Theology, C. S. Lewis and The Athanasian Creed">(September 2012) Theology, C. S. Lewis and The Athanasian Creed</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2012</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>The Athanasian Creed is the third of the historic orthodox creeds - the others being the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed (which we say at Holy Communion Services). The Athanasian Creed maps out the Bible’s teaching on the divine Trinity and the <i>person </i>of Jesus. It does not map out Jesus’ redemptive <i>work</i>. Perhaps this omission and its long length is why it is seldom said publicly in churches. But its truths are vital. I, therefore, like to write about it from time to time and provide a copy of the text for reading in private. In previous years I have often quoted C.S.Lewis to help over the Creed’s opening, which many find difficult. This year I want to quote him on background issues as well - and first with regard to theology itself. <br><br><b>The importance of theology</b><br><br>After giving a lecture during the Second World War, Lewis tells of an airman who got up and said he was not interested in theology. “I’ve no use for that. But I know there is a God. I’ve felt him alone in the desert at night - the tremendous mystery. Little dogmas and formulas [<i>such as the Athanasian Creed</i>] to anyone who’s met the real thing seem so pedantic and unreal.” <br><br>How did Lewis’ respond? In summary, he said this: “the man probably had a real experience of God in the desert; and when he turned from that experience to the Christian creeds, I think he<i> was </i>really turning from something real to something less real.” Lewis then provided a helpful analogy: “In the same way, if a man has once looked at the Atlantic from the beach, and then goes and looks at a map of the Atlantic, he also will be turning from something more real to something less real - turning from real waves to a bit of coloured paper. A map <i>is</i> only coloured paper. But it is based on what hundreds and thousands of people have found out by sailing the real Atlantic. In that way it has behind it masses of experience just as real as the one you could have from the beach. Only while yours would be a single isolated glimpse, the map fits all those different experiences together. And if you want to go anywhere, the map is absolutely necessary. Well, theology is like the map. Merely learning and thinking about Christian doctrines, if you stop there, is less real and less exciting than the sort of thing my friend got in the desert. Doctrines aren’t God: they’re only a kind of map. However, if you want to get any further, you must use the map. Vague religion – feeling God in nature - is so attractive. It’s all thrills like watching waves from the beach. You won’t get to New Foundland, however, by studying the Atlantic from the beach; and you won’t get eternal life by just feeling the presence of God in flowers or music. True, neither will you get anywhere by looking at maps without going to sea. But you won’t be very safe if you go to sea without a map.” All this is so relevant to the Athanasian Creed. It is a map of the truth following the bibilical facts. It does not seek to explain them; but it helps us avoid certain errors. And this Creed is especially important for helping us avoid Trinitarian heresies that deny the Trinity, namely the truth that God is one God in three Persons.<br><br><b>The importance of the Trinity</b><br><br>The three main Trinitarian heresies are: <i>tritheism</i> (the claim that there are three Gods), <i>Unitarianism</i> (the claim that there is one God who is not three and Jesus Christ is not divine), and <i>modalism </i>(the claim that the one God is like an actor playing three parts). Some reach these conclusions because for them the Athanasian orthodoxy is just inconceivable. But they fail to realise that what is inconceivable is not always unreasonable or false. It can be true but beyond our understanding. How could this be the case with the Trinity? C.S.Lewis, again using analogies of which he is a master, suggests the following.<br><br>He begins by saying that there are people today who say they believe in God but not a personal God. This is because they believe the “mysterious something” behind all things must be more than a person. C.S.Lewis responds by saying Christians agree. But these others who say God is <i>beyond</i> personality, so often end up with an impersonal “something” ; and this “something” ultimately absorbes all, including people, like drops of water slipping into the ocean and ceasing to exist. It is only Christians who have any idea of how human persons can be taken into the life of God and yet remain themselves – “in fact, be very much more themselves than they were before.” <br><br>Lewis then talks of three dimensions “left or right, backwards or forwards, up or down” (he insists, you have to think carefully about this but it may be of help to some). He explains that if you are using only one dimension, you can only draw a straight line. If you are using two, you can draw a figure - say a square (made up of four straight lines). But if you have three dimensions, you can then build a solid body, say a cube; and a cube is made up of six squares. He then says that “the Christian account of God, involves that sort of principle”(with God on an altogether different level to us). “The human level is like a simple and rather empty level. On the human level one person is one being, and any two persons are two separate beings – just as in two dimensions (say a flat sheet of paper) one square is one figure, and any two squares are two separate figures. On the Divine level you still find personalities; but there you find them combined in new ways which we, who don’t live on that level, can’t imagine. In God’s dimension, so to speak, you find a being who is three Persons while remining one Being, just as a cube is six squares while remaining one cube. Of course, we can’t fully conceive of a Being like that. Just as if we were so made that we perceived only two dimensions in space, we could never properly imagine a cube. But we can get some sort of faint notion of it.” <br><br><b>The text of the Athanasian Creed</b><br><br>What then does the Athanasian Creed say? Here is a modern version from <i>An English Prayer Book: </i></p>

<blockquote><div>“Whosoever wishes to be saved before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic (or Universal) faith, which faith, if anyone does not keep it whole and unharmed, without doubt he will perish everlastingly (see the ‘Comment’ below). Now, the Catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the Persons nor dividing the divine being. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit, but the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is all one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son and such is the Holy Spirit: the Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated; the Father infinite [Latin, ‘inmensus’], the Son infinite, and the Holy Spirit infinite; the Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal; and yet they are not three Eternals but one Eternal, just as they are not three Uncreateds, nor three Infinites, but one Uncreated and one Infinite. In the same way, the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty; and yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty. Thus the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three Gods but one God. Thus the Father is the Lord, the Son is the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the Lord; and yet not three Lords, but one Lord. Because, just as we are compelled by Christian truth to confess each Person singly to be both God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten; the Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created, but begotten; the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this Trinity there is no before or after, no greater or less, but all three Persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. So that in all things, as has already been said, the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, is to be worshipped. He therefore who wishes to be saved let him think thus of the Trinity.Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he should faithfully believe the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both God and man equally. He is God from the Being of the Father, begotten before the worlds, and he is man from the being of his mother, born in the world; perfect God and perfect man, having both man’s rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards his divinity and inferior to the Father as regards his humanity; who, although he is God and man, yet he is not two, but one Christ; one, however, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by the taking up of humanity into God; utterly one, not by confusion of human and divine being but by unity of Christ’s one Person. For just as the rational soul and flesh are one man, so God and man are one Christ; who suffered for our salvation, descended to the realm of the dead, rose again the third day from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the right hand of the Father, from where he will come to judge the living and the dead; at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies and will give an account for their own actions, and those who have done good will go into life everlasting and those who have done evil into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith which, if anyone does not believe faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Comment</b><br><br>On the Creed’s first sentence, C.S.Lewis makes the following observation: “The operative word is <i>keep</i>; not <i>acquire</i> … but <i>keep</i>. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters ... who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion, ... to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought.”<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Limits of Science and the Christian Faith">(October 2012) The Limits of Science and the Christian Faith</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2012</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Stephen Hawking</b><br><br>Stephen Hawking, the world famous physicist and cosmologist with motor neurone disease, not unreasonably was given pride of place at the opening ceremony of the recent 2012 Paralympics in London. Last year he was interviewed by The Guardian newspaper and asked the following question:</p>

<blockquote><div> “You had a health scare and spent time in hospital in 2009. What, if anything, do you fear about death?”</div></blockquote>

<p>Hawking’s answer was:</p>

<blockquote><div>“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first. I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Hawking has made a heroic effort to cope with disability. But sadly his current philosophy of life seems to be that of tragic nihilism with no hope. Such a philosophy needs challenging. Even Hawking seemed to want that from what he said in the Olympic Stadium:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Look up at the stars, and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Such was his advice to the countless millions watching that opening ceremony of the Paralympics on TV.The problem, I suggest, with Stephen Hawking is that he, like many others sharing his world view, has allowed his thinking about the material universe to colour his thinking about the whole life of human beings. But why should men and women (or their essential humanity) be reduced to their brains and then likened to machines (such as modern computers)? There is a danger in too easily assuming that such a comparison will necessarily be helpful. The achievements of science in the non-human worlds of machines (and stars) have led to the application of the same methods of analysis and procedure to human individuals and human society and with some success. But this can then generate, often unwittingly, two assumptions: first, that these methods will always be successful in regard to human life, and secondly, that there is an essential equality between human nature and non-human nature. But common sense says men and women are not like machines or stars. They are very different. Indeed, common sense says such an equation is wrong for there simply is a hierarchy in nature. Men are not stones and men make machines. Thinking and speaking they rule in the natural world.<br><br><b>The success and limits of science</b><br><br>The reason for this success in science is because “nature” (or the universe seen in terms of physical laws) has been easier to understand and control than human nature. It is easier to send men to the moon than to control the warring Muslim sects in Syria and Iraq or street gangs in many of the world’s modern cities. So modern science cannot solve all problems. We need to remember the story of the man in the street at night looking down at the pavement under a lamp-post. “What are you doing?” he was asked. “I’ve lost my front door key,” he replied. “Are you sure you’ve lost it under the lamp-post?” “No!” was the reply. “But this is the only place where I can see.” We must, therefore, be careful before we look for the key to human life exclusively under the lamp of the modern (physical) sciences with their particular procedures and methods of testing hypotheses. We need another lamp and another area and different procedures and other methods of testing hypotheses. The German physicist and philosopher C.F.von Weizäcker put it like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Science cannot select the order in which it wants to treat its subjects according to their importance for human life. The motion of the planets is not relevant to human happiness or salvation. But it turned out to be a comparatively simple problem for mathematical treatment, and thus through the efforts of Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton its theory became the keystone of modern science. Human nature is less simple.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The brain and the mind</b><br><br>Stephen Hawking likens the brain to a computer. But such a model gives no account of the brain in relation to the human “mind”. The mind is so very different to the brain. With chemical preservative you can bottle up a brain. You cannot do that with a mind. The mind has to do with thoughts, feelings, fears, wishes, hopes and beliefs. These cannot be touched, dissected or bottled. Some may not be worried by this. They have the conviction that if only we were to understand more about physical molecular biology a full account of both our thoughts and emotions could eventually be given. But the problem is that non-physical thoughts and emotions so often are the most obvious cause of physical actions and events. The mental certainly can cause the physical: it is not always the other way round.<br><br>But why have a mechanistic model like a computer with its simple “inputs” and “outputs” as an explanatory model for the human thinking? Why not take a human model such as a football club? There you have the physical side - the stadium, supporters, players, fixture lists and so on. But on the other hand you have the ethos of the club and the more slippery ideas and moods of the supporters, players and management. It is certainly true that if you affect the physical side of the club, you can affect the ethos. So at Newcastle United painting or putting up the words “Sports Direct Arena” instead of “St James’ Park”, will alienate supporters. But to think that you have explained the cause of this negative mood simply by referring to the physical actions, is self-evidently silly. You must also mention the first cause, the non-physical ideas of Mike Ashley, chairman of Newcastle United and owner of Sports Direct who ordered the change, together with the nostalgia of supporters.<br><br><b>Anthropology and intellectuals</b><br><br>Of course, men and women are neither machines nor clubs. They are human persons. And the Bible teaches that they are double natured – that is, at one and the same time they are body and soul (or brain and mind) equally. This is in contrast to those, like Hawking and many moderns, who give priority to the physical; and ancient Greeks like Plato, who gave priority to the mental and spiritual side of man. The Bible, however, appears to have an “equality in unity”. Genesis 2.7 says “the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground [the physical side] and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life [and rational and moral life, coming from God] and man became a living being.” The “living being” that is man is equally physical and mental/spiritual. Because of his “physicality” science can be very helpful as in modern medicine. But man is more than his chemistry.<br><br>Your antecedent doctrine of man (your anthropology) is important. It can affect theories about mind/brain issues and psychology. The psychiatrist J.A.C. Brown once commented:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Although all schools of psychology dealing with the total personality claim to be wholly scientific and to have based their theories solely on hard facts and the results of experiment or dispassionate observation, this is not in fact true, since they inevitably begin with a belief about man’s essential nature which forms the implicit frame of reference into which their facts and the results of their observations are fitted rather than the reverse, as they would have us believe.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This should make us cautious with regard to some academics, especially those who through the media and much publicity become known as “public intellectuals”. They are always people of intelligence but not necessarily of wisdom. The danger is that too often they are believed, when they should be contradicted. Also what was said some time ago of John Maynard Keynes, the famous economist, by his biographer and fellow economist, Roy Harrod, could be said of many other intellectuals: </p>

<blockquote><div>“He [Keynes] held forth on a great range of topics, on some of which he was thoroughly expert, but on others of which he may have derived his views from the few pages of a book at which he had happened to glance. The air of authority was the same in both cases.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This is relevant for when atheistic scientists, such as Hawking now seems, who is a brilliant scientist, talk about heaven and the afterlife or the explanation of all things. They are then no longer talking physics but metaphysics. At that point nihilistic humanism and scientific naturalism will fail. The Christian says that for such metaphysical issues and answers you need God’s wisdom as mediated through the unique history of the Israelites and their prophets and supremely in Jesus Christ and his apostles. This wisdom you discover in the Bible and this the Church should preach.<br><br><b>Personal conclusion</b><br><br>I happened to be a contemporary at college with Stephen Hawking. The last contact I had with him was, before his illness, in a rowing boat – one of the college VIIIs. He was coxing and so looking forward, I was stroking so next to him and looking backward. We were in the inter-college four day bump races where the aim each day was to bump the boat in front and not be bumped from behind. In this one race we were cruising along comfortably. He saw we were catching the boat ahead. However, he did not see (which I could see) that the boat behind was catching us up very fast. I told him to put the rate up (which the stroke can do) but he refused. Of course, we were bumped. What he saw he analysed correctly, namely us catching the boat in front. But he failed to see the other half of the picture and the most important reality, namely that we were being caught from behind. <br><br>Sadly this is a parable of what is happening to so many scientists who ignore the eternal God, who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit (one God in three persons) and the creator and preserver of this amazing universe. They are missing out on more than “half the picture” and the most important of all realities.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Angus Macleay's Summing Up Speech in the General Synod Debate on Women Bishops">(December 2012) Angus Macleay's Summing Up Speech in the General Synod Debate on Women Bishops</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2012</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>Some in the press and the electronic media have been vitriolic in their writing against those opposing women bishops for the Church of England. People at the 6.30 pm service on 18 November will have received a copy of a short article I wrote for the </i>Church of England Newspaper<i> giving some biblical reasons for opposing the vote (this is now attached to the sermon transcript for that evening on</i> “Contending for Truth – Sex and Marriage <i>found on our website</i> www.church.org.uk.<i>). Below is a transcript of Angus Macleay’s summing up speech at the General Synod in the debate on 20 November. Angus is vicar of St Nicholas’ Church, Sevenoaks, Kent (a large church in the Rochester Diocese). But he also has northern connections (formerly he was a vicar in the Carlisle Diocese and is also a JPC Patronage Trustee). We are looking forward to Angus and Sue (his wife) visiting us in January for our Foundation Sunday (13 January 2013).</i><br><br><b>ANGUS MACLEAY’S SPEECH, GENERAL SYNOD 20 NOV 2012</b><br><br>As I seek to sum up this important debate concerning the Women Bishops Measure from a conservative evangelical perspective, I wish to look in a number of different directions.<br><br><b>1) Looking at the revised Measure</b><br><br>The key issue relates to the use of the phrase “in a manner that respects.” We cannot interpret it without understanding the broader context. It is hard to hear an institution such as the Synod offer “respect” at the same time as it is preparing to renege on promises made to us 20 years ago supposedly “in perpetuity”. How can trust flourish when what you currently have is being removed and the proposal that it is to be replaced with is something much weaker? Further how do we understand the word “respect” in the context where female members of Reform are being publicly belittled and insulted in the media by people wishing to support this Measure? “Respect” is an honourable word but within a specifically legal context it is a word which is being asked to bear too great a weight. In legal documents trust is built through the use of clarity in language rather than vague imprecise generalities. “Respect” is a fine word but in this context and with this background it feels slightly hollow.<br><br><b>2) Looking at the future if the Measure were to be passed</b><br><br>There are a number of concerns if the Measure passes. We are told that our solution lies in the Code of Practice. However my previous experience in sitting on the Code of Practice drafting group is not encouraging. Unless there is to be a significant increase in representation of conservative evangelicals and traditional Catholics on the new Code of Practice group, it is likely to come to conclusions very similar to the draft illustrative Code that we have already seen and which does not provide us with sufficient provision.<br><br>Further if passed we will proceed to being a church which rejoices in greater inclusivity but, the irony, there will be no inclusivity for those with our biblical and theological convictions. The Bishop of Chelmsford promises that we could look forward to the provision of conservative evangelical bishops but such promises seem hollow when there have been no such appointments over the last 15 years. During that period, despite various promises as well as the Pilling Report, there has simply been no appointment of a conservative evangelical bishop - which underlines the point that there continues to be no genuine respect for our theological position. Words need to be backed up by actions but few have been evident.<br><br>Finally, as I look to the future my great concern is that if this Measure is passed we will follow the trajectory of the Episcopal Church in the USA, where over the last thirty years we have seen growing liberalism and the development of a different gospel. Many of us have received emails declaring that is would be “missional suicide” not to pass this Measure. However genuine “missional suicide”, using any indication you wish to use, is through embarking on the same trajectory as TEC.<br><br><b>3) Looking back to where we’ve come from</b><br><br>As we look at where we have come from, we are told that all sides have compromised. However as I look at the sort of provision that was proposed in the early Gloucester or Guildford Reports and compare it to the current proposed provisions, it appears that virtually everything which could have been of any assistance has been removed by a process of Synodical subtraction. Everything of any value to us has been systematically squeezed out. Yet my concern is even greater when I look at the original <i>Rochester Report</i>. It carefully set out the various different views about women’s ministry and on p179 it proposed a set of questions. However Synod has not wished to discuss the possible answers. The report has not been discussed in the Dioceses, the Revision Committee nor at any point during this or the last quinquennium. A few weeks ago the chairman of that report the Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali said:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The Rochester Report” aimed, as it was asked, to prepare the Church for a theological and ecclesiological debate on the question of women in the ministry and especially in the episcopate. It attempted, therefore, to set out all the arguments about the nature of women’s ministry in the Church and to critique each one from the point of view of the others. It became clear, however, that many were not interested in such a fundamental debate but wished to initiate a process for the appointment of women bishops in the church as soon as possible. This process takes for granted secular assumptions about justice and equality rather than asking what the Bible means by such terms.”</div></blockquote>

<p>There has not been the careful public consideration of the biblical material upon which to base our current decision.<br><br><b>4) Looking into the Bible</b><br><br>Along with other conservative evangelicals I rejoice in both male and female ministry and that is evident from the practice of my current parish where women are involved in all sorts of vital ministries. However the witness of the New Testament includes 1 Timothy 2:12 which asserts that the authoritative teaching role should be fulfilled by a man. Last year after a period of illness I was able to write a short commentary on 1 Timothy for preachers; and in preparation I was able to read all sorts of different interpretations of that verse. However the question that I kept on asking was: why does Paul earth this teaching in verse 13 in creation rather than any temporary situation? It appears that this teaching is part of God’s ordering of creation.<br><br>I also hold to the teaching found in the Bible about headship. Some bishops have indicated that they wish to look at other parts of the New Testament rather than 1 Corinthians 11 where headship is mentioned. However what we need to do is hold all the different scriptures together in tension, rather than dismissing “difficult” verses, in order to discover the richness of the pattern of ministry in the New Testament. I was even more concerned to hear a Bishop boldly state at a public fringe meeting in July “I don’t believe in headship”. Yet “the head of Christ is God” indicates that headship is part of the ordering of the Godhead within the Trinity. There is both full equality between the persons of the Trinity and also difference at the same time. The Father is not the Son. The Son is not the Father. There is order within the Persons of the Trinity. They are equal and different – these qualities are not mutually exclusive. This means that headship in itself cannot be an intrinsically bad thing.<br><br>Further, since male and female are created in the image of God the Trinity, it would not be surprising for headship to be evident in the relations between men and women both within the family and marriage (see Ephesians 5) and also in ministry within the church family. Full equality can exist alongside difference in roles.<br><br>Yet if we join the Bishop in saying “we don’t believe in headship”, we pull an important strand out of the fabric of our theology. If we reject headship we reject being equal and different and replace it with being equal and the same. If we reject headship it will lead to the redefinition of episcopal ministry so that women can be bishops. It will also lead to the redefinition of marriage opening it up to those who are equal and the same. Ultimately it will lead to a redefinition of how we view the Godhead so that we simply see each person of the Trinity as equal and the same with no difference in roles. This is a dangerous route to travel. Things unravel when we pull out “headship” from our Bibles.<br><br><b>5) Conclusion</b><br><br>At the beginning of the Synod we heard a report from the Bishop of Harare of victory. But today whichever way the forthcoming vote goes there is no victory. Instead we face a train crash. I have sought, as invited by the Archbishop, to give my conservative evangelical perspective on the Measure. Whilst wholly supportive of women’s ministry we hold to a biblical complementarian vision out of genuine conviction and, therefore, in good conscience we have to vote against it.<br><br>Having said that, if the Measure is not passed I know that Reform would be prepared to respond to the invitation of the Archbishop designate and make ourselves available to meet with WATCH and any other groups which would enable us to find a better way forward that provides us with appropriate and proper provision.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Biblical Identity of the Church of England">(January 2013) The Biblical Identity of the Church of England</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2013</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>Jesmond Parish Church was founded in January 1861 to be “a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth”. Our founders simply wanted us to be faithful to true and apostolic Anglicanism. With so many outside (and inside) the Church unaware of our Anglican biblical heritage and legal position, a reminder may be of some value. <br><br><b>The legal position</b><br><br>Canon A1 <i>Of the Church of England</i> says: “The Church of England, established according to the laws of this realm under the Queen’s Majesty, belongs to the true and apostolic Church of Christ.” But what do we mean by such truth and apostolicity? The answer is in Canon A5 <i>Of the doctrine of the Church of England. </i>This is the “Canon of Canons” according to the <i>Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974.</i> This Canon defines the doctrine of the Church of England at law. This 1974 Measure (equivalent to an Act of Parliament) was passed by the General Synod of the Church of England to allow revision and modernization of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. But the Measure insisted that any revision had to be in line with the doctrine of the Church of England<i> as spelt out by Canon A5</i>. So this measure and Canon is particularly important at the present time when there is so much doctrinal confusion and conflict in the Church of England. Section 5.1 of the Measure says this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“the doctrine of the Church of England shall be construed in accordance with the statement concerning that doctrine contained in the Canons of the Church of England, which statement is in the following terms [and here it quotes Canon A 5]: ‘The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.’” </div></blockquote>

<p>That <i>is</i> the doctrine of the Church of England. Any thing contrary to that whether preached by a clergyman or voted by a Synod is<i> not</i> the teaching of the Church of England. And that teaching says, the holy Scriptures are to be our foundation or “grounding” for all doctrine. But, it also says, you must not ignore the wisdom of the ages. So the early Church debates about the Trinity and the person of Christ are very important where that teaching is “agreeable to the said Scriptures.” But in some things the “ancient Fathers and Councils” could be in error, so they need to be checked. Canon A5 concludes by saying that “particular” importance for apostolic truth is the Reformation teaching which you find in the “The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.” And it is when you go to those documents you find the doctrine and teaching of the Church of England <i>so biblical. </i><br><b><br>Anglican theology<br></b><br>Of the Thirty-nine Articles, Article VI <i>Of the Sufficiency of the holy Scriptures for salvation</i> tells you that “Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.” Article VII <i>Of the Old Testament</i> tells you that “The Old Testament is not contrary to the New” and is still relevant. Article XVII <i>Of Predestination and Election </i>tells you that in difficult doctrinal matters you are to “receive God’s promises as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God”. So you are to be concerned for the “general” sense of the Bible and God’s “expressly declared” commands, not some obscure verses. <br><br>Article XIX <i>Of the Church</i> defines “The visible Church of Christ” as “a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly administered according to Christ’s ordinance.” Article XX <i>Of the Authority of the Church</i> says: “The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God’s Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another”. That last principle is so important for biblical interpretation. Article XXI <i>Of the Authority of General Councils</i> says: “General Councils … when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and the Word of God,) they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining to God”. So the General Synod may err! And Article XXXV <i>Of the Homilies </i> refers to Cranmer’s (and others’) Reformation homilies (or sermons) as containing “a godly and wholesome Doctrine”. The very first Homily is on Scripture.<br><b><br>Archbishop Cranmer’s 16th century Homily<br></b><br>This is how the Homily, “a fruitful Exhortation to the Reading and Knowledge of Holy Scripture”, begins:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Unto a Christian man, there can be nothing either more necessary or profitable, than the knowledge of Holy Scripture; forasmuch as in it is contained God’s true word, setting forth his glory, and also man’s duty. And there is no truth nor doctrine, necessary for our justification and everlasting salvation, but that is, or may be, drawn out of that fountain and well of truth.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Here are some other excerpts:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Let us diligently search for the well of life in the books of the New and Old Testament … For in Holy Scripture is fully contained what we ought to do and what to eschew, what to believe, what to love, and what to look for at God’s hand at length. In these books we shall find the Father from whom, the Son by whom, and the Holy Spirit in whom, all things have their being and keeping up; and these three Persons to be but one God, and one substance. In these books we may learn to know ourselves, how vile and miserable we be; and also to know God, how good he is of himself, and how he maketh us and all creatures partakers of his goodness …These books, therefore, ought to be much in our hands, in our eyes, in our ears, in our mouths, but  most of all in our hearts …And in reading of God’s word … he most profiteth … that is most inspired with the Holy Spirit; most in his heart and life altered and changed into that thing which he readeth; he that is daily less and less proud, less wrathful, less covetous, and less desirous of worldly and vain pleasures; he that daily, forsaking his old vicious life, increaseth in virtue more and more …What excuse shall we therefore make, at the last day, before Christ, that delight to read or hear men’s fantasies and inventions, more than his most holy Gospel; and will find no time to do that, which chiefly, above all things, we should do; and will rather read other things than that, for the which we ought rather to leave reading of all other things? And if you are afraid of falling into error by reading Holy Scripture, I shall shew you how you may read it without danger of error. Read it humbly, with a meek and lowly heart, to the intent you may glorify God, and not your self, with the knowledge of it: and read it not without daily praying to God, that he would direct your reading to good effect; and take upon you to expound it no further than you can plainly understand it: for as St Augustine saith, the knowledge of Holy Scripture is a great, large, and a high place: but the door is very low, so that the high and arrogant man cannot run in; but he must stoop low and humble himself that shall enter into it. Presumption and arrogancy is the mother of all error; and humility needeth fear no error. For humility will only search to know the truth; it will search, and bring together one place with another; and where it cannot find out the meaning, it will pray, it will ask others that know, and will not presumptuously and rashly define any thing which it knoweth not …Although many things in the Scripture be spoken in obscure mysteries, yet there is nothing spoken under dark mysteries in one place, but the self-same thing in other places is spoken more familiarly and plainly, to the capacity both of learned and unlearned. And those things, in the Scripture, that be plain to understand, and necessary for salvation, every man’s duty is to learn them, to print them in memory, and effectually to exercise them; and, as for the dark mysteries, to be contented to be ignorant of them, until such time as it shall please God to open those things unto him.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>2013 may be a critical year for Christians in the UK. We can expect the “true and apostolic Church of Christ” to be opposed or attacked by secular groups, members of the Government and, sadly, some in the “visible” Church. Jesus countered such opposition (from the devil in the wilderness) by the use of key Scriptures. Three times Jesus said “it is written” and quoted fundamental biblical principles (Matt 4.4,7and 10). <br><br>May his example and our Anglican tradition encourage us to do the same.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Church Growth and Looking to the Future">(February 2013) Church Growth and Looking to the Future</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2013</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>As at Jesmond Parish Church we look to the future, it is good to remind ourselves of two things: one, our founders’ purpose, and, two, our mission statement. Our purpose was “to be a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth.” Our mission is “Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain”. <br><br>In the January <i>Coloured Supplement </i>I wrote about the <i>Biblical Identity</i> required by our Anglican constitution which our foundation endorses. In my Anniversary Sermon (13 Jan 2013) I spoke about<i> Godly Living</i>. We now need to consider<i> Church Growth</i>. (I hope to write about<i> Changing Britain</i> in March).<br><br><b>Theology</b><br><br>Church Growth can be analysed sociologically, historically and theologically.<br>I shall start with theology and the basic fact that all genuine church growth is God’s growth and work. Nevertheless the mystery of Divine Sovereignty does not excuse Christian believers from initiative and action. <br><br>The Psalmist says: “Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labour in vain” (Ps127.1). The divine master builder does not expect the labourers to take a holiday! Rather, when God is building, they should work to his plan and with his guidance and wisdom. And part of that wisdom, according to J.I.Packer in his little book, <i>God In Our Midst – seeking and receiving on going revival</i>, is the removal of barriers, with one of the chief spiritual barriers being <i>complacency</i>. He writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The first step, perhaps, to the renewal of the Christian people is that leaders should begin to repent of their too-ready acceptance of too-low levels of attainment both in themselves and in those whom they lead, and should learn to pray from their hearts the simple sounding but totally demanding prayer in Edwin Orr's chorus: ‘send a revival - start the work in me.’The second step, perhaps, is for leaders to challenge their followers as to whether they are not too much like the Laodiceans of Revelation, and whether Jesus' searing words to these latter, ‘you are lukewarm … you say, “I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing,” but knowing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked … Be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock …’ - do not apply directly to themselves, here and now. The third step, perhaps, is for us all, leaders and led together, to become more serious, expectant, and honest with each other as we look to God in our use of the means of grace - sermon and sacrament, worship and witness, praise and prayer, meditation and petition - and as we seek to make our own the Psalmist’s plea: ‘Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!’ (Psalm 139.23-24). Then the fourth step, perhaps, will be to trust the Holy Spirit to lead us on from there.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Sociology</b><br><br>Church growth in history is also important, as well as its theology (for some lessons from church growth in the 7th and late 18th centuries, see my chapter <i>The Pastor and Church Growth</i> in <i>The Renewed Pastor</i>, writings in honour of Philip Hacking, ed. Melvin Tinker, 2012). However, I now want to focus on what we can learn from a more sociological analysis of church growth.<br><br>The sociology of church growth takes seriously the words of the Anglican Reformer, Richard Hooker when he said that the church is “both a <i>society</i> and a <i>society supernatural</i>l” (Laws 1.xv.2). As a society it shares a similar social nature and social possibilities as other organisations of a similar size. But as a “society supernatural” it is very different. <br><br>It is the same with individuals. Normal human functioning does not cease for a human person converted to Jesus Christ. Rather God’s Holy Spirit now enables you, as a human, to live more as God intended. Similarly, believers corporately do not suddenly find the laws of human association suddenly suspended. Yet they can never ignore the supernatural dimension of their “society”. This was well understood by the late Peter Drucker, the guru of management studies. He saw management studies relevant to churches (and schools and hospitals etc.); but they were not to make churches more business-like but more church-like (and schools more school-like and hospitals more hospital-like). That is where many go wrong in the churches (and outside).<br><br><b>Growth ceilings</b><br><br>With these cautions and caveats, let me share some findings of Church Growth studies that I believe to be relevant to JPC.<br><br>A range of factors (unless dealt with) are likely to hinder or prevent churches growing. One fundamental factor is that regularly there appear to be “ceilings” to growth. Analysts have discovered 10 such ceilings, at 25-40, at 85-100, at 135-165, at 175-240, at 300-450, at 500-700, at 1,200, at (and more relevant to the USA and other parts of the world) 1,800, at 2800 and at 4,500 – beyond that there are too few churches for meaningful study.<br><br>Jesmond obviously relates to that 1,200 figure. Regarding this situation, Lyle Schaller, the guru of <i>church</i> management studies, reports there are “a far smaller number of churches” in this category. But their growth “usually requires a radical redefinition of role, responsibilities, and relationships of the senior pastor, the staff, and the volunteer leaders.<i> That is both difficult and rare</i> (italics mine).” <br><br><b>Seven considerations on growing larger</b><br><br>Let me list seven other things to be kept in mind regarding growth.<br><br>1) Apart from the incentive of obedience to Christ’s command to “make disciples” here are just three of many positives about larger church growth (all are “on average”): as churches grow there is a better retention of the adult children of church members (older young people need peer-groups found in larger churches); growing churches provide more programmes to help different needs; and growing churches give more money to missions (with small churches giving 5%, middle sized 10% and large up to 25%).<br><br>2) The temptation for not growing is being “comfortable where we are”. A probable reason why 1,200 is the most difficult of all ceilings is “so much is good as it is. So why change?” For many, says Lyle Schaller, “the status quo has more appeal than growth” and “taking care of today’s members is a higher priority than reaching people beyond the fellowship.” The change required is too costly.<br><br>3) A change sometimes is needed from being “low commitment” to “high commitment”. This takes seriously the report of Jesus where we are told, “He has done all things well” (Mark 7.37). So high commitment includes a stress on quality in everything. It means wanting standards at church higher, not lower, than standards outside church - as honouring to Christ. <br><br>4) Growth is more by addition rather than subtraction – such as more services, more sites, more groups and more activities in response to the needs of people. These require more staff and more volunteers and greater productivity. Greater productivity often requires learning to change (for some too great a cost). <br><br>5) Other costs include a faster pace of congregational life; an increase of complexity; more, and more accurate, internal communication; and perseverance and redundancy in inviting, in welcoming, in assimilating new members and in seeking volunteers.<br><br>6) Rising numbers will mean rising costs. It has been found that a church of 450 spends five or six times more than a church of 150, not three times more.  That is the price of increased quality in all things; a greater responsiveness to people’s needs; and, higher productivity all round.<br><br>7) Growth in larger churches encourages other faithful churches to grow.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>So I conclude with a repeat of what I said in the Anniversary Sermon on Hebrews 12.1 and “the race set before us” (at JPC). </p>

<blockquote><div>“I believe, under God, that over the next 5 years we can move to 2000 from the 1000 where we are now. And this particular race and course is set before us, not because we need it or would choose it, but because this city needs it and God, I believe, is guiding. But it will be costly and it will mean changes.”</div></blockquote>

<p>That is the challenge!<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Changing Britain (Part I)">(March 2013) Changing Britain (Part I)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2013</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Where are we going?</b><br><br>It is a sick society that is a conflicting set of factions. That is very nearly our present situation. But without a sense of common purpose, what else can there be? It is a myth to think that <i>any</i> of the present political parties will by themselves radically alter this state of affairs. The tragedy at present at Election times is this: the various political parties make promises concerning the future of Britain; but these are in effect promises to rearrange the furniture while the boat is still sinking. Neither the Conservative, the Liberal Democratic nor the Labour Parties can provide what is needed for Britain’s economic and social problems. Only the Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ has that.<br><br>Government will not solve all our national problems. For society is more than the sphere of government. Not only in society is there the sphere of politics and economics. There is, and must be, the sphere of the religious and the moral-cultural order. To expect, therefore, the Government to provide more than Caesar's share (the secular authority’s share) in public life is both unreasonable and dangerous. It is Christian people who have to present the claims of God to the nation. And God’s share is of supreme importance.<br><br>There is thus a desperate urgency for the Christian faith to be heard again in the Public Square. Yet it is vital that it is the <i>essentials</i> of the Christian faith that are heard in the Public Square. We do not need mere moralism. True, we must talk and work for social justice and personal morality, but that needs to be in the context of talking about the love of God in Jesus Christ. Moves such as altering society to reflect a better deal for urban (and rural) priority areas, on the one hand, or more decent moral standards for the good of family life, on the other hand, are vital, necessary, and a priority for the Church; but they will not bring lasting change. Jesus Christ said: “from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.” (Mk 7:21-23). Men and women themselves have to be changed and given new life. The gospel of God's grace in Jesus Christ and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit is what the nation needs. And that will only happen if Christian people talk about God in the Public Square and not just about political, economic and moral issues.<br><br>Sometime ago a little book was published, <i>What's wrong with Britain?</i> It was described as containing the "frank, forthright and thought-provoking views of fifteen of the world's most distinguished men". But there was nothing in the book about the spiritual state of the nation; there was no hint that the nation was under God or "the Orb set under the Cross" or that "the whole world is subject to the Power and Empire of Christ" (as the Queen was told at her Coronation). The nearest to it was from a traditionalist Peer. But his words were not ‘gospel’ (good-news). They were hopeful moralising:</p>

<blockquote><div>“The only way out of our present malaise is a more conscious effort on the part of all walks of life to inculcate and practise our traditional values of patriotism and service; regard for others in different walks of life and with values different from our own; respect for lawful authority and the rule of law on the part of the individual and organisations claiming to represent him; and an increased regard for individual liberty and responsibility on the part of central and local government authorities.”</div></blockquote>

<p>But the trouble with moralising is the ‘weakness of the will’. Paul sums it up: “I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.” (Rom 7:19). Paul's argument is that only in the power of the Holy Spirit of Christ can we <i>begin</i> to solve our problems. Moralising can make matters worse as people are <i>de</i>moralised, finding they cannot live up to the moral standards demanded. This is the case in the nation. We have had enough advice and analysis from sociologists, politicians, journalists and, yes, churchmen. We know there is a problem with Britain. What is needed now is a new vision of what God can enable the nation to be and the spiritual resources to move towards that vision. A national repentance is needed, such that God once again is acknowledged in public life. <br><br><b>Beginning at the Church</b><br><br>But repentance [literally, ‘<i>rethinking</i>’] has to begin with the Church. In the New Testament Peter says that judgement begins with the household of God. So individual Christians must be the first to repent. Surely this must include praying for the strength, courage and desire to witness to Christ outside the Church in whatever part of the ‘public realm’ we find ourselves.<br><br>Then, secondly, Christian congregations or local churches need to rethink and be praying for the Spirit of God to lead them to growth and greater effectiveness. In each local area the parish church or the chapel should be a public witness with ‘a high profile’ for the Gospel.<br><br>Thirdly, national Church structures similarly need rethinking and renewing. Sadly many of the central bureaucracies of the Church are over politicised and have lost their way, as have a number of our national Church leaders. <br><br>But things are changing. Already there are those who are praying and planning for growth. Currently, according to Peter Brierley, the church statistician, 40 percent of Church of England attendees now go to evangelical churches, up from 26 percent in 1989. Another unofficial statistic is that 70 percent of all male ordinands aged under 30 come from evangelical churches. This seems good for the future. While decline and weakness is too characteristic of parts of the Church of England, that is not the whole story. Furthermore, it is still a fact as a former Archbishop of York said: “religious bodies are the largest voluntary agencies in the country, and therefore on any reckoning make a massive contribution to the richness of institutional life, and to the social training and support of individuals.”<br><br>But how is the Church to witness to the nation itself? Is it meaningful to talk like that anyhow? Can Christian people help the nation as a whole be more aware of God and his claims? I think they can.<br><br><i>First</i>, they need to have a new ‘commitment’ to the nation and to all in their localities and regions. And the Church needs to promote a new ‘patriotism’ in Britain. Patriotism is out of fashion; but there can be no national purpose without it. It is out of fashion because of the loss, nationally, of a public acknowledgement of God. But the latest census shows that still 6 out of 10 people claim to be Christian. If a nation sees itself under the God who sees a legitimate place for Caesar, it need have no fear of patriotism sliding into totalitarian ‘nationalism’. Neither the Church nor the State can ever be absolute, when God alone is seen as absolute. But remove the God of the Bible and the spectre of secular or religious tyranny is never far away. If Christian people can rediscover a new national loyalty, they will then be able to challenge the nation from strength. In the words of the late Richard J Neuhaus, “loyalty to a community is the ticket that grants admission to the critical debate about the meaning of that community.” He makes the important point that “effective criticism ... depends upon rejoining protest to patriotism.”<br><br><i>Secondly</i>, the Church and Christian people need to help public debate focus on the spiritual dimension to many of our social and political questions. Such Christianly inspired public debate, under God, needs to be heard as an alternative to the imposed assertions of a media and educationally driven decadent materialism that currently shapes much of our public life. There needs to be a greater focus on fundamental beliefs about society, life and, indeed death. These are religious questions where we cannot avoid talking about God. So Christian people need to share and try to commend their own spiritual vision in this attempt to establish social goals. <br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br><i>Finally</i>, in sharing its vision and establishing these goals, the Church must remind itself, as well as the nation, of these words - they were first articulated centuries ago in the Old Testament:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Take care lest you forget the LORD your God … lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them … and your silver and gold is multiplied … then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God … Beware lest you say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth.’ You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers … And if you forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish” (Deut 8:11-14,17-19).</div></blockquote>

<p>But along with that warning there needs to go the Old Testament promise:<i> “if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land”</i> ( 2 Chron 7:14). <br><br>As the Psalmist says:<i> “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord” </i>(Ps 33:12).<br><br>[<i>This is an edited and updated version of a conclusion in my</i> A Nation Under God (Kingsway, 1987). <i>Part II to follow</i>.]<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Getting to 2000 in Five Years">(April 2013) Getting to 2000 in Five Years</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2013</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i>A shortened version of the Vicar’s Report at the JPC AGM 2013. Part II of “Changing Britain” is due for May 2013</i><br><br>At the recent January Anniversary Service I spoke on Hebrews 12.1-2:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith.”</div></blockquote>

<p>And I concluded with these words about “the race set before us” here at JPC: “I believe, under God, that over the next 5 years we can move to 2000 from the 1000 where we are now. And this particular race and course is set before us, not because we need it or would choose it, but because this city needs it and God, I believe, is guiding. But it will be costly and it will mean changes.”<br><br><b>Re-cap on Psalm 127</b><br><br>I explained some of the reasons for that conviction in the February Coloured Supplement on <i>Church Growth and Looking to the Future</i>. Let me highlight some of what I wrote then, but now adding more.<br><br>First, Psalm 127 makes it clear that all genuine church growth is God’s growth and work. Nevertheless the mystery of Divine Sovereignty does not excuse Christian believers from initiative and action. The Psalmist says: “Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labour in vain” (Ps127.1). <br><br>The divine master builder does not expect the labourers to take a holiday! Rather, when God is building, they should work to his plan and with his guidance and wisdom. On the basis of that, we all need to echo the words of a song we sing: “All I have and all I am is yours; there’s nothing that I have on earth that doesn’t come from you; I lay aside my pride and worldly worth: to serve you is the greatest thing that I could ever do; …</p>

<blockquote><div>… for unless you build this house,I am building it in vain.Unless the work is yours,There is nothing to be gained.I want something that will standWhen your holy fire comes;Something that will last,And to hear you say ‘well done’Giving glory to you Lord.”Nathan &amp; Lou Fellingham and Mike Busbee © 2005 Thankyou Music/The Livingstone Collective CCL 2054</div></blockquote>

<p>So what is needed to get growing to 2000?<br><br><b>Changing and not changing</b><br><br>We need to change and not to change. Let me explain. According to our foundation (which I have to ensure we keep to), we have “to maintain and promulgate sound scriptural and evangelical truth”. But “maintaining” requires effort not to change; “promulgating”, however, requires effort <i>to </i>change.<br><br>On the one hand we must never change our basic foundation which is Jesus Christ and God’s word; and maintaining biblical faithfulness is never easy. Sadly, with the degeneracy of our current society we may expect more of a drift within the church as well as outside; and there will be conflict – witness the proposals for Gay Marriage. So such not-changing will be hard. <br><br>But we also have to promulgate the faith and that is where we need change. For we have to be responsive to the changes in the culture. The problem here comes from a reluctance to face the costs of change. So I now want to mention four costs (and it needs to be said at the start, money is the least of the costs).<br><br><b>The first cost - not financial but spiritual</b><br><br>The<i> first</i> cost is quite simply one of <i>prayer, faith and obedience.</i> You may think that is too facile. It isn’t. For unless there is believing persistent prayer, there may be growth but valueless growth - the sort that doesn’t survive the holy fire when it comes (as the song puts it, with an allusion to 1 Corinthians 3). <br><br>There are so many biblical promises that not-praying is really inexcusable. For example, they are there in Luke 11.1-12. So keeping those verses in mind is helpful as you pray along the lines of the Lord’s Prayer and in the spirit of the Parable of the Friend at Midnight. That is praying, one, with a sense of desperate need, such as having “nothing to set before” a friend who arrives “at midnight”; and, two, persisting in prayer. Jesus’ promise then is…</p>

<blockquote><div>“and I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Believing prayer</b><br><br>But what is the evidence for the prayer Jesus is talking about and the requirement for it? Answer “faith”. If you move on to Luke 18.1-8 and the Parable of the Persistent Widow, a parable that people “ought always to pray and not lose heart” (and so a parable for today when so many faithful Christians are losing heart and growing spiritually weary), the conclusion of the parable is this: “nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find [<i>not prayer on earth but</i>] faith on earth.” <br><br>It is as though the opposite of prayer is not an absence of prayer but an absence of faith! <br><br>You may think that it is impossible to grow a church of 1000 to 2000 in five years. But that is why it <i>is</i> possible. Because, if it seems possible, it is hard to give God the glory. Because it seems impossible, genuine prayer can only be in faith if you are serious about things. That is to say, you will pray with a big vision of God and in the spirit of Ephesians 3.20, praying to one …</p>

<blockquote><div>“… who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Obedience the test of faith</b><br><br>And the test, or evidence, for the genuineness of such faith is obedience. At the end of John 3, that great chapter of belief and regeneration by faith, you read these words of Jesus (in verse 36):</p>

<blockquote><div>“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”</div></blockquote>

<p>The alternative to believing in a good and gracious Saviour, therefore, is not being unbelieving but being disobedient! The first cost, then, of getting to 2000 from 1000 in five years is persistent prayer, faith in a good and great God and simple obedience to him. <br><br>Who will, therefore, join me now in having a rule to pray, at least once a week, that by the end of 2018 we grow to 2000, and to pray keeping Ephesians 3.20 in mind and then praying for the strength of the Holy Spirit to do what Christ commands?<br><br><b>The second cost - overcoming complacency</b>This is a high cost when you are a church of 1000-1200. For that number generates the most difficult of ceilings to penetrate or plateaus to get off. But why? <br><br>The answer is because “so much is good as it is. So why change?” As church analysts tell us, for many “the status quo has more appeal than growth” and “taking care of today’s members is a higher priority than reaching people beyond the fellowship.” The change required of <i>overcoming</i> such <i>complacency</i> is too costly. It requires usually “a radical redefinition of role, responsibilities, and relationships of the senior pastor, the staff, and the volunteer leaders. That is both difficult and rare.”<br><br>It is obvious, of course why that is needed. We are talking of a church where there are 70 staff and not 35 and a budget of £2,000,000 and not £1,000,000. It is like building the staircase to the South Gallery years ago at JPC before we grew to need it. So we must begin to reshape for that new scenario now. As vicar I will need to be more a chairman with certain legal responsibilities, with a mentoring and advisory role and involved in more writing and wider affairs. Jonathan Pryke needs to be more the Senior Minister and treated like a new vicar who is in for the long-haul, with hands on leadership and with people aware of that. But the responsibilities and relationships of the other staff <i>and</i> volunteer leaders will also need to be reviewed. <br><br>And can I say two things: one, that a new system must be in place by this time next year and working. I am then due for a sabbatical; and, two, I am hoping that on this structural side most will be clear by the October 2013 leaders’ meeting? But with our current systems we must be praying and working for growth <i>as of now</i>! So there is the cost to overcoming the complacency of staying at 1000.<br><br><b>Authority in the larger church</b><br><br>A <i>third cost</i> we have already paid, but some people may still need to face up to it. This is the cost relating to authority in the larger church. I will read to you from the very last two pages of Lyle Schaller’s book <i>44 Steps Off the Plateau</i>. This will make things clear. Schaller (the doyen of church analysts) writes:</p>

<blockquote><div>“growth in numbers often is accompanied by a shift in authority patterns. The basic generalization is the smaller the size of the congregation, the more likely most of the authority will be vested in volunteers. By contrast, in large … churches, most of the real power rests with the senior pastor and the staff. … The central part of the explanation for this difference is not doctrine or polity. It is knowledge. In Western society knowledge is the chief source of power. In the tradition-bound and past-oriented small congregation, knowledge about the past and local traditions plus long tenure as a volunteer plus a role in the local grapevine as both a sender and a recipient of oral messages plus crucial friendship and kinship ties plus an investment of four or five or six hours of time a week can make one a powerful leader.In the large … church knowledge about contemporary reality, an understanding of the goals for the next few years, competence in gathering crucial data from printed sources, and the investment of fifty or sixty hours of time every week are the best sources of  knowledge … [and that is what the staff have].</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The second factor</b></p>

<blockquote><div>A second source of this conflict may lie in the distinction between authority and power. The polity of that religious tradition and/or the constitution of that parish may assign a large quantity of authority to the volunteer leaders. The size, complexity, and rapid growth of that parish, however, mean most of the knowledge about contemporary reality is in the heads of staff, even though their legitimate authority is severely limited. The natural and predictable result is frequent clashes between volunteer leaders, who declare they have great authority, and the staff, who derive their power from a huge investment of time, skill, and energy that makes them highly knowledgeable leaders. Sometimes this conflict is resolved by the stormy departure of a couple of volunteer leaders … More often, a compromise is worked out that immobilizes all decision makers, and a high degree of passivity is followed by a decline in numbers.The product of these generalizations is that implementation of a strategy to move up off a plateau in size usually is accompanied by a shift in power from volunteer leaders to paid staff. This is less of a problem in Roman Catholic, Methodist, Episcopal or Anglican traditions than in Reformed churches and Baptist churches and similar traditions that grant great authority to lay elders.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Quality, productivity and responsiveness</b><br><br>So as the church gets larger people have to face the reality of authority in the church changing. That is the reason why communication is so important, and quality in communication. Indeed, one of the costs of growing is communication. But to do that well takes time and time equals money because it cannot be done by volunteers who are only working 6 hours a week for the church and not 60 hours by staff who know what is going on.<br><br>That brings me to the <i>fourth cost</i> I want to mention – namely the need for quality (in everything), productivity (in work) and responsiveness (to needs).<br><br>Jesus we are told (Mark 7.37) “has done all things well”. We will need to follow that lead with a high commitment to <i>quality</i>. Growth is often more by addition than subtraction – such as more services, more sites, more groups and more activities in response to needs. But as more people are involved and committed to quality, we need more <i>productivity</i> out of the hours people have to spend on tasks – that is true for staff and volunteers. And, to repeat, the activities need to be <i>responses to needs</i>. There are so many of these with, of course, a major one, as we know, relating to education and schooling. Also we need strategies to help rebuild a (Christian) marriage and family culture, along with help for broken families (such as <i>Safe Families for Children</i>).<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>I must conclude. God’s grace (or giving) is free. But it needs to be believed in, prayed for and then to lead us, in grateful, humble and sensible response, to obey his word and his will. With such faithfulness, we should expect greater effectiveness in <i>Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain. </i><br><br>And as a post script: remember this and last year’s <i>Giving Review</i> themes: “Expect great things from God: attempt great things for God,” William Carey.<br><br><br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Changing Britain (Part II)">(May 2013) Changing Britain (Part II)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2013</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>If Christian people need to help public debate focus on the spiritual dimension to many of our current social and political problems, what should be done? It is sometimes easier to say “what should not be done”. <br><b><br>Lessons from William Temple<br></b><br>William Temple, who shaped much Christian political thinking in the 20th century and became Archbishop of Canterbury, once issued this warning: </p>

<blockquote><div>“the Church and the official representatives of the Church must keep themselves free from entanglements of party politics. Their business is something far more fundamental and important: it is the formation of that mind and temper in the whole community which will lead to wholesome legislation by any and all parties.” </div></blockquote>

<p>That, however, was when the state had a more limited public function than it has today and Temple wanted to keep it that way. So he affirmed three fundamentals about the State:</p>

<blockquote><div>“One, society is more than the State and has a life which is largely independent of the State; two, social progress largely consists of the expression and development of that independence; three, the State is distinguished from other ‘social cohesions’ by the fact that it alone is entitled to use force in order to secure obedience to its commands.” </div></blockquote>

<p>Temple, therefore, endorsed the view that the Public Square was not to be identified with Parliament Square!<br><br>He also knew that the greatest influence on the world by the Church was not in political or social Church pronouncements (or even fights with the Government), but in the faithful “daily round and common task” of individual believers in the world. “Nine-tenths of the work of the Church in the world,” he said, “is done by Christian people fulfilling responsibilities and performing tasks which in themselves are not part of the official system of the Church at all.” <br><br>He specifically referred to the work of Evangelicals in the 19th century. He cited Wilberforce and his friends who were involved in the abolition of the slave trade and then slavery itself. But he recognised that there are other more humble people who act as the “salt of the earth”. So he agreed “that the task of the Church in the face of social problems is to make good Christian men and women. That is by far its most important contribution.”<br><b><br>Practical engagement<br></b><br>Temple, however, argued that four factors should cause the Church through its leaders and Christians generally to engage in political affairs (in a non-party way). First, there are the claims of Christ-like love for those who suffer. Secondly, there is the fact that a social or economic system – whether socialist or capitalist – gives rise to certain consequences. Thirdly, there is the need for justice, as the Old Testament so clearly shows. Fourthly, there are the claims of the created order that God intended for man; and man’s creation is as a social being.<br><br>But how should the Church practically engage in politics? Temple reckoned there were three ways. One, its members should live positively for Jesus Christ in daily life (as has already been said); two, its members should vote responsibly every five years to promote Christian values (and, in addition, some should be directly involved in politics and government); but, three, the Church itself through its clergy and teachers needs to provide Christian men and women “with a systematic statement of principles to aid them in doing these two things, and this will carry with it a denunciation of customs or institutions in contemporary life and practice which offend against those principles” (and that was written in 1942 during the Second World War in the face of Nazism and Hitler).<br><br>Up to this point Temple carried with him all those who wanted to oppose some existing Government policies. He also carried the more “revolutionary” elements who wanted to change the whole social order. For he was saying that the Church needed to point out where the existing social and political order was in conflict with Christian principles.<br><br>But he lost support once he was heard to say that the Church was not to dictate means for solving political problems. For he believed that the role of the Church in social and political affairs was, like the Government, limited. It was limited, first, to teaching about <i>ends</i> and, secondly, to a criticism of means that did not achieve the prescribed ends or that were self-evidently evil. The Archbishop gave what has become a famous analogy to illustrate the point:</p>

<blockquote><div>“If a bridge is to be built, the Church may remind the engineer that it is his obligation to provide a really safe bridge; but it is not entitled to tell him whether, in fact, his design meets this requirement … in just the same way the Church may tell the politician what ends the social order should promote; but it must leave to the politician the devising of the precise means to those ends.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Three ends of Public Life</b><br><br>The three ends that Temple advocated were fundamentally biblical:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Freedom, fellowship, and service – these are the three principles of a Christian social order, derived from the still more fundamental Christian postulates that man is a child of God and destined for a life of eternal fellowship with Him.”</div></blockquote>

<p>So, first, Temple was concerned that the social order should reflect the widest possible opportunities for personal responsibility and <i>freedom</i>. That is why he supported democracy as a form of government – it provides a chance for each person, even if only indirectly, to be involved and exercising a small measure of responsibility. But Temple wanted freedom and responsibility to be positive – not just “freedom from”, but “freedom for” creative and selfless living. <br><br>Secondly, Temple saw social <i>fellowship </i>as an important end that needs to be put on the public agenda. This is because much political theory focuses exclusively on the individual on the one hand, and on the State on the other hand. So the debates focus around freedom, liberty and human rights, as individual concerns; and around peace, justice and the economy, as State concerns.<br><br>But the social order is not just made up of individuals and the State. For there are “mediating” communities. Paramount among these is the family. So no political theory is adequate that fails to do justice to the family. It is, in fact, in the mediating communities – the buffer groups between the individual and the state – that liberty is experienced.<br><br>However, the family, although important, is not the only such community. For example, there are also schools, colleges, professional associations, and, of course, the churches. It is a fact that revolutionary politics either ignores or tries to destroy these subordinate groups. But the health of a society is intimately linked with its mediating structures. So obviously a key means of weakening, if not destroying, the whole social fabric is to attack these structures. That is why current questions that relate to the health of the “marriage family” are so critical. It is, after all, in families that cultural and religious values are transmitted most effectively.<br><br>Thirdly, Temple stressed <i>service</i> as an end in the social order. From a Christian point of view, he said, this begins with fulfilling one’s calling. It also will mean an emphasis on duties rather than rights. So Temple regretted that in the history of political ideas Rousseau (1712-1778) and then Marx (1818-1883) “taught the democratic movement to take its stand on rights.” But there is only one safe way to true social progress. And that is not to be found in rights but in duties. True, duties are the other side of the coin to rights. “But the difference in the temper of the movement that rests on rights will be aggressive, violent, contentious, [<i>while</i>] the temper of a movement that rests on duties will be persuasive, public spirited and harmonious.” <br><b><br>Conclusion<br></b><br>Temple died before he witnessed the erosion of our sexual culture and some of the modern attacks on the “marriage family”. He would have been horrified by the fact that while the folly of Marxist economics has been exposed, the folly of Marxist family policy has not. The view in Marx and Engels’<i> Communist Manifesto</i> of the “bourgeois clap trap about the family and education, about the hallowed relation of parent and child” is, sadly, alive and well. But this and other issues will have to wait until Part III.<br><br>[<i>This is an edited and updated version of an extract from my </i>A Nation Under God (Kingsway, 1987). <i>Part III on modern issues is to follow</i>.]<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Growing to 2000: The Next Step">(June 2013) Growing to 2000: The Next Step</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2013</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><i><br>(Jesmond Parish Church is praying to grow to 2000 over the next five years as part of a larger project. A church meeting was held on 20 May to explain the next step. Below is a transcript of my address that followed the presentation by Jonathan Pryke.)<br></i><br>Some of us heard recently, at Prom Praise in the Sage in Gateshead, Peter Kerridge of <i>Premier Radio</i> say that in our region on a Sunday 97½ percent of the population will not be in church. That means that out of an Anglican Parish’s average size of 4000 people, 3,900 will not be in church (of any denomination) on a Sunday. And that is critical. For without a common belief system, at some point there will be social break down. When that happens, it is frightening.<br><b><br>Vision<br></b><br>So how should we respond to this in the light of our vision at JPC for Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain coupled with our JPC Founders’ vision of being “a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth in a growing and populous town [<i>or city</i>]”?<br><br>With regard to church growth, a few years ago the staff ministry-area leaders and then, independently, a September lay-leaders conference came up with the same numbers for us to pray and work towards. Jonathan Pryke has spoken of this specific vision, namely for a fellowship of 10,000 people being discipled - with 5000 in church plants and 5000 in JPC (but on a number of sites or campuses). <br><br>A plant is a separate daughter church while a site or campus is part of the mother-church’s structure. This means, for example, all the children’s work on such a campus is under one senior children’s co-ordinator with the benefits from economies of scale and the gifts of leadership. <br><br>Such a multi-site model of working will not be an innovation of JPC. It is already happening around the country (and in the Church of England). And it has to happen, if we are not to let some strategic churches (of all denominations) in England go into extinction because of dwindling congregations and a lack of full time leadership.<br><br>Now I have mentioned our “vision” and values because there are always five things prominent in churches that are growing in spiritual health and in numbers. And the first is their vision under God. <br><br>But then there is the Bible, prayer, strong but shared leadership and common sense in terms of management and responding to needs. So how do those four relate to our present situation at JPC? Can I start with the Bible and one thing I am convinced is relevant.<br><b><br>The Bible</b><br><br>It is Luke 12 where Jesus is talking about the final Judgment Day and how we must be ready for that day. He says that means that, even when there is a delay, we should make sure we grasp the opportunities that God is giving us. Jesus teaches this by way of warning through his Parable of “The Absent Master with three Unready Servants”.<br><br>One of these servants is positively irresponsible, getting violent and drunk. The other two simply do nothing and so are irresponsible by the sin of omission. One of the two is knowingly failing to act, while the other is ignorant of the master’s will (so he will get only “a light” punishment). But it is then that Jesus says – and so relevant to us - in the second half of verse 48 of chapter 12:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Everyone to whom much was [and is] given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.”</div></blockquote>

<p>When John Stott came to preach at JPC in the early 1970s, just after I had arrived and the church was much smaller, he said to me words to this effect, “you have a great opportunity here.” Since then one of my jobs has been and, still will be, to encourage people to take the opportunities God gives us. So I thank God for all the people who have grasped past opportunities and helped the church get to this point in its history. It has certainly been great team work of literally, over the years, thousands of volunteers and many staff. Through their efforts, all of us (and I certainly include myself) have been given so much from the ministry of others.<br><br>But we are now at this fork in the road. The PCC and the staff ministry-area leaders and myself believe there are great opportunities before us that God is calling us to, as Jonathan has been detailing. So how are we going to respond to them and that Parable with Jesus’ conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Everyone to whom much was [and is] given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more”?</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Prayer</b><br><br>One response must be prayer - another mark of a spiritually healthy and growing church. This is where Luke 11 is so relevant with Jesus’ teaching on the Lord’s Prayer and the Parable of “The Friend at Midnight”. He then gives us these promises in verses 9-10:</p>

<blockquote><div>“ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.”</div></blockquote>

<p>And he concludes by saying that prayer for the Holy Spirit will always be answered. So we can pray for the Holy Spirit’s help for discernment and for his help for any opportunities that God puts before us. Is it not amazing – or it should not be amazing – that once people started to pray for the church to grow to 2000 in five years, this opportunity for us to take on St Joseph’s came up? Of course, the confirmation of all this will be our financial support, as it was with the Curate’s House (now 56 Holly Avenue), the South Gallery, Eslington House, 3 Osborne Road and Holy Trinity Gateshead.<br><br>I heard a comment last week with regard to such needs as we now have. The speaker said that “if the size is not intimidating to you, it might be insulting to God.” So we trust £1,500,000 will not be insulting to God! In our praying we must remember Ephesians 3.20-21. In verse 21 we are told that God wants us to pray for “glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations”. How God must be grieved with<i> this</i> generation when he sees churches collapsing. And how we ought to pray believing, on the basis of verse 20, that God “is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think [<i>listen</i>] according to the power <i>at work</i> [present tense, i.e now] within us.” May that characterize our prayer as a church. <br><br>So we need vision, the Bible and prayer, but then leadership that is strong but shared.<br><br><b>Leadership and common sense</b><br><br>If we are to get to 2000 with double the staff numbers, as I have explained on more than one occasion, we will need some major changes in staff structures. As vicar I will need to be more a chairman with certain legal responsibilities, with a mentoring and advisory role and involved in more writing and wider affairs. Jonathan Pryke needs to be more the Senior Minister and treated like a new vicar who is in for the long-haul, with hands on leadership and with people aware of that. And the responsibilities and relationships of the other staff<i> and</i> volunteer leaders will also need to be reviewed. <br><br>Time forbids me to say much about common sense in terms of management and responding to needs, except that, of course, we can improve; and critically we need to be responsive to the younger electronic generation.<br><br>But thank God for having got us this far, so that it seems he can present us with new challenges and new opportunities as Jonathan has explained. <br><br>So let us now pray. As yesterday was Pentecost Sunday, here is a special Pentecost prayer (from <i>Contemporary Parish Prayers</i>):</p>

<blockquote><div>“Heavenly Father, by the power of your Holy Spirit set our hearts on fire with a new love for Christ, that we may be alive to the opportunities of these times and bear our witness with urgency and zeal. Save us from complacency and from fear of new ways; inspire our minds with the vision of a world won for our Lord; and stir our wills to pray and work until your will is done, for Jesus’ sake. Amen.”</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="The Demographic Deficit - Changing Britain (Part III)">(August 2013) The Demographic Deficit - Changing Britain (Part III)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2013</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p>One of the most challenging factors about modern life in Britain, and even more so in Europe and other parts of the world, is the demographic deficit caused by population decline or imbalance. <br><b><br>Some history<br></b><br>The post-World War II “baby boom” ended in the 1960s. For many years after that a common assumption was that the problem with the world was over-population. Paul Ehrlich’s 1968 book, the <i>Population Bomb</i>, was given great publicity, along with a general philosophy that small is always beautiful. Ehrlich argued that over-population was going to destroy parts of the planet with “hundreds of millions … going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs [<i>to help</i>]”. (This was more or less T R Malthus’ view, an 18th century demographer, who said that sooner or later if populations grow there will not be enough food to feed them). So population reduction, including reduction in developing countries (thereby to reduce fossil fuel consumption), became a global good and a global responsibility.<br><br>But good intentions can have unintended consequences, especially with demographic interventions, as in the 1990s people began to realise. In 1996 there was an (early warning) article entitled, “The world’s most intractable problem” by Barbara Beck in the <i>The Economist</i> publication, “The World in 1996”. This highlighted the simple fact that people are living longer and “the number of births is increasing more slowly” (and this is global). It meant for us in Britain that in 1995 24% of the population were 65 or older and 46% were of working age. But (if things stayed the same) in 2040 39% would be 65 or older and 32% of working age. But compared with Japan that was no problem at all. For in 1995 20% of Japanese were 65 or older and 56% of working age; but in 2040 52% would be 65 or older and only 20% of working age. Even so, why should we worry – it was a long time ahead? And in the UK and the developing world much of this was due to advances in medicine, so thank God. Yes, people have smaller families in poorer countries when they do not have to allow for infant mortality; and smaller is cheaper. And “smaller is cheaper” appeals in developed countries as well. Indeed, with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the advent of a market economy, it was reported that people did not want babies in the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Indeed, rich countries were all adjusting their fertility down, as people found children expensive and, to some degree, inconvenient for their desired lifestyles. But what is the result in 2013? Birth rates in Japan and Europe are now well below replacement level. And people are worried. Paul Ehrlich has lost support, as famines have been caused more by corrupt governments than over-population and it is seen that fertility rates were declining even when he first wrote, and have been since (except for a tiny 3% of the world). <br><br>In 1996 low fertility was seen fundamentally as a pension problem in developed countries (pensions always having to be funded by the successor generation and if that is getting smaller, of course, that is serious). Not far behind pensions were worries about medical expenses for the elderly.  So what can be done? There were six basic suggestions in the 1990s and they are still being suggested today: i) secure higher birth rates to swell the numbers contributing; but that, it was said, was not on as “people are not easily persuaded to have more children for the greater good, if fewer would be better for them personally”; ii) have a flow of immigrants; “but such a flow creates its own problems”; iii) reduce pensions; iv) raise taxes; v) expand private provision; and vi) put up the retirement age. Because all of these have costly political price tags, and politicians only need to plan 5 years until the next election, few will vote for unpopular measures that may benefit another government and will benefit another generation.<br><br>However, what did not, and does not, feature in much of this discussion as a cause for not having babies, is the loss of the Christian faith and with it the Christian sex ethic. We now know that a number of factors from the 1960s sexual revolution have all contributed to a decline of fertility - sexually transmitted diseases; the wide availability of contraception and abortion; pornography; cohabitation; the divorce epidemic; the decline of traditional marriage; people marrying later in life as well as an increase in female education (a good thing) and jobs without concessions to mothers. <br><b><br>Some facts<br></b><br>And there <i>is</i> a definite decline in the UK fertility rate – that is the average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The golden number for replacement is an average of 2.1 but we are well below that. The figures for the first decade of the 21st century in the UK were, 1.74 (in 2000); 1.73; 1.73; 1.66; 1.66; 1.66; 1.66; 1.66; 1.66; 1.66 (in 2009). In the last three years numbers have gone up to 1.92; 1.91; 1.91 (in 2012) – due to older women conceiving while immigrant (foreign born) mothers now account for 25% of the births. The average European Union figures are far worse – in  2010 they were 1.58 (with, for example, Italy 1.32; Greece 1.37; Germany 1.42; Spain 1.47; Belgium 1.65; but France, much better, 1.97). And those numbers generate “demographic momentum”. So populations grow while in decline. Jonathan Last, a demographer, concisely summarizes the principle as follows. “Consider a town composed of 10 young couples (population 20). Each couple then has three children, giving our town a total population of 50. If those children all marry and each couple has two children of their own, the population swells to 80. On the surface it looks as though our town is growing, even as fertility is slowing. Now suppose the next generation has (on average) 1.5 children per couple. Even as our original inhabitants die off, the town’s population increases again to 83. However, our little town’s fertility rate has fallen by 50 percent (from 3 to 1.5)! Yet its population keeps growing because of demographic momentum – the built-up supply of people from earlier generations. The rule of demographic momentum is this: <i>You don’t see the effects of fertility decreases until the last above-replacement generation dies</i>. Now let’s say the fourth generation in our town holds the fertility line at 1.5. The town’s second generation is elderly and as they die the population <i>does fall to 70.” </i><br><br>The fact for us in the UK is that our demographics demand massive immigration. In the last week of July it was reported that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is saying net immigration would have to rise to an average of 260,000 a year over the next 50 years to keep debt (as a proportion of GDP) at current levels. A recent study (<i>Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future</i>) argued that to keep “dependency ratios” (of workers to retirees) constant between 2000 and 2050, Europe will have to admit more than 1.3 billion immigrants by the middle of the century! As things stand it would seem the most available will be from the Islamic world of Turkey, the Middle East, North Africa and the horn of Africa. That has consequences.<br><br>Even more serious for global stability are the problems in Russia. In 2005 Russia had 143 million. By 2025 it is projected to be down to 136 million  (or even 121 million). There are a combination of possible causes - from abortion (with 30% more abortions than births), the world’s highest rate of divorce, a tripling of births outside marriage, and disease (not least alcoholism). All this explains why President Putin is more dictatorial than expected and has just passed strict laws against homosexual sex (which is sterile) and was strict against the sexually decadent “Pussy Riot” group. And China, too, is hugely vulnerable from its “One child” policy. By 2050, the country will be falling by 20 million every 5 years. One in four will be over 65. All of this is why it is shocking that David Cameron wants to export “Gay Marriage” globally and so further destabilize marriage. Doing so would encourage the “Demographic Transition” (which is now) when, instead of being family and then child centred, the individual’s self-actualization displaces children and the family. So children become just a lifestyle choice. And these ideas are spreading world-wide, according to recent research, even among Muslim women. By contrast, hope for the world is from a return to, or adoption of, the sex and marriage ethics of Christ. Interestingly, a survey found that women for whom religion was very important had a fertility rate of 2.3; for secular women it was 1.8. <br><b><br>Conclusion - an ancient example<br></b><br>The early Church was facing a similar demographic deficit. Julius Caesar and then Augustus and other Roman Emperors  passed laws to promote marriage and fertility. But such measures failed. The result was that as early as the 2nd century slaves, gladiators and foreign mercenaries had to fill the ranks of the army. “Meanwhile,” writes Rodney Stark in his book <i>The Rise of Christianity</i>, “in keeping with the biblical injunction to ‘be fruitful and multiply,’ Christians maintained a substantial rate of natural <i>increase</i>.” They “outbred” the pagan world. Marriage was honoured, but abortion, infanticide, divorce and remarriage, cohabitation, sex outside marriage and homosexuality and bisexuality were certainly not. There were people in the church who had sinned in these ways and were forgiven, together with people who would have loved to have had children but for different reasons could not. But people were taught to live for Christ chastely, whether single or married; and if married with children, to be concerned not primarily for their own fulfilment but for Christ’s glory, the family of the church, their own families and children, and <i>only then</i> themselves. The result was the sub-title of Stark’s book: “How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries.” <br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Does God get Angry?">(September 2013) Does God get Angry?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2013</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b><br>Late Summer Sermon Series<br></b><br>In our 2013 late Summer Series of sermons on the Old Testament book of the prophet Zechariah, my task was to start the series at the beginning of August with chapter 1 verses 1-6 where 1-3 say this:</p>

<blockquote><div>(1) In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, (2) The LORD was very angry with your fathers. (3) Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.</div></blockquote>

<p>My second of two opening points related to verse 2 and “Zechariah’s burning conviction”, namely that the Lord had been “very angry with your fathers.” I said the following [<i>see sermon transcript, 11 August 2013</i>]: “God was telling Zechariah that he was not <i>just</i> angry but <i>‘very’</i> angry.” Then to counter the belief that such ideas as God being angry are just Old Testament, I said: “Jesus teaches that God is love and loving … but he also teaches that God can be sometimes angry. In that great discourse of Jesus in John chapter 3 Jesus tells Nicodemus in verse 16: ‘For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.’ But then (20 verses later) in John 3 verse 36 he says: ‘Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.’ However, God’s anger is not unreasonable like much human anger. Rather it is his judicial holy reaction to human wickedness and sinfulness. And this anger is spoken about throughout the New Testament. So Zechariah knew that our God is not a benign old man who turns a blind eye to all that is evil. No! He is a God capable of great and terrifying anger at evil. True, this is not the first thing Zechariah tells those depressed and dejected returnees. But it was a fundamental assumption behind all he taught. And it is a fundamental assumption behind, and included in, the gospel Christ taught.”<br><b><br>The Church Times report (9 August 2013 edition) <br></b><br>Literally just before going down to church for the morning services that Sunday, I picked up the <i>Church Times </i>and read the following headline: “‘<i>The wrath of God was satisfied’ loses hymn its place in new book.”</i> The report that followed said this: “The popular Evangelical hymn ‘in Christ alone’, which was sung at the Archbishop of Canterbury's enthronement service, has not been included in a new collection of hymns because it contains a line about the satisfaction of God's wrath. The hymn was considered by the Presbyterian Committee on Congregational Song (PCOCS) for inclusion in a hymnal that is due to be published this year by the Presbyterian Church of the United States (PCUSA), <i>Glory to God.”</i> We were then told that “in May, Mary Louise Bringle, the Chair of the PCOCS, said that the committee had initially voted for ‘In Christ alone’, by Keith Getty and Stuart Townend, to be included in the hymn book. It intended for the hymn to be published with the line, ‘Till on that cross as Jesus died <i>the love of God was magnified.’”</i> However, Mary Bringle wrote: “In the process of clearing copyrights for the hymnal we discovered that this version of the text would not be approved by the authors, as it was considered too great a departure from the original words: ‘as Jesus died “the wrath” of God was satisfied.’ We were faced, then, with a choice: to include the hymn with the authors’ original language or to remove it from our list.” In the event the PCOCS voted by 9 to 6 against including ‘In Christ alone’ in the hymnal with the original lyrics, “with deep regret over losing its otherwise poignant and powerful witness”. The majority view of the committee was that it did not wish “to perpetuate … the view that the cross is primarily about God’s need to assuage God’s anger”.<br><br>The <i>Church Times</i> then reminded us that “writing … in 2010, the then Precentor of Salisbury Cathedral, Canon Jeremy Davies, said that he found it ‘very difficult to sing’ the line about God's wrath being satisfied. ‘Are we really to believe that the angry God, propitiated by a blameless victim, is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ?’” Next the <i>Church Times</i> mentioned Tom Wright. “Writing on the Fulcrum website in 2007 … the former Bishop of Durham, recommended that the line be changed to ‘Till on the cross as Jesus died <i>the love of God was satisfied.’</i> There was a danger, he argued, of people presenting ‘over simple stories with an angry God and a loving Jesus, with a God who demands blood and doesn't much mind whose it is as long as it's innocent. You'd have thought people would notice that this flies in the face of John's and Paul's deep-rooted theology of the love of the triune God: not ‘God was so angry with the world that he gave us his son’ but ‘God so loved the world that he gave us his son.’” The report concluded with a reference to the Revd Steve Chalke, “a prominent Baptist minister” who “was criticised by some Evangelicals, in 2004, for describing the penal substitutionary model of the atonement as ‘a form of cosmic child abuse - a vengeful Father, punishing his son’.”<br><br>Such controversy is not new. But how is it that such able people argue against a common-sense reading of the New Testament? Many things can be said, not least the fact of a woodenness with regard to the metaphors in the hymn’s traditional atonement theology. What convinced me, as a student, of this traditional view (apart from a common-sense reading of Paul) were Jesus’ words in Mark 10.45: “even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve¸ and to give his life as a ransom <i>for</i> many.” The preposition “for” in this context in the original means “in the place of” many. However, a basic problem is the reality (or not) of God’s “anger” or “wrath” and which is associated with the Final Judgment. That many find even more unacceptable.<br><b><br>God’s “wrath” and the Final Judgement <br></b><br>So what can claim to be biblical teaching on God’s wrath – for now and for the future? Dr J I Packer wrote a book entitled <i>Concise Theology</i> with articles on a range of Christian doctrines and concepts. These in slightly abbreviated form appear now in<i> The </i>(ESV) <i>Reformation Study Bible </i>(edited by R.C.Sproul). The (abbreviated) article entitled<i> The Final Judgment</i> is a helpful summary. Let me quote it verbatim.</p>

<blockquote><div>The certainty of final judgement is the background against which the New Testament message of saving grace is set. Paul no less than Jesus stresses this certainty. According to Paul, Jesus Christ saves us from “the wrath to come” (1 Thess 1.10) on “the day of wrath when God's righteous judgement will be revealed” (Rom 2.5; cf. John 3.36; Rom 5.9; Eph 5.6; Col 3.6; Rev 6.17; 19,15). Throughout Scripture, God’s  “indignation,” “anger,” and “fury” are judicial; these words point to the holy Creator as the active Judge of sin. The message of coming judgement for all mankind, with Jesus Christ completing the work of his mediatorial kingdom by acting as Judge on his Father's behalf, runs throughout the New Testament (Matt 13.40-43; 25.41-46; John 5.22-30; Acts 10.42; 2 Cor 5.10; 2 Tim 4.1; Heb 9.27; 10.25-31; 12.23; 2 Pet 3.7; Jude 6.7; Rev 20.11-15). When Christ comes again and history is completed, all people of all times will be raised for the judgement and take their place before Christ’s throne. The event surpasses imagination, but the human imagination is not the measure of what God will do.At the judgement every person will give an individual account to God, and God through Christ “will render to each one according to his works” (Rom 2.6; cf. Ps 62.12; Matt 16.27; 2 Cor 5.10; Rev 22.12). The regenerate, who as servants of Christ have learned to love righteousness and desire the glory of heaven, will be acknowledged, and on the basis of Christ's merit on their behalf they will be awarded the righteousness they seek. The rest will go to a destiny commensurate with the godless way of life they have chosen, a place assigned to them on the basis of their own demerit (Rom 2.6-11). How much they knew of the will of God will determine the severity of their condemnation (Matt 11.20-24; Luke 11.42-48; Rom 2.12). The judgment will demonstrate the perfect justice of God. In a world of sinners, where God has “allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways” (Acts 14.16), evil is rampant, and doubts arise about how God, if he is sovereign, can be just, or, if he is just, can be sovereign. But God will be glorified in rendering just judgement, and the Last Judgement will answer every suspicion that he has ceased to care about righteousness (Ps 50.16-21; Rev 6.10; 16.5-7; 19.1-5).For those who profess to belong to Christ, a review of their words and works (Matt 12.36, 37) will show whether their profession is the fruit of an honest and good heart (Matt 12.33-35), or a deceptive hypocrisy (Matt 7.21-23). Everything will be exposed on Judgement Day (1 Cor 4.5), and each person will receive from God what fairly belongs to them. Those whose professed faith did not express itself in a new life, marked by hatred of sin and love of righteousness, will be lost (Matt 18.23-35; 25. 34-46; James 2.14-26). Yet God has announced the day of judgement before the time, commanding everyone to repent and love life rather than death (Deut 30.19; Luke 13. 24).</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Fundamental in all this is the fact that the opposite of God’s “wrath” is not “love” but “neutrality” to human sin. Because of the reality of his wrath, which in no way is irrational and vengeful as human wrath can be, God the Father’s love means that by God the Holy Spirit, through prophets and apostles, he warns us to repent (to rethink and turn around) trusting in God the Son, “Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come” (1 Thess 1.10). That is good news.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Religion of the Self">(October 2013) The Religion of the Self</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2013</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The Girl Guide Promise</b><br><br>There was a problem at the beginning of last month. On 1 September 2013 the Girl Guide promise, “the beating heart of guiding” according to the Chief Guide, was to change. The promise that was being discarded was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>I promise that I will do my bestTo love my GodTo serve the Queen and my countryTo help other peopleAnd to keep the Brownie/Guide Law</div></blockquote>

<p>Instead it was mandated from Girlguiding’s central authority that from the 1 September every girl and leader must say these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>I promise that I will do my bestTo be true to myself and develop my beliefsTo serve the Queen and my communityTo help other peopleAnd to keep the Brownie/Guide Law</div></blockquote>

<p>Jesmond Parish Church sponsored brownie and guide units are refusing to make the new promise. They are right to do so for at least five reasons.<br><b><br>Girlguiding’s charitable object and agreements<br></b><br><i>First</i>, Brownie/Guide Law requires it! The charitable object of Girlguiding is to help girls “develop emotionally, mentally, physically <i>and spiritually</i>”. For our units at JPC that has to be in the context of the sponsorship agreements. These require that “in accordance with the Guiding Manual all members are encouraged to be active in a religious faith”; and a similar requirement is in the Guiding Manual itself in the section entitled, <i>Equality and Diversity – Spirituality</i> and as updated on 9 September 2013. Of course, the religious faith in which our parents know their girls will be encouraged to be active, and for which many parents choose our groups, is that of the community of JPC – a Christian Church. But both Jesus and the Apostles make it clear that the “self” cannot always be seen as a source of enlightenment and an object for commitment to which you should be true. For sometimes a person’s “self” is a dark and conflicting source of deception and to be resisted. This biblical psychology is expressed in Ephesians 4.18-24 that says people can be …</p>

<blockquote><div>… darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. But that is not the way you learned Christ! – assuming you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.</div></blockquote>

<p>So the question for the Christian is, “to which self are you to be true?” The Christian must never promise simply to be “true to myself” but only “true to the self that I am called to be by God”. Even many secular psychologists and therapists have distinguished “the self as I am” from “the self as I ought to be”. <br><b><br>Psychological Problems<br></b><br>So, <i>secondly,</i> this promise has problems psychologically. In his much acclaimed book <i>Psychology as Religion – the cult of self-worship</i>, Paul Vitz, professor of psychology at New York University, sees this failure to define the self as a serious problem. There are, indeed, “many conflicting parts and layers of the self … If so, which is the ‘real’ self? How does one choose among the various selves.” Philosophically each is “real”.<br><br>Another psychologist, Philip Cushman, argues that the “self” is defined by the individual’s particular group or historical context. For example, the 20th century saw a change from a version of the “self” where people needed to save money and restrict their sexual and aggressive impulses. A new “self”, then, emerged that felt the deep need to spend money for happiness and to follow a range of impulses in what has been called “self-actualization”. The earlier “self” was more focused on developing a moral and religious character, while the new “self” seeks to be free from outside authority and “find its own moral compass” (to quote the Chief Guide). But what if the compass lacks a true moral north? Girls being true to a “self” that is materialistic and gives free rein to sexual and other instincts is surely not in line with the charitable object of Girlguiding.<br><b><br>Contrary to the Christian Faith<br></b><br><i>Thirdly,</i> this promise is clearly contrary to Christian anthropology (the Christian doctrine of man). Vitz puts it like this: “Jesus Christ neither lived not advocated a life that would qualify by today’s standards as ‘self-actualized’. For the Christian, the self is the problem, not the potential paradise. Understanding this problem involves <i>an awareness of sin,</i> especially the sin of pride; correcting this condition requires the practice of such unself-actualized states as contrition and penitence, humility, obedience and trust in God.”<br><br>Fundamental to Christian ethics is the fact that humankind is made in God’s image, created for fellowship with God, and Jesus reveals not only true God but also true man. But fundamental also is this awareness of sin. The reality is that men and women, by nature, do not put God first, others second, and themselves last. Rather they put themselves first. However, such an understanding, having been overlooked by many in the Western world for so long, is now being recovered. Hobart Mowrer has written: “For several decades we psychologists looked upon the whole matter of sin and moral accountability as a great incubus and acclaimed our liberation from it as epoch-making. But at length we have discovered that to be ‘free’ in this sense, i.e., to have the excuse of being ‘sick’ rather than sinful, is to court the danger of also becoming lost.” <br><br>This “lostness” can be evidenced in people seeking, like the guides, to “develop their own beliefs”. But to put such weight on our “free” selves, in Mowrer’s words, is to “have cut the very roots of our being; lost our deepest sense of self-hood and identity; and with neurotics themselves, find ourselves asking: ‘who <i>am </i>I?’” To have a new promise that may do that hardly helps girls “develop emotionally” – a part of the object of Girlguiding.<br><b><br>Responsibility and Guilt<br></b><br><i>Fourthly</i>, this promise does not help girls deal with guilt. The doctrine of sin encourages a sense of responsibility for our own behaviour and so gives us true significance. But with responsibility goes guilt, if we are irresponsible; and guilt needs to be dealt with to avoid self-hatred. The Christian good news is that where there is “repentance toward God and … faith in our Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts 20.21), in God’s mercy there is forgiveness and an erasing of guilt. This is through Christ’s death for us, and instead of us, on the Cross where he bore our punishment. <i>How </i>that is possible is a great mystery; but that it is possible is a great truth.<br><br>Today, however, there has been an eclipse of guilt by shame. Shame is possible as it simply relates to how ashamed we feel before other people. But selfism has no place for guilt as guilt has to do with the violation of an external standard (so for a guilty verdict in a court a jury is not concerned with how ashamed the defendant feels but whether objectively the law has been broken). To encourage a girl in her delusion that there is no objective divine moral law but all is from her own self, is cruel as well as spiritually and psychologically damaging.<br><b><br>Illegal<br></b><br><i>Fifthly</i>, English State law means the promise is illegal. The doctrine of the (established) Church of England is defined (by law) by <i>The Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974</i>. Section 5.1 refers to the Thirty-nine Articles and Article XXXIX forbids “vain” or “rash” promise making. So for a Christian guide unit leader or a sponsoring church (such as JPC) to be endorsing a vain or rash promise is contrary to the law; and Church of England clergy are doctrinally bound by Section 5.1! But this new promise is either vain if it is judged to be (in the language of <i>The Observer</i> newspaper) “gobbledygook”. It is rash if it is understood but the implications are not thought through, and it is not seen how, in effect, this is a secularist imposition and a quite unacceptable form of spiritual discrimination in forcing girls and leaders to make promises against their consciences.<br><br>Of course, some people will say the new promise simply means “doing what is right rather than going with the crowd”. But that is not its meaning in our post-modern historical context; and we are told that girl guides themselves are saying it means to “think of your self first and be selfish.” The hard reality is that this new promise is, whether intentionally or not, <i>a move for exclusion</i>. Secularists (often oblivious to their religion of the self) are allowed to say the promise with a good conscience, but not Christians. So much for Girlguiding’s equality and diversity policy! Their founder Baden-Powell would be horrified.<br><b><br>Conclusion<br></b><br>JPC Brownies and Guides are not proposing to disband. They will be enrolling girls using the promise that was in use prior to 1st September. There are various ways forward. Please pray for the right one.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="C S Lewis, Old Books, J C Ryle and Relevant Holiness">(December 2013) C S Lewis, Old Books, J C Ryle and Relevant Holiness</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2013</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>C S Lewis</b><br><br>On 22 November 2013 a memorial stone in honour of C S Lewis was unveiled in Poets’ Corner at Westminster Abbey on the 50th anniversary of his death. He was given a place alongside the likes of Jane Austen, Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles Dickens, Ted Hughes and William Shakespeare. He was, of course, the creator of <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>. Born in 1898 he studied classics and philosophy at University College, Oxford where he excelled academically and stayed on studying English literature and teaching philosophy. From 1925-54 he became a Fellow and Tutor at Magdalen College, Oxford teaching English and in 1954 he moved to Cambridge and became Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English Literature until his death in November 1963. <br><br>His death, as far as the public was concerned, was overshadowed by two other deaths the same day, namely those of US President J F Kennedy and the novelist Aldous Huxley. But it can be argued that as far as global significance is concerned, C S Lewis with his Christian essays and books will have been the most significant of the three. For through huge book sales, he undoubtedly was a major factor in the growth of world Christianity in the second half of the 20th century. Translated into 40 languages <i>The Chronicles of Narnia have sales figures of three million annually. And still selling well is Lewis’ Mere Christianity</i> – his introduction to the Christian faith. This book in the words of Francis Collins, the head of the Human Genome Project, is “the very best book to put in the hands of a young seeker who is trying to figure out if there is rationality for faith”. How we should thank God for the life and work of C S Lewis!<br><b><br>Reading Old Books<br></b><br>Personally, I came across C S Lewis early in life (and before he was so popular). For on going to my senior school in the early 1950s, aged 13, my entry form was introduced to Lewis by our Form Master who had just come down from Magdalen College, Oxford, where Lewis had been his own personal tutor. He decided we “entry-formers” should all have copies of <i>Mere Christianity</i> for our “Scripture Lessons”. The book did not make a great impact upon me at the time. However, much later in life I came to see the value of C S Lewis. I particularly found helpful the little book of essays and papers entitled, <i>First and Second Things</i>, containing an article written in 1944. It was headed <i>On the Reading of Old Books</i>. In my edition I have underlined the following paragraph: “Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books.” This is one of the reasons why Lewis suggested that “after reading a new book” you should never allow “yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between. If that is too much for you, you should at least read one old one to every three new ones.”<br><br>From then on I have tried to follow Lewis’ advice and, I believe, with benefit. It certainly has affected my own thinking. One of the first “old” books at that time that I read was <i>Holiness</i> by J C Ryle, the first Bishop of Liverpool, and a feisty evangelical leader in the Church of England in the 19th century. The book proves Lewis’ point as it highlights the mistakes of many in the churches in the late 20th and early 21st centuries particularly in ignoring “holiness” in the search of an ever illusive “relevancy” to win outsiders. This has been a regular call over the past year in the debates over gay marriage and women bishops. It seems to be ending up saying that unless the Church goes along with homosexual and feminist agendas, it will be irrelevant to modern people. But Ryle would argue that holiness is not, and cannot be, in opposition to true relevance. For what could be more relevant than providing bench-marks for evaluating these agendas and seeing what is destructive and what is constructive as regards individual and corporate well-being? Such is holiness. For it refers to the transcendent “other-ness” of God and his separation from sin and evil, and then to our being separated from evil and set apart for him. <br><br>But what practically is holiness? Well, here is a passage from that “old book” - Ryle’s <i>Holiness</i>, and a 12 point summary and good for an Advent spiritual health check (n.b. “man” in the following is, of course, generic and stands for “man” or “woman”; also scripture quotes are from the Authorized Version).<br><b><br>Ryle’s 12 points on holiness<br></b><br>1) Holiness is the habit of being of one mind with God, according as we find his mind described in Scripture. It is the habit of agreeing in God’s judgment, hating what he hates, loving what he loves, and measuring everything in this world by the standard of his Word …<br><br>2) A holy man will endeavour to shun every known sin and to keep every known commandment. He will have a decided bent of mind towards God, a hearty desire to do his will, a greater fear of displeasing him than of displeasing the world, and … will feel what Paul felt when he said “I delight in the law of God after the inward man” (Romans 7.22) …<br><br>3) A holy man will strive to be like our Lord Jesus Christ. He will not only live the life of faith in him, and draw from him all his daily peace and strength, but he will also labour to have the mind that was in him, and to be conformed to his image (Romans 8.29). It will be his aim to bear with and forgive others … to be unselfish … to walk in love … to be lowly-minded and humble … He will lay to heart the saying of John: “He that saith he abideth in [Christ] ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked” (1 John 2.6) …<br><br>4) A holy man will follow after meekness, longsuffering, gentleness, patience, kind tempers, government of his tongue. He will bear much, forbear much, overlook much, and be slow to talk of standing on his rights …<br><br>5) A holy man will follow after temperance and self-denial. He will labour to mortify the desires of his body, to crucify his flesh with his affections and lusts, to curb his passions, to restrain his carnal inclinations, lest at any time they break loose … (Ryle then quotes Luke 21.34, 1 Corinthians 9.27).<br><br>6) A holy man will follow after charity and brotherly kindness. He will endeavour to observe the golden rule of doing as he would have men do to him, and speaking as he would have men speak to him … He will abhor all lying, slandering, backbiting, cheating, dishonesty, and unfair dealing, even in the least things …<br><br>7) A holy man will follow after a spirit of mercy and benevolence towards others … Such was Dorcas: “full of good works and almsdeeds, which she did” – not merely purposed and talked about, but <i>did</i> … (Acts 9.36).<br><br>8) A holy man will follow after purity of heart. He will dread all filthiness and unclearness of spirit, and seek to avoid all things that might draw him into it. He knows his own heart is like tinder, and will diligently keep clear of the sparks of temptation …<br><br>9) A holy man will follow after the fear of God. I do not mean the fear of a slave, who only works because he is afraid of punishment and would be idle if he did not dread discovery. I mean rather the fear of a child, who wishes to live and move as if he was always before his father’s face, because he loves him …<br><br>10) A holy man will follow after humility. He will desire, in lowliness of mind, to esteem all others better than himself. He will see more evil in his own heart than any in other in the world …<br><br>11) A holy man will follow after faithfulness in all the duties and relations in life. He will try, not merely to fill his place as well as others who take no thought for their souls, but even better, because he has higher motives and more help than they … Holy persons should aim at doing everything well, and should be ashamed of allowing themselves to do anything ill if they can help it … They should strive to be good husbands and good wives, good parents and good children, good masters and good servants, good neighbours, good friends, good subjects, good in private and good in public, good in the place of business and good by their firesides. The Lord Jesus puts a searching question to his people, when he says, “What do you more than others?” (Matthew 5.47)<br><br>12) Last, but not least, a holy man will follow after spiritual-mindedness. He will endeavour to set his affections entirely on things above, and to hold things on earth with a very loose hand … He will aim to live like one whose treasure is in heaven, and to pass through this world like a stranger and pilgrim travelling to his home. To commune with God in prayer, in the Bible, and in the assembly of his people – these things will be the holy man’s chief enjoyments. He will value every thing and place and company just in proportion as it draws him nearer to God … <br><b><br>Conclusion<br></b><br>Practical holiness (or, as we might say, “Godly Living”) is relevant. It is also evangelistic, as Jesus said in his Sermon on the Mount: “let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 5.15). So thank God for lessons from (good) Old Books.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Challenges for 2014 and Fighting Back">(January 2014) Challenges for 2014 and Fighting Back</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2014</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The challenge</b><br><br>The Apostle Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 10.3-6 these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>“For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Undoubtedly there is a spiritual war going on in the West. Last year the <i>Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 201</i>3 was passed by Parliament in July and due to come into force in March. Then before Christmas there was a Report of the House of Bishops’ (of the Church of England) Working Group on Sexuality, chaired by Sir Joseph Pilling. This recommended services in the Church of England to celebrate permanent same-sex relationships, although it says there could be no formal liturgy for this, until the Church changes its teaching. Of course, that is tantamount to recommending a free-for-all and allowing churches, where the Vicar and PCC agree, to have blessings of Homosexual Marriages. Of this Working Group, shockingly, only one member objected – the Rt Rev Keith Sinclair, the Bishop of Birkenhead. The Bishop declined to sign the document. Instead he submitted an appendix outlining “his understanding of Scripture’s teaching on same-sex relationships”, as one Newspaper reported his submission: and that description in itself is an indication of spiritual drift. For even the Bishops’ (theologically liberal 1991 Statement)<i> Issues in Human Sexuality</i>, after examining the teaching of Scripture, had to admit the following:</p>

<blockquote><div>“There is, therefore, in Scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong, monogamous, heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings. Sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable.”</div></blockquote>

<p>So Keith Sinclair’s appendix was not just “his understanding of Scripture’s teaching on same-sex relationships”. It was that of the “One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ” – the church down the centuries that follows the Bible - a library of Apostolic teaching. (The Bible as we have it was in contrast to the spurious books of a host of Gnostic sects - the early versions of which are being opposed in Paul’s letter to the Colossians, John’s Epistles and the early chapters of the Book of Revelation).<br><b><br>The fight back and Pannenberg’s advice<br></b><br>How we need to fight back because of the damage done to our society by these innovations. We must take seriously those words from Paul in 2 Corinthians 10 (above) and then campaign to repeal this new marriage legislation that comes into in March. (For a fuller explanation of the damage this redefining of marriage will cause, see the <i>Coloured Supplement, April 2012).</i><br><br>In one sense what is happening has been going on for years. There has been little change in Europe, except for a worsening, over the last 20 years since the distinguished German theologian, Professor Wolfhart Pannenberg gave his 1994 important and helpful<i> Erasmus Lecture</i> and said this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“There are compelling reasons for Western Societies to try to recover their religious roots … Given alternative religious possibilities Western Societies are well advised to recover their religious roots in the cultural tradition informed by Jewish and Christian beliefs. Western ideas of human rights and especially the underlying conception of human freedom have their basis in these beliefs: in the Christian teaching that the individual person is the object of God’s eternal love and that human freedom has its source in the individual’s communion with God through faith, and in the Jewish understanding of the dignity of the human person as created in the image of God. In the light of these teachings, individual freedom cannot be unbridled licence.”</div></blockquote>

<p>He then went on to speak about the acids of secularism:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Secularism’s greatest success, however, is in the widespread demoralization in the ranks of the clergy and theologians who are supposed to proclaim and interpret the truth of the gospel but delude themselves that they are achieving that purpose by adapting Christian faith and life to the demands of secularism. What the situation requires, I am convinced, is precisely the opposite of such uncritical adaptations. The further secularism advances the more urgent it is that Christian faith and Christian life be seen in sharp contrast to the secular culture … What is needed is a strong reaffirmation of the central articles of Christian faith against the spirit of secularism and then a joining of that to a renewed commitment to rationality and ecumenical openness. Needless to say, such a combination is not easy.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Some explanation and comment</b><br><br>In the West secularism is particularly identified with sexuality and gender issues. These undoubtedly have been, and are, the motor for not only the disintegration of sexual ethics but of ethics in general. Looking back those 20 years since 1994 and the incursions of this sexualized secularism, it is easy to see how right Pannenberg was in his analysis. And how right he was in his call for “a strong reaffirmation of the central articles of Christian faith against the spirit of secularism.” However some further comment is necessary for 2014.<br><br>First, it is noticeable that Pannenberg, when rightly talking about one of the sources of human freedom being the “individual’s communion with God through faith”, omitted to say that it is “through faith <i>in Jesus Christ”</i>. And, secondly, a “renewed commitment to rationality and ecumenical openness” is absolutely essential, but needing more to be said. <br><br>On the one hand, the commitment to rationality has to go hand in hand with prayer for the Holy Spirit to open blind minds. What has happened since the 1990s has been a plethora of evangelically minded Christians seeking theological doctorates, which if they are good pieces of work, are indeed valuable. But they are not sufficient to win this spiritual war. The Book of Acts is clear that you need human witnesses to Jesus Christ to change minds but also, and vitally, the Holy Spirit to change hearts and wills. For the Bible’s anthropology says that what the heart desires, the will chooses and the mind rationalizes. So Peter and the Apostles, referring to Jesus’ life and work, said “we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him” (Acts 5.32). We also read about the conversion of Lydia, a great woman in the Church at Philippi, in these terms: “The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul” (Acts 16.14). That is why, to be a church of 2000 over the next four and a half years, at Jesmond Parish Church we need both a new concern for discipleship (literally, “learning”) but also faithful prayer - faithful in terms of our vision of the God who can do more abundantly than all we can ask or think.<br><br>Secondly, ecumenical openness means learning from other Christians in different denominations and, especially, other parts of the world, and being, as far as is possible, united with them. But ecumenical openness must also involve learning from, and being united with, the whole “church militant” – to use the old <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> phrase. That means learning from, and being united with, the Church down the centuries where the churches in history have been learning from, and united, with the Apostles and their teaching. And you are united with the Apostles as you read their teachings and records about, and witness, to Jesus in the Bible. Jesus’ famous prayer for unity in John 17.20-21 was in these terms:</p>

<blockquote><div>“I do not ask for these [his Apostles] only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word [Churches down the centuries], that they may all be one [the Apostles together with Churches down the centuries] just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us [the Apostles together with Churches down the centuries united intimately with God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit], so that the world may believe that you have sent me.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Respect and conclusion</b><br><br>With regard to the omission of <i>“through faith in Jesus Christ”</i>, and a caution in mentioning the name of “Jesus” (other than as an expletive), this is too frequent today from a fear of giving offence in a multi-cultural society. But this is often due to a wrong notion of “respect” for those with other beliefs or behaviours.<br><br>We must distinguish “respect” from “esteem”. As Christians we must “respect” everyone, whatever their beliefs or behaviours, as a human individual made in God’s image. Such respect does not admit of degrees. However, because of human sinfulnesss how we “esteem” or evaluate others (and ourselves) does, and should, admit of degrees. For it needs to be based on fact and reality. And the reality is that God is there; Jesus is risen and reigning; and Christian faith and ethics are the best for human flourishing (as social studies prove). So ignoring Jesus’ teaching on marriage and voting for homosexual marriage scores zero. Christian love, therefore, should motivate us to wage war, of course, not with lethal weapons or violently like some religious extremists, but peacefully with spiritual weapons – our teaching, our prayers, and our consequential action, where necessary.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Girlguiding's New Direction - Is It Really Wanted?">(February 2014) Girlguiding's New Direction - Is It Really Wanted?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2014</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Subtlety and deception</b><br><br>The Chief (UK) Guide still opposes the use of the old Girlguiding promise at Jesmond Parish Church (JPC) and has threatened closure. At the date of writing, discussions continue between JPC’s (church sponsored) Girlguiding groups and the Girlguiding authorities over the new promise which the JPC units oppose. This new promise has substituted “myself” for “God” as though that was a generous and inclusive move. It is, of course, nothing of the kind (see the JPC Coloured Supplement for October 2013,<i> The Religion of the Self</i>). <br><br>All this brings to mind a lecture given not so long ago in the United States on the secularizing of universities by the Christian social scientist, Richard Neuhaus. He pointed out that from the Middle Ages to the present – from Bologna and Oxford to Yale and Princeton …</p>

<blockquote><div>“… the university was explicitly constituted and inspired by Christian faith. In Harvard Yard one can still see the original seal with the word Veritas surrounded by the words Pro Christo et Ecclesia (for Christ and the Church). By the beginning of the twentieth century, that motto was reduced to just the one word, Veritas, and at Harvard there is obviously no consensus on what that truth might be, or even on whether there is such a thing as truth … When a university decides not to say that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life, it is not saying nothing. Rather, it is saying that adherence to this way, this truth, and this life is not necessary to, or is a hindrance to, being the kind of university it wants to be.” </div></blockquote>

<p>Neuhaus is arguing that such action does not make a university an open inclusive organization as though “secular” was a synonym for “neutral”. Rather it becomes subtly (and quietly) anti-Christ and anti-Christian. It then becomes pro “living-as-if-Christ-had-never-existed”; and this has ethical implications. <br><br>Something similar is happening with Girlguiding. By removing the theistic promise, not only ideas but ethics will change. Nor should we be surprised now that Julie Bentley is the relatively new (charity) Chief Executive of Girlguiding UK. Known as a pro-abortion campaigner and seeing Girlguiding as “the ultimate feminist organization”, her previous job was as CEO of the “sexual health charity <i>fpa</i>” (formerly the “Family Planning Association”) and whose large website has virtually nothing on marriage!<br><br>It is, of course, a free world. However, let no one be deceived about what is happening. Julie Bentley, and her supporters, are wanting to take Girlguiding in a positively secular and, therefore, exclusionary direction. But this is disfranchising church sponsored units as at JPC. Interestingly Julie Bentley says Girlguiding will not admit boys into the groups as it is very important that the Guide units “remain a safe girl only space.” So surely it would be particularly discriminatory to enforce the closure of conscientious Christian units with the option for a theistic promise being through joining the now mixed Scouts. <br><b><br>From “my country” to “my community”<br></b><br>But is this new direction in which Girlguiding is being taken what parents (and church sponsors) want and socially responsible? Many will say “No!” and this is not just because of the change from “God” to “myself”. For more than just committed Christians will be concerned about the second substantial change, namely the substitution of “community” for “country”. <br><br>The promise that has been discarded, except by Girlguiding units like those at Jesmond Parish Church, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>“I promise that I will do my best,To love my God,To serve the Queen and my country,To help other people,And to keep the Brownie/Guide Law.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Instead every new girl member and leader is supposed to say these words:</p>

<blockquote><div>“I promise that I will do my best,To be true to myself and develop my beliefs,To serve the Queen and my community,To help other people,And to keep the Brownie/Guide Law.”</div></blockquote>

<p>For her stand in opposing this promise, Glynis Mackie, our senior Guide Leader received over the pre-Christmas and New Year period, unpleasant letters and e-mails from various Girlguiding officials. These were to force her and the girls to change their minds and convictions. On the other hand, there was considerable media (including national media) and individual support from around the country including Northern Ireland. <br><br>For myself, as the signing sponsor of our units, over this period I simply wrote to the Chief Guide explaining how our units were being forced to act not only contrary to their consciences and faith, but also, in one particular, illegally. <br><br>Unfortunately, I had to be more concerned over this period for what was happening in the South Sudan. That was because of my involvement as a trustee of Anglican International Development (AID) in its appeal for $750,000 to help the International Christian Medical and Dental Association (ICMDA) set up an Institute of Health Sciences in Bor, in the South Sudan. <br><br>No one can be ignorant of the terrible suffering at this time in the South Sudan and especially in Jonglei State, with Bor (its capital) having some of the worst fighting. <br><br>We at AID have been receiving e-mails from the area reporting the shocking conditions and the horror of such civil strife; and there has been phone contact with our micro-finance office in Juba, the South Sudanese capital. In October four of us from JPC were in Juba (where the fighting started) and, Alice Madgwick with John-Inglis Jones, the AID Executive Officer, at that time were seeing in Bor health officials and filming for the appeal (and having an encounter with armed young men in the process). <br><br>So, on the one hand, I was receiving copies of e-mails to and from the various parties regarding the enforcement of a Girlguiding promise that had to stop promising to serve “my country” and start to promise to serve “my community”. On the other hand, at the same time, I was receiving horrific e-mails and reading other reports from the South Sudan. But the irony, indeed tragedy, was that the conflict in the South Sudan was precisely because many South Sudanese were putting “my community”, whether tribal, army or regional, before “my country”. They were now killing and displacing people (desperately poor, sick and, too often, bereaved people) and serving (lethally) “my community” and not “my country” which was being torn apart by such community and not country loyalty.<br><b><br>Communities 'taking law into their own hands'<br></b><br>My fear over this narrowing down of social loyalty for the UK was then confirmed by a report in <i>The Guardian</i> on 18 January, the day before JPC Girlguiding was to be “deregistered” by the new-broom Girlguiding authorities (however, there was a last minute stay of execution). The newspaper quoted Tom Winsor, the new (police) chief inspector of constabulary, as saying some communities in the UK now are “taking law into their own hands”:</p>

<blockquote><div>“There are some communities born under other skies who will not involve police at all … I am reluctant to name the communities in question but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves … There are cities in the Midlands where the police never go because they are never called. They never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own ... They just have their own form of community justice.”</div></blockquote>

<p>This is hugely serious for social cohesion. So do not girls in such places need to learn a loyalty to their country rather than to their community?<br><br>There is a political argument that democratic government requires <i>national </i>loyalties to be working and effective; and these loyalties need to be shared by government, opposition and electorate alike. For without that higher loyalty, opposition to the government can be seen as subversive, since with no higher loyalty chaos can result from the collapse of any government. Hence, some governments may rightly or wrongly cling to power to prevent such chaos. That may be true of the South Sudan which is a new nation and such nation building-up needs care and time to provide a shared history and culture. Raymond Johnston, former Church Warden at JPC and the founder of CARE, in his book, <i>Nationhood: towards a Christian Perspective</i>, tells of visiting broadcasters from developing countries to London asking of BBC broadcasters:</p>

<blockquote><div>“how can we reinforce (or even create) a sense of national consciousness and foster a deeper awareness of our social solidarity as a new nation?”</div></blockquote>

<p>Certainly such people, including those from the South Sudan, do not need to be forced to have something like the new Guide promise! They need the old one. They need loyalty to their country before loyalty to their tribal, army or regional communities, or “communities that take the law into their own hands”.<br><br><br></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Girlguiding, The New Promise, The General Synod, Pragmatics and Confusion">(March 2014) Girlguiding, The New Promise, The General Synod, Pragmatics and Confusion</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2014</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>History</b><br><br>On 1 September 2013 a new Promise was enforced on Girlguiding UK. It said: </p>

<blockquote><div>I promise that I will do my best: To be true to myself and develop my beliefs  [instead of love my God]; To serve the Queen and my community [instead of country]; To help other people, and To keep the (Brownie) Guide Law.</div></blockquote>

<p>The Jesmond Parish Church October 2013 <i>Coloured Supplement</i> on <i>The Religion of the Self</i> explained why this promise was unacceptable (as did the February 2014 edition dealing with “community” for “country”). On 30 October Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali convened a small meeting in London at which among others Mrs Glynis Mackie (leader of our JPC 37th Newcastle Guide Unit and known in the UK for her refusal to use the new promise), Mrs Alison Ruoff (a magistrate and member of the General Synod of the Church of England) and myself were present.<br><br>On 9 December Miss Hilary Cooper, the Chief Commissioner Girlguiding North East England, sent me a letter (and I understand all our parents of our girls’ uniformed groups as well). This announced that unless our units used the new promise “we [<i>the Girlguiding hierarchy</i>] will have no choice but to remove the link between Girlguiding and Jesmond Parish Church as of 31 December 2013”. On 17 December I wrote to the Chief Guide that Hilary Cooper was demanding of our Church sponsored units something contrary to Guide law and Church of England law. I was grateful for the Chief Guide’s reply on 20 December 2013. But she seemed not to have understood my substantial point. The Chief Guide, then, no doubt received a shock (as I did – but a very happy one). For the following day, Saturday 21 December, a full centre page feature of the<i> Daily Mail </i>was about Glynis and the girls in her unit. It explained why Glynis is such a good leader and there seems always to be waiting lists for girls to join JPC guides. Following that article Glynis told me that the explusion date had been deferred to 19 January; and just before that date the ban seemed completely lifted. However, a meeting was required by Hilary Cooper to see if a way forward could be found.<br><b><br>31 January 2014<br></b><br>Hilary Cooper convened a meeting on 31 January in Jesmond at which, also present, were others of the hierarchy, our leaders, parents, Guides, Rangers and some church staff (I did not attend). In a subsequent letter to Glynis, Hilary Cooper wrote about her own contribution: “At the meeting I outlined a way forward for the Jesmond Guides to consider, namely the ‘framing’ of the Promise to set it in a context that we hoped would make it acceptable to members of the Jesmond Guiding community. By ‘framing’ I mean those who are struggling with the wording can provide the context of their belief if they wish, through use of a separate statement before making our Promise. The specific suggestions I made were, ‘In the presence of my God …’ or ‘On the understanding that I will always be true to my God’. These were only examples however and it would be a matter of personal choice. We know that this approach has already been happily adopted by some other members of Girlguiding. This is the way forward that we have offered. Girlguiding remains committed to one Promise for all and this suggested way forward is made with the expectation that our new Promise will be the only one used.”<br><br>Hilary Cooper’s notes of the meeting make it clear that these new words were new thoughts at the meeting and not generally acceptable as missing the problem “which is the displacing of ‘God’ and replacing it with ‘Self’”.<br><br>This letter detailing the 31 January meeting was sent on 12 February. It was after she had see that day’s edition of <i>The Daily Mail</i> with a headline <i>UK Girl Guide troop which refused to drop “God” from their oath win their fight after being threatened with closure.</i> The following article was about Glynis’ unit in particular and after there was no longer an ultimatum and the Girlguiding leadership seemed to be willing at least to talk about change. <br><br>However, Hilary Cooper’s letter to Glynis complained that this “article in today’s Daily Mail has resulted in inaccurate coverage.”<br><b><br>The General Synod Debate<br></b><br>The very next day, Wednesday 13 February, Alison Ruoff proposed a Private Member’s Motion in the General Synod of the Church of England on Girlguiding and the issues JPC Guides had raised nationally. The motion was:</p>

<blockquote><div>That this Synod believe that girls of all ages in the Girlguiding Movement should not suffer discrimination but be able to continue to promise to love God when enrolled rather than making a wholly secular promise.</div></blockquote>

<p>In the event, there was an amendment proposed by the Rev. Andrew Dotchin, a clergyman who spoke as “an ambassador for Girlguiding”, a recognized role in Girlguiding. His (confusing) amendment was:</p>

<blockquote><div>That this Synod: a) congratulates Girlguiding on its recent Centenary and applaud its work in helping girls and young women to take their place as full and responsible members of their communities; b) believes that girls and women of all ages should be able to continue to promise to love God when enrolled; and c) commends the suggestion that, when a member chooses so to do, the Promise may be prefaced with the phrase “in the presence of God I make my Guide Promise.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Andrew Dotchin said that this amendment, if passed, would state the Synod’s belief that “girls and women of all ages in the Girlguiding movement should be able to continue to promise to love God when enrolled, and suggests that a member could choose to preface the promise with the phrase: ‘In the presence of God I make my Guide Promise …’” His amendment was carried by 164 <i>in favour</i> and 154<i> against</i> with 15 <i>absentions</i>. So the following day, 14 February, the newspapers were read as saying the Girlguiding authorities were allowing the old promise to be said. After all Mr Dotchin was an ambassador for Girlguiding and he had supported the idea that girls and women should be allowed to do that. (It is probable many voted for the amendment on that basis; others may have suspected that this was not necessarily the case and voted against it.)<br><b><br>The Chief Guide’s letter to <i>The Times</i><br></b><br>The following week on Tuesday 18 February, presumably after the Girlguiding hierarchy had taken stock, the following letter appeared in <i>The Times</i> from the Chief Guide under the heading <i>Girlguiding</i>: “Sir, The Church of England General Synod has just debated Girlguiding’s Promise (Feb 13). Before we changed the Promise, we heard that many girls struggled with it and said it was often a barrier to joining our charity. Our trustees took this very seriously. Being open to all girls is one of our most deeply held commitments. I was immensely proud of the care our volunteers invested in forming the Promise with its pledge to actively ‘develop my beliefs’ and ‘be true to myself’. People have told me this wording demands meaningful thought about beliefs and values. Of course, with over half a million members it was inevitable not everyone would be happy. A few members have told us that as part of their Promise celebrations they chose to say words before making our Promise that made clear what their personal beliefs are. This seemed no problem to us. And it was heartening to see Synod commended this pragmatic approach. But I would like to be clear that none of this changes the decisions that came out of our careful consultation last year. We are absolutely clear that the words of the Promise, and our commitment to one Promise for All, have not changed. <i>Chief Guide Gill Slocombe”</i><br><br>I felt this needed a response and so submitted the following to <i>The Times</i>: “Sir, The Chief Guide in her defence of only allowing ‘one Promise for All’, namely ‘to be true to myself’ (Feb 18), did not mention the Church of England General Synod’s vote ‘that girls and women of all ages in the Girlguiding Movement should be able to continue to promise to love God when enrolled.’ Surely the suggested ‘pragmatic approach’ of allowing a statement of personal beliefs makes a nonsense of the new promise when a Guide states she believes it wrong and misleading! Also the Chief Guide did not mention a Feb 4 letter from the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and referred to in the Synod. This drew attention to the Guide Association's governing Royal Charter whose Bye Law 24 requires commitment to the ‘Fundamental Principles’ of the World Association of Girl Guides. Article 2 of these says: ‘The Fundamental Principles of the World Association are those of the Girl Guide/Girl Scout Movement as expressed in the Original Promise and Law, laid down by the Founder –<i>Original Promise</i>: “On my honour, I promise that I will do my best to do my duty to God and the king [or God and my country]”.’<i> Rev David Holloway</i>” This was not published. The confusion and the debate continues.<br><b><br>A biblical response<br></b><br>The words of St. Paul in the Bible come to mind: </p>

<blockquote><div>“let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up” (Galatians 6.9).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Lent, Commination and The Cross">(April 2014) Lent, Commination and The Cross</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2014</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>Fundamental Doctrine</b><br><br>The Good Friday song by Townend and Getty, <i>“Oh, to see the dawn, of the darkest day”</i> (that many find helpful), goes on like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Christ on the road to Calvary. | Tried by sinful men, | Torn and beaten, then | Nailed to a cross of wood. | This, the power of the cross: | Christ became sin for us, | Took the blame, bore the wrath – | We stand forgiven at the cross.”  Keith Getty &amp; Stuart Townend © 2005 Thankyou Music CCL 2054</div></blockquote>

<p>Some cannot believe that there is such a thing as “God’s wrath” or an objective reality to the word “hell” (see <i>Coloured Supplement</i> September 2013 for criticism of another Townend and Getty song where it says, “the wrath of God is satisfied”). However, the Church of England is committed to believing that God’s wrath and the reality of God’s judgement on sin is real. It is essential to understanding the love of God as seen in Christ bearing our sin, in our place on the Cross that first Good Friday. For the opposite of God’s wrath is not God’s love but God’s neutrality to sin (and death, disease and moral and spiritual darkness that result from sin). But God is a God of life and love who wants human flourishing and “blessing”. To this end there is in the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> a service called a “Commination – or denouncing of God’s anger and judgements against sinners” (<i>minor</i> Latin for “threaten”). The <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, it must be noted, is one of the historic standards for Anglican theology and doctrine; and Anglican clergy are to teach this doctrine. So as this Commination Service is “to be used on the first day of Lent, and at other times”, may I suggest that we consider carefully its teaching as we think of Christ’s death at this time of year.<br><b><br>Deuteronomy 27<br></b><br>The Commination service is seeking to counter charges of cheap grace or the idea that genuine faith and repentance is compatible with a life lived in defiance of God’s will and word. This is obviously something to be remembered when in March 2014 the “Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act” came into force, an Act that celebrates and promotes what God clearly says is sinful. Indeed, this service is to remind you that you cannot just act as you like without negative consequences. But as one Prayer Book commentator points out, the service is not only “to awaken the sense of guilt … at the same time [<i>it is</i>] to declare the glorious Gospel of the grace of God.” Nevertheless, the service starts with high-lighting some of the curses you read about in Deuternomy 27:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Cursed be the man who makes a carved or cast-metal image, an abomination to the LORD, and sets it up in secret. Cursed be anyone who dishonours his father or his mother. Cursed be anyone who moves his neighbour's landmark. Cursed be anyone who misleads a blind man on the road. Cursed be anyone who perverts the justice due to the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow. Cursed be anyone who lies with his father's wife. Cursed be anyone who strikes down his neighbour in secret. Cursed be anyone who takes a bribe to shed innocent blood (ESV translation).”</div></blockquote>

<p>And summarizing some of the others “curses” of Deuteronomy 27, it concludes: “Cursed are the unmerciful, fornicators and adulterers, covetous persons, idolaters, slanderers, drunkards and extortioners.” This list of sins is not exhaustive but representative. At any rate, the congregation is to say “Amen” to each of the curses, not as cursing other people, but as admitting that such activity is cursed in God’s sight and as a warning to ourselves.<br><b><br>Cranmer’s biblical homily<br></b><br>Then the Minister reads a sermonette made up of a collection of biblical truths. Here it is in Cranmer’s (ancient) version:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Now seeing that all they are accursed (as the prophet David beareth witness) who do err and go astray from the commandments of God; let us (remembering the dreadful judgement hanging over our heads, and always ready to fall upon us) return unto our Lord God with all contrition and meekness of heart; bewailing and lamenting our sinful life, acknowledging and confessing our offences, and seeking to bring forth worthy fruits of penance. For now is the axe put unto the root of the trees, so that every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: He shall pour down rain upon the sinners, snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest; this shall be their portion to drink. For lo, the Lord is come out of his place to visit the wickedness of such as dwell upon the earth. But who may abide the day of his coming? Who shall be able to endure when he appeareth? His fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. The day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night: and when men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape. Then shall appear the wrath of God in the day of vengeance, which obstinate sinners, through the stubbornness of their heart, have heaped unto themselves; which despised the goodness, patience, and long-sufferance of God, when he calleth them continually to repentance. Then shall they call upon me (saith the Lord) but I will not hear; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me; and that, because they hated knowledge, and received not the fear of the Lord, but abhorred my counsel, and despised my correction. Then shall it be too late to knock, when the door shall be shut; and too late to cry for mercy, when it is the time of justice. O terrible voice of most just judgement, which shall be pronounced upon them, when it shall be said unto them, Go, ye cursed, into the fire everlasting, which is prepared for the devil and his angels. Therefore, brethren, take we heed betime, while the day of salvation lasteth; for the night cometh, when none can work: But let us, while we have the light, believe in the light, and walk as children of the light; that we be not cast into utter darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Let us not abuse the goodness of God, who calleth us mercifully to amendment, and of his endless pity promiseth us forgiveness of that which is past, if with a perfect and true heart we return unto him. For though our sins be as red as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow; and though they be like purple, yet they shall be made white as wool. Turn ye (saith the Lord) from all your wickedness, and your sin shall not be your destruction: Cast away from you all your ungodliness that ye have done: Make you new hearts, and a new spirit: Wherefore will ye die, O ye house of Israel? seeing that I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God. Turn ye then, and ye shall live. Although we have sinned, yet have we an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins. For he was wounded for our offences, and smitten for our wickedness. Let us therefore return unto him, who is the merciful receiver of all true penitent sinners; assuring ourselves that he is ready to receive us, and most willing to pardon us, if we come unto him with faithful repentance; if we submit ourselves unto him, and from henceforth walk in his ways; if we will take his easy yoke and light burden upon us, to follow him in lowliness, patience, and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his Holy Spirit; seeking always his glory, and serving him duly in our vocation with thanksgiving. This if we do, Christ will deliver us from the curse of the law, and from the extreme malediction which shall light upon them that shall be set on the left hand; and he will set us on his right hand, and give us the gracious benediction of his Father, commanding us to take possession of his glorious kingdom: Unto which he vouchsafe to bring us all, for his infinite mercy. Amen.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>Then the great penitential Psalm 51 is read, “A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba”. And the service concludes with the minister praying as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>“O most mighty God, and merciful Father, who hast compassion upon all men, and hatest nothing that thou hast made; who wouldest not the death of a sinner, but that he should rather turn from his sin, and be saved: mercifully forgive us our trespasses; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the burden of our sins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it appertaineth to forgive sins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed; enter not into judgement with thy servants, who are vile earth, and miserable sinners; but so turn thine anger from us, who meekly acknowledge our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults, and so make haste to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”</div></blockquote>

<p>Then all join in with this final prayer:</p>

<blockquote><div>“Turn thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned. Be favourable, O Lord, be favourable to thy people, who turn to thee in weeping, fasting, and praying. For thou art a merciful God, full of compassion, long-suffering, and of great pity. Thou sparest when we deserve punishment, and in thy wrath thinkest upon mercy. Spare thy people, good Lord, spare them, and let not thine heritage be brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, and after the multitude of thy mercies look upon us; through the merits and mediation of thy blessed Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="'Confusion worse confounded."">(May 2014) "Confusion worse confounded."</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2014</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                
                <p><b>The South Sudan</b><br><br>The situation in the South Sudan is still unstable. At the time of writing (at the end of April) John Inglis-Jones, Executive Officer of AID (Anglican International Development), is visiting the country and the AID staff working there. He will report back at the beginning of May. The good news is that plans are under way for the ICMDA (International Christian Medical and Dental Association) to start training Sudanese nationals as Clinical Officers ( = UK Nurse Practitioners) in Uganda and AID is making funds available to help. The Institute of Health Sciences being planned for Bor in Jonglei State is necessarily on hold for the moment, as Bor recovers from the terrible violence and destruction it has recently suffered. This Ugandan plan, therefore, is a temporary arrangement. Certainly millions of innocent and helpless people in the South Sudan need medical and other help more than ever. Those of us involved in AID are asking people to pray and still to give for all the work that is able to continue, and not least for training new Clinical Officers. But there have been other reports from, and about, the South Sudan and other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa during April and involving the West. These recall to mind famous words of John Milton. In Book 2 of <i>Paradise Lost</i> he describes the fall of evil angels and their expulsion from heaven as “with ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, <i>confusion worse confounded.”</i><br><br><b>The Archbishop of Canterbury and the <i>Church Times</i></b><br><br>On 11 April 2014 the <i>Church Times</i> had the following report:</p>

<blockquote><div>Bishops in South Sudan have confirmed the Archbishop of Canterbury’s warning that Christians in the country face a violent reaction if the Church of England permits same-sex marriage and blessings. Archbishop Welby gave his warning during a phone-in on LBC radio last Friday. Asked why the Church of England could not permit clergy to bless same-sex relationships, he said: “The impact of that on Christians in countries far from here, like South Sudan, like Nigeria, and other places would be absolutely catastrophic.” He spoke of a visit to South Sudan in January: “The church leaders there were saying, please don't change what you’re doing because then we couldn't accept your help, and we need your help desperately.” The LBC presenter, James O'Brien suggested that gay Christians might interpret the Archbishop’s words as a ban on marrying “because of ... some, dare we say, less enlightened people in Africa.” “I don't think we can say ‘less enlightened’, actually,” replied the Archbishop. “That's nothing to do with it. It's about the fact that I stood by a graveside in Africa of a group of Christians who'd been attacked because of something that had happened far, far away in America.” Returning to the subject later, he said: “what was said [by their opponents] was that ‘if we leave the Christian community in this area’ - I am quoting them – ‘we will all be made to become homosexuals; so we are going to kill the Christians.’ The mass grave had 369 bodies in it, and I was standing with the relatives. That burns itself into your soul - as does the suffering of gay people in this country.”On Tuesday, the Bishop of Maridi [in South Sudan], the Rt. Revd Justin Badi Arama, verified this report. “Gay relationships in the Church of England would mean the people of South Sudan going back to their traditional religions which do not take them to same-sex practice,” he said. “Secondly, there would be continued violence against Christians [in the fear] that they would bring bad and shameful behaviour or homosexual practice, and spread it in the communities.” Any change would lead to a risk, the Bishop of Wau, the Rt. Revd Moses Deng Bol, warned on Wednesday. “The Church of England blessing gay marriages will be dangerous for the Church in South Sudan, because people here, like many African countries, strongly oppose gay marriages. And so they would want the Church here to break relationship with the Church of England. As a Church, we need to remain united as a body of Christ. We must be mindful of our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world when taking decisions, because what affects one part of the body affects the whole body as well.” Bishop Arama concurred: “As South Sudanese, we very much value the partnership, and all the efforts of the Church of England to support the Church in Sudan during all the difficult moments in our history. Same-sex practice would distort this long history, because light and darkness cannot stay together. It is our prayer that the Church of England should not follow the world into darkness, but lead the world into light.”During the phone-in, the Archbishop reiterated a traditional position on same-sex relationships: “My position is the historic position of the Church, which is in our canons, which says that sexual relations should be within marriage, and marriage is between a man and a woman.” Asked whether he could imagine a day when two people of the same sex married in the Church of England, he said: “I look at the Scriptures, I look at the teaching of the Church, I listen to Christians round the world, and I have real hesitations about that. I am incredibly uncomfortable about saying that. I really don't want to say, "No," to people who love each other, but you have to have a sense of following what the teaching of the Church is. We can't just make sudden changes.”</div></blockquote>

<p><b>The British High Commissioner to Kenya and the Kenyan <i>Star</i></b><br><br>A second important report was two days earlier, on Wednesday 9 April 2014, and in the <i>Star</i> newspaper of Kenya. It was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Anglican Church of Kenya [ACK] Archbishop, Reverend Eliud Wabukala, has said the institution of marriage is under attack from both foreign and local forces. In a statement, Rev Wabukala said marriage is under attack from outside the country with the West, and sections of the Anglican Church, pressuring the ACK to treat homosexuality as a human right. Wabukala stated that “this is to cheapen rights so that they become a demand that we tolerate individual preferences that are destructive of our moral fabric.” He further termed same sex marriage (which recently became legal in England), and homosexuality, as an attack on human identity as male and female created in the image of God. “To use the law of the land to legislate for an activity which is against the natural order, and consistently described as sinful in the Scriptures, is a very serious step which strikes at the heart of family life. It is a repudiation of God and his Word which should make us tremble and cry out for his mercy,” Wabukala added. He said within Kenya marriage is under attack following recent amendments to the Marriage Bill by Members of Parliament recognizing polygamy. “I have to say that the proposal agreed by a majority of Members of Parliament to recognise in law the right of men to have as many wives as they like was cowardly and will be a backward step for Kenya, if it becomes law. It is true that this legislation would not apply to Christian marriages; but we cannot stay quiet when we see the place of women in our society being demeaned. God’s pattern is given for us in one man and one woman (Adam and Eve before the fall) and is reaffirmed in the New Testament, where we see marriage used as a picture of the love of Christ for his bride, the Church,” Wabukala said. He further urged Kenyans to ensure that our laws are Godly, promoting justice and righteousness.”</div></blockquote>

<p>However, immediately after that report in the <i>Star</i> newspaper we heard, through a reliable source, that the British High Commissioner to Kenya went to see Archbishop Wabukala to protest about this statement about marriage made in All Saints Cathedral on Sunday 30 March (the day following the legalization of Gay Marriage in England). “What is particularly disturbing,” we were told, “is that the High Commissioner issued a direct threat to the Archbishop that his statement could jeopardise UK government aid to Kenya.” Nor was such a threat for the first time. The previous High Commissioner made a similar one in 2011. This UK attempt “to use financial muscle to try and intimidate an overseas Archbishop in this way is outrageous. Fifty years after independence, it looks as if the UK government still thinks it can bend Kenyan leaders to its will, even spiritual leaders,” it was said. Such an attempt “to interfere with the voice and the conscience of the Church is completely unacceptable.”<br><b><br>Geopolitics<br></b><br>The folly of such British Government policy is two fold. One, it will drive more and more Africans to support extremist positions on homosexual relationships, especially those of radical Muslim groups. It will generate recruits for such violent Islamic terrorists in Kenya as Al-Shabaab, and in Nigeria as Boko Haram. Christians, of course, hold the middle ground between such murderous extremists, on the one hand, and such<i> illiberal</i> sexualized Westerners, on the other hand. While condemning all sexual activity outside marriage, Christians believe not in execution but forgiveness through Christ, then echo his words, “Go, and from now on sin no more” (John 8.11). <br><br>Two, the policy is folly for it surrenders global moral leadership to President Putin. In February Russia stopped same-sex couples adopting. Last year saw a new law banning “propaganda promoting non-traditional sexual relations” seen by minors. A bill is in process to prevent “non-traditional” relationships from contracting with surrogate mothers. The American, R.R.Reno writes: </p>

<blockquote><div>Commentators ascribe this moralism to domestic Russian politics, arguing that Putin is shoring up his conservative base of support. No doubt that’s true, but that’s not the whole story. Putin is thinking internationally as well, positioning Russia to lead an anti-Western coalition along moral as well as geopolitical lines. In a speech last December, he pledged to defend “family values” and reject moral relativism, pointedly observing that this message appeals to “more and more people across the world who support our position.”</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="God's Guidance and Our Decision-Making">(August 2014) God's Guidance and Our Decision-Making</h2><ul><li>Ian Garrett</li><li>August 2014</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p>I preached recently on a passage with a lot of application to the area of 'guidance' (which is Christian shorthand for 'how we make decisions with reference to God'). And various people said it clarified for them a topic about which they'd heard different – and confusing – things. So here's a summary of a seminar I've often given on 'Guidance and decision-making'.</p>
<p><strong>A wrong view of guidance</strong></p>
<p>One view of guidance says this: 'God has a specific plan for your life and<em> in advance</em> of every 'fork in the road' (eg, 'Do I apply to this university or that one?', 'Do we buy this house or that one?'), you have to discover that specific plan, in order to make the right choice.' Now the obvious problem with that view is: <em>how</em> do you discover God's specific plan for you? After all, there are no verses in the Bible linking you specifically with any university or house (or job or boy- or girl-friend, etc). To which people say things like, 'Well, God will give you peace about the right way,' or, 'You'll feel led (or 'called'),' or, 'You'll just know'. But that all becomes hopelessly subjective, and highlights where that view of guidance goes wrong. What's right with it is that God <em>does</em> have a specific plan for each of our lives (Ephesians 1.11 says things happen 'according to the plan of him who works out <em>everything</em> in conformity with the purpose of his will'). But what's wrong with that view of guidance is the idea that we can discover God's specific plan for our lives <em>in advance</em> of making decisions – when the truth is: we can't. We only discover God's specific plan for our lives in retrospect. So, for example, I <em>now</em> know that it's part of God's specific plan for me to be married to Tess – because I'm married to Tess. But I didn't know that eight years ago when we were still just going out (in fact, I didn't know it until about 1.20pm on 24th February 2007, after we'd made our vows).</p>
<p><strong>The right view of guidance</strong></p>
<p>So, what's the right view? It says, 'God <em>does</em> have a specific plan for our lives – but we <em>can't</em> discover it in advance of making decisions, because he <em>hasn't</em> revealed it to us in the Bible. So our responsibility is to understand what he <em>has</em> revealed in the Bible – his '<em>general</em> plan' – and then to make our decisions in line with that.' And, to summarise the whole Bible, God's plan is: to bring a people back into relationship with him, who live (imperfectly) for Jesus as King in this life, and who will join him (finally made perfect) in his kingdom beyond this life. And that plan is being worked out as people hear the gospel and are forgiven back into relationship with him through Jesus' death on the cross. So knowing God's general plan tells us the two goals or priorities that should govern our decision-making –<em> they're gospel ministry and godliness:</em></p>
<p>•<em> Gospel ministry</em> – that's playing our part in the spread of the gospel and the building up of the church (which is how God takes his plan forward); and<br>• <em>Godliness –</em> that's living godly lives, living as wholly as we can for Jesus as King – which is what the whole plan is aiming for.</p>
<p>One way of picturing all this is to think of life as a game of football. In what he <em>has</em> revealed to us in the Bible, God has done two things to guide us:</p>
<p>• He has marked out <em>the boundaries</em> of the pitch – the 'moral touchline' or right-versus-wrong line within which we must play. For example, there's the bit of the 'touchline' that says, 'You shall not steal' (Exodus 20.15).<br>• He has also shown us <em>the goal</em> we're aiming for – the twin goal of gospel ministry and godliness – so we know that everything we do on the pitch should be moving towards that goal.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to guidance, we face two types of question. There are 'type 1 questions' like, 'Shall I be a bank robber?' And those are 'moral touchline' questions, right-versus-wrong questions. And the Bible answers those questions, it decides the issue for you, and you can be 100% certain before you act what God wants you to do (don't be a bank robber, in case you're in doubt).</p>
<p>But then there are 'type 2 questions' like, 'As a maths graduate, shall I go into accountancy or teaching?' And there the 'moral touchlines' don't help you, because <em>both</em> accountancy and teaching are right – they're both permissible positions in which a Christian may play on the pitch. So this time you're not facing a right-versus-wrong decision, but a permissible-versus-permissible decision. So how do you decide? The answer is: you have to ask, 'What's <em>best</em> for my gospel ministry and godliness?' Which is why some people have labelled these type 2 questions 'wisdom decisions'. Because whereas with type 1 questions, we simply need <em>obedience</em> to do what the Bible tells us to, with type 2 questions we need <em>wisdom</em> to see which of the options facing us will be best for those twin goals in God's plan. So with 'type 2 questions', the Bible doesn't answer the question for you, it <em>doesn't</em> decide for you – you have to make a decision, and you have to make it with less than (often far less than) 100% certainty.</p>
<p>Now, getting the right view of guidance doesn't instantly solve all our guidance problems: making decisions – especially 'big' decisions – isn't easy. But the wrong view of guidance with which we began causes people great and unnecessary problems. For example, I've come across Christians agonising and fearful about making the 'wrong' decision when in fact they're trying to choose between options that are both perfectly permissible and right (like accountancy versus teaching). And it's been such a relief to them to discover that it's not a right-versus-wrong decision, but a wisdom decision – a matter of trying to see what's best from God's point of view, and going for that. Another problem caused by the wrong view of guidance is Christians who think that they've missed God's 'Plan A' for their lives through making a wrong decision, and that they're now permanently stuck with 'Plan B' – for example, the person who thinks, 'Maybe God meant me to choose teaching instead of accountancy, but all these years I've been on the wrong path.' And they need reassuring that what God meant them to do was to try to make a <em>wise</em> choice (after all, with 'type 2 questions', he doesn't reveal in advance what we 'ought' to choose) and that the choice they made was part of his plan. And that even applies to unwise or even morally wrong choices we've made: God allows us the freedom to make such decisions – and yet they're all part of his plan.</p>
<p><strong>So how do we go about making decisions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. We need to trust the Lord and pray for wisdom:</strong> Proverbs 3.5-6 says: 'Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways, acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.' That means trusting the wisdom of what God has revealed in the Bible, rather than our own wisdom. So, for example, one thing he reveals is that he wants a believer, if he or she marries, only to marry another believer (1 Corinthians 7.39) – otherwise it will be a marriage pulling in fundamentally opposite directions: one for Jesus, one not. And we need to trust the wisdom of that when there's no potential Christian partner on the horizon. And we need to pray for wisdom (ie, the ability to see and the will to choose what's best for gospel ministry and godliness), as James 1.5-7 says: 'If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.' The point of those verses is that when we pray for wisdom, we must be single-mindedly willing to go where wisdom clearly leads, rather than be 'double-minded' and not go where it clearly leads. So for example, some of us are already thinking and praying about involvement in our future new ministry at St Joseph's Benwell. What if, as some of us do that, it seems clearer and clearer that the best thing for gospel ministry is actually to move to that area of town? James's point is that we're being double-minded when we do reach a settled conclusion about what's best, but we don't go for it for whatever reasons (the hassle of moving, the uncertainty of schooling for my children, etc).</p>
<p><strong>2. We need to find out what the Bible says that bears on the decision.</strong> We need to ask, 'What are the right-versus-wrong lines within which we must decide?' and 'What wisdom does the Bible give for choosing between things that are both permissible and right?' For example, take the area of considering going out and marriage. The right-versus-wrong lines in the Bible are clear: if I marry, God wants me to marry 1) someone of the opposite sex who is 2) a fellow-believer and 3) not already married (and Jesus taught that those who have divorced remain married in God's sight, while both partners live). But the Bible also gives us wisdom to see what's best within those lines. Eg, it says that if I'm presently single and managing singleness OK and not feeling under any pressure to seek marriage, it's best to remain single for now and make the most of the advantages of more undivided time and energy for growth in gospel ministry and godliness (1 Corinthians 7.32-35). On the other hand, if I'm definitely wanting to seek marriage, it gives wisdom about looking for a partner – for example, 'Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.' (Proverbs 31.31)</p>
<p><strong>3. We need to consult other sources of wisdom, too.</strong> That includes other people and our own experience and accumulated wisdom. 'Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.' (Proverbs 15.22)</p>
<p><strong>4. We need to make a wise decision</strong>. Remember, for 'type 2 questions' we're <em>not</em> making 'right-versus-wrong decisions <em>but</em> 'wise-versus-unwise' decisions. And a wise decision is one that, as far as we can see, is best for our gospel ministry and godliness. And apart from some exceptional guidance through things like visions (Acts 16.6-10), that's how the apostle Paul made his decisions. For example, he wrote to the Thessalonians, 'So… <em>we thought it best</em> to be left by ourselves in Athens. We sent Timothy… to strengthen and encourage you…' (1 Thessalonians 3.1-2) And that's why Paul wrote to the Philippians, 'And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you <em>may be able to discern what is best</em>…' (Philippians 1.9-10). And that's a great prayer whenever we're thinking through a decision: 'Lord, help me to discern what is best here for serving your purposes – for gospel ministry and godliness.' So, for example, one Christian I know was originally a drugs rep, which involved lots of travel, staying away overnight in hotels. And that didn't help his godliness because of temptations for him and being absent from family. And nor did it help his gospel ministry because the job gave no real continuity of relationships for sharing his faith – and left him little time to be involved in church. So for those reasons, he re-trained and became a school-teacher just round the corner from home – a good example of making a wise decision. It's important to add two things: one is that sometimes, it's just not clear that one of two good options is really better – in which case, it comes down to our own inclination and preference (for example, would I rather live in this road or that one?). The other thing is to emphasise again that we have to make a decision. So, for example, I was talking to a Christian friend about his long-term girlfriend and asking him what he was thinking about the future. And he said, 'I'm still asking myself the question, 'What does God want here?' – and I'm still not sure.' To which I said, 'That's the wrong question. The question is, 'What do <em>you</em> want here?' – and what God wants is for you to make a decision about that.' (See 1 Corinthians 7.36.)</p>
<p><strong>5. We need to submit the decision to God's sovereignty.</strong> God's sovereignty is his total control over all things. So God is s<em>overeign over the person you are</em> – over the person he made you (with the gifts, IQ, personality, looks, etc, which you've got) and he's sovereign over the things which have shaped you in life (your family, education, influences, difficulties, set-backs, etc). And that means (contrary to the message we often get from the culture and the education system) we <em>can't</em> do anything we want, so long as we work hard enough – the world is not 'our oyster', with endless options open to us. And God is <em>also sovereign over the opening and closing of doors of opportunity</em> – for example, sovereign over exam results, sovereign over school or university places, sovereign over the job market, sovereign over whether they call you for interview, sovereign over what they decide after the interview. So, while we're trying to make a decision, we should pray for wisdom to see and choose what's best; and once we've made a decision, we should pray, 'Lord, please only let this go ahead if it's your will, if it really is the best thing.' (See James 4.13-15.) And the great reassurance is that, because God is sovereign, he can keep shut any door we push, if he knows it's not going to be good for us.</p>
<p><strong>6. Living after a decision.</strong> You may do all of the above, make a wise decision and then still feel anxious and far less than sure. Well, as we've seen, with 'type 2 questions', you can <em>never</em> be 100% sure. When I said 'Yes' to the offer of a post at JPC (having originally said 'No'!), I <em>felt</em> about 51% sure – life is like that sometimes. The thing to do then is to keep trusting that God was sovereign over the decision, that he allowed you to make it as you tried your best to be wise, and that he can bless you and use you where you now are. I don't think I was sure in a settled way about being at JPC for several years after I arrived – but had to trust and wait for that to become clear.</p>
<p>But what if you encounter real difficulty as a result of a decision? For example, a friend of mine accepted the headship of a school with a Christian foundation, only to run into huge opposition to his attempts to revive properly Christian assemblies, school services and so on. And he undoubtedly wondered whether he'd made an unwise decision. But encountering difficulty as a result of a decision does <em>not</em> at all necessarily mean it was an unwise (or even wrong) decision. Just think of Nehemiah: his decision to lead the re-building of Jerusalem was absolutely in line with God's plan – but he faced difficulty and opposition every step of the way.</p>
<p>But, finally, what if we're clear that we <em>have</em> made either an unwise or a wrong decision? Well, Romans 8.28-30 says, 'And we know that in <em>all</em> things, God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined he also called; those he called he also justified; those he justified he also glorified.' That's a reminder that God is sovereign over <em>everything:</em> we <em>never</em> step outside his plan for us, which <em>includes</em> our sins and unwise decisions. And he allows those sins and unwise decisions because (for example, as they humble us and make us more dependent on him) they are all part of his process of making us more 'conformed to the likeness of his Son'. Now if we've made an <em>unwise</em> decision, we need to trust and obey God where we now are – and learn to be wiser in future (which <em>might</em> mean 'unpicking' the decision, if it's reversible). On the other hand, if we've made a <em>sinful</em> decision, we need to acknowledge and confess that to God, and start seeking to trust and obey him again, from where we now are (which, again, <em>might</em> mean 'unpicking' the decision, if it's reversible). But it might not be reversible: for example, one Christian I know married someone who's not a Christian – knowing that was not God's will as revealed in the Bible. And she said to me, 'My Christian life went nowhere after that – <em>until</em> I admitted to myself and to God that the step I'd taken was wrong, and asked his forgiveness, and set myself to start living for him again.' She understood that, now she was married to her husband, it was God's plan for her to be married and stay married to him. But she had to acknowledge and confess that the <em>step</em> of marrying him had been wrong – and only by doing that did her Christian life get going again.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The West, Europe and The UK - What Should We Do?">(September 2014) The West, Europe and The UK - What Should We Do?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2014</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>At such a time as this, what should Christian people be doing who are members of a national church like the Church of England, and in particular, what should their leaders be doing - in the West, and so for us in Europe and the UK?</p>
<p>Having had the privilege of a sabbatical over recent months, I have been able to visit a good number of different churches and meet Christian people in England, Scotland and the United States of America. I have also had the opportunity of meeting church leaders from around the wider world through my involvement in Anglican International Development (AID) and other networks. In addition I have had a greater opportunity for reading and study. From these meetings and this study it is clear that the Western world, and especially Europe, is at a critical point in its history. Unless facts are faced and there is change, the future, I believe, could be very dark. So what is needed is for the light of Christ to be shining brightly in the West and in Europe once again.</p>
<p><strong>The Death of Europe?</strong></p>
<p>In an article in 2009, entitled <em>While Europe Slept</em>, Jean Bethke Elshtain, the Christian political philosopher, was commenting on Europe's reluctance to have God in its constitution or a reference to its Christian heritage. But at the same time it was willing to refer to the heritage of Greece and Rome along with the secular European Enlightenment. These were her words:</p>
<blockquote><div>If Europe abandons her religious heritage, the idea of Europe dies. <em>And Europe has abandoned, or forgotten, her religious heritage.</em> Europe is now 'post-Christian'. What does this mean? What does it portend? If a culture forgets what it is, as I believe Europe has done, it falls first into an agnostic shrugging of the shoulders, unable to say exactly what it is and believes, and from there it will inevitably fall into nihilism. Detached from its religious foundations, Europe will not remain agnostic. The first result is manifest in those ideologies of multiculturalism that make 'difference' a kind of sacred, absolute principle, <em>although no principle is considered to have any such status.</em> Difference tells us nothing in and of itself. Some ways of life and ways of being in the world are brutal, stupid, and ugly. Some a human rights-oriented culture cannot tolerate … A culture must believe in its own enculturating responsibility and mission in order to make claims of value and to institutionalise them in social and political forms. This a post-Christian Europe cannot do" (italics mine).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The European Elections</strong></p>
<p>But is all lost? The European elections, earlier in the summer, provided a glimmer of hope. The results around Europe were evidence that significant numbers are not happy with current politics in the West. Certainly some want someone, somewhere, to address the moral and spiritual confusion that currently marks secular Western politics. Also what is wanted is for Europe's problems to be properly and openly faced and discussed publicly and fairly. They do not want these problems ignored, fudged or evaded by the use of politically correct meaningless jargon as too often happens. In those European elections in the UK, the surprising victories of UKIP (the UK Independence Party) gave rise to some serious soul searching. So what was the response?</p>
<p>The reaction on the BBC <em>Today</em> programme, the morning following the elections, was interesting. First, there was Chuka Umunna, the Labour Shadow Secretary of State for Businness, Innovation and Skills. He said the problem UKIP was highlighting was the "economic and political system". This needed to be addressed. But he added that fundamental values must not be traded away – the values of "tolerance and mutual respect". Then came David Cameron, the Tory Prime Minister. He said that these UKIP polling victories were due to people's "disillusionment with Europe". For they wanted "change". They wanted to return power to member states. He argued that UKIP was simply a "free hit". It was just "sending a message" on Europe. So he would ensure, if re-elected for a second term, a Referendum for 2017 "after [European] renegotiation".</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>What, however, was absent from all the discussion about those elections, that I heard (or read), was any mention of moral or spiritual issues. Yet these are so fundamental to any society. Without the moral or spiritual dimension, and the traditional Christian understanding of public life, any new "economic and political system" of Chuka Umunna or David Cameron's seeking to return power to member states will lead to further disillusionment.</p>
<p>"Change", of course, is necessary, as are "tolerance" and "mutual respect". But most certainly they are not sufficient for social cohesion or to ground economics or politics. "Tolerance", unless defined in terms of what is to be tolerated, is vacuous and meaningless. By definition, you can only tolerate what you think is wrong. Tolerance presupposes a moral order. Similarly "respect" tells you nothing. Yes, respect should be paid to every human being. But how individual respected human beings should then be honoured, esteemed or evaluated is a very different matter. Sadly a post-Christian world does not know the answer to that. It is not equipped to make those assessments, having turned its back on such God-ordained standards as the Ten Commandments, Christ's Sermon on the Mount and other ethics and virtues of the mainstream biblical Christian tradition. Furthermore, modern non-defined tolerance makes such esteeming, honouring or evaluation of other individuals illegitimate. But judgments are having to be made and UKIP, whatever one thinks of the party, has given these judgments publicity.</p>
<p><em><strong>"The Fourth Revolution"</strong></em></p>
<p>Some judgments appear in the recent book by John Micklethwaite (the Editor-in-Chief of <em>The Economist</em>) and Adrian Wooldridge (its Management Editor). It is entitled <em>The Fourth Revolution</em>, with the subtitle being "the global race to reinvent the state." Its argument is that there have been <em>three</em> significant political revolutions for the Western world. The <em>first</em> led to the creation of the nation-state in the 17th century when "European governments embraced the idea of rule based on law rather than on whim [of Kings]: 'n<em>on sub homine sed sub Deo et lege</em>' [not under man but under God and the law]." The second revolution led to the creation of the liberal state and modern democracy in the 19th century. The <em>third</em> led to the creation of the modern welfare state in the 20th century.</p>
<p>But, the authors argue, modern failures of liberal democratic and welfare states require a new <em>fourth</em> revolution. This would come about, on the one hand, by "reviving the spirit of liberty by putting more emphasis on individual rights and less on social rights." On the other hand, it would come about by "reviving the spirit of democracy by lightening the burden of the state" – that is to say, by having limited government.</p>
<p>Micklethwaite and Wooldridge believe that "the great problem of the West is not just that it has overloaded the state with obligations it cannot meet; it has overburdened democracy with expectations that cannot be fulfilled." They agree with the truth of Plato's two great criticisms of democracy "that voters would put short-term satisfaction above long-term prudence and that politicians would try to bribe their way to power – as they have done by promising entitlements that future generations will have to pay for. A narrower state, especially one that constrained itself by self-denying ordinances, would be a more sustainable one."</p>
<p><strong>The Moral and Spiritual Order</strong></p>
<p>But how do people become "self-denying", when "the self" has become a primary value in the West? The State cannot force anyone to be "self-denying", if liberty is still prized. Three things are to be remembered regarding what "the State" can or should do. <em>First,</em> "the state" is to be seen as the nation organized for the protection and good ordering of the life of its citizens and the one institution entitled to use force. <em>Secondly,</em> as P T Forsyth once said: "The State does not exist to make men good, the Church does. The State exists to secure the conditions of goodness, the Church to create the thing itself." People need the forgiveness and power of Christ to be good. And, <em>thirdly,</em> it was Gladstone, the 19th century Prime Minister, who said: "[the State] <em>is moral, and not merely economical</em>, inasmuch as its laws and institutions, and the acts done under them, are intimately connected with the formation of our moral habits, our modes of thought, and the state of our affections."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Christian believes that the State is as much God's creation as the Church. That is what the Bible (Romans 13.1ff) clearly teaches; and that is why the nation-state needs to be pictured as a three-legged stool with the legs being, one, the political order; two, the economic order; but, three (and vitally), the God-given moral and spiritual order. If one leg is missing or broken, the stool cannot stand up. All are necessary. Certainly without this moral and spiritual order nationally there will be considerable disarray – witness what is happening to the nations of the European Union. So it is unfortunate that for all the wisdom in <em>The Fourth Revolution</em> this moral and spiritual dimension is lacking.</p>
<p><strong>The Loss of the Moral and Spiritual Order</strong></p>
<p>The loss of the Christian faith and ethics in current political debate affects the survival chances of the European Enlightenment values of liberty, equality and fraternity, with their fruit being modern liberal democracy and the welfare state. So many still cherish those values and that democracy. But they require a theistic grounding - a belief in God - to survive. For liberty is rooted in God's freedom and his allowing us freely to reject him; equality comes from all equally being created in his image; and fraternity from all being by creation children (and a brotherhood) of one heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Similarly modern liberal democratic traditions and a viable welfare state will only survive where you have a Christian culture as the spiritual canopy and with strong Christian communities. Certainly modern democracies become illiberal without it – witness the so called "Arab Spring" where, for example, in Egypt democracy brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power, but then the newly elected majority led to greater repression of significant minorities, not least Christian minorities.</p>
<p><strong>The Family</strong></p>
<p>But the public crisis we are all facing is not just related to the general shape of our political life and the need "to reinvent the State" and to make it more fit for purpose. There are specific problems that must be addressed; and the supreme problem for the West currently is "the family".</p>
<p>Liberty and democracy demand strong families – with the norm being a married family of a father and mother producing and then caring for, and being responsible for, their children. The reason for this need is that for human flourishing the nation-state requires mediating structures between the individual and the State and other large institutions of public life (such as great businesses). And the primary mediating structure is the family. Besides the human family other mediating structures, of course, include the Church – the family or household of God. These and other mediating structures are absolutely vital for a liberal society. To quote Peter Berger and Richard Neuhaus from their classic study, <em>To Empower the People</em> with the subtitle "the role of mediating structures in public policy":</p>
<blockquote><div>without institutionally reliable processes of mediation, the political order becomes detached from the values and realities of individual life. Deprived of its moral foundation, the political order is 'delegitimated'. When that happens, the political order must be secured by coercion rather then by consent. And when that happens, democracy disappears. The attractiveness of totalitarianism – whether instituted under left-wing or right-wing banners – is that it overcomes the dichotomy of private and public existence by imposing on life one comprehensive meaning.</div></blockquote>
<p>So as the family and the church disintegrate or are progressively destroyed, unintentionally or intentionally, the State takes on more and more power. It embraces and regulates more and more of our social and individual lives. When the State does that and it takes over more and more of the family's and the church's roles, it becomes increasingly totalitarian and eventually employs the illiberal horrors that sinful men and women in power can devise.</p>
<p><strong>European Demographic Decline</strong></p>
<p>Thank God, Europe is at present spared those horrors. But the State in Europe is becoming totalitarian. Scotland's <em>Children and Young People (Scotland</em>) Act now empowers the State to appoint a "named person" for every child, other than its parents, to act as its guardian from birth to the age of 18. The sociologist, Dr Furedi, calls this Act, smuggled in on the grounds of family disintegration, "grotesque".</p>
<p>However, in Europe as a whole the family is not only disintegrating but also failing to reproduce itself. This generates a very great challenge. For the current average fertility rate of all European women is the lowest in the world at 1.6 children per woman (with 2.1 being the replacement level). So, unless there is change, we should expect that in our grandchildren's time many Europeans will want, and possibly achieve, an Islamic European establishment of Sharia law. This is because Europe needs over 1 million immigrants every year due to its population decline. In the UK (with a better fertility rate but still not at replacement level) according to the UK Office for Budget Responsibility we need over a quarter of a million immigrants each year over the next 50 years to keep debt (as a proportion of GDP) at its current level. But many of these immigrants are likely to come from predominantly poorer countries near to Europe, namely from North Africa and the Middle East which are predominantly Muslim countries. Not to allow such immigrants, when the population is declining, is economically suicidal. This is not so obvious initially. That is because such population decline through falling fertility takes time to be experienced. It comes once demographic momentum ceases - that is when the oldest generation with replacement levels of fertility dies off. Until that happens there is an illusion of well-being with the population still increasing until that transition. But even before that moment you have serious problems when elderly populations "bulge" and these elderly populations need to be supported by fewer and fewer younger people. Modern science in modern Europe can achieve some alleviation by robotics. It cannot, however, produce to order, in the laboratory, a 30-50 year old economically productive human individual.</p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>
<p>So what should Christian people be doing who are members of a national church like the Church of England, and in particular, what should their leaders be doing at such a time as this?</p>
<p>In 1984 Raymond Johnston, a former church-warden of Jesmond Parish Church, was able to publish a little book entitled <em>The Functions of a National Church.</em> It was the republication of three Advent Lectures delivered in Westminster Abbey in 1963 by Canon Max Warren and with a full introduction by Raymond Johnston himself. That introduction concluded with these words:</p>
<blockquote><div>Our immediate task as Anglicans is to address ourselves humbly but confidently to the tasks of a national church. We shall <em>pray</em> for the city, as Jeremiah urged (Jer 29.7). We shall <em>preach</em> repentance, both individual and corporate, recalling the ministry of John the Baptist, Jonah, and One greater than either of them. We shall urge both rulers and ruled that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</div></blockquote>
<p>The reproduced lectures that follow suggested that the duty of a national church towards the State is that it should be doing three other "P's" besides <em>Praying</em> and <em>Preaching.</em> They are <em>Prophesying, Purifying and Preparing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prophesying and Purifying</strong></p>
<p><em>Prophesying</em> involves so much. It certainly involves following the Old Testament prophets and challenging those in authority (and those under authority) when they act defiantly of God's clear will. And Max Warren encourages us to be vigilant in this respect over all matters dealing with education. But he emphasizes that prophesying should not just mean challenging abuses of power and making statements in times of crisis. It also should mean helping the State, if we are able, resolve any social problems in the light of the Bible's teaching. And he quotes Alec Vidler:</p>
<blockquote><div>A church to be worthy of the name however small a minority it may be in any given society, is charged with the responsibility of bearing testimony to God's will before Kings and rulers and the whole people. It must declare man's civic duties as well as his ecclesiastical duties. It must teach the law of God, as well as preach the gospel of God. It must denounce injustice and sin seeing wherever they are to be found, and call upon all men to repent and return unto the Lord their God by obeying his Law in their common life.</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Purifying</em> also involves so much. We today can see it certainly means being champions for sexual purity against the drift of the sexualized West, and not least the homosexualized West, and advocating heterosexual lifelong marriage and the fruitfulness of that relationship. We can also see there is need of a process of "purifying" in the electronic media. But Max Warren argues that it will also mean ensuring that the Church and the State act as God intended. As P T Forsyth puts it: "Both [Church and State] are divine agents for human perfection. But the one by way of law and its evolution, the other by way of conscience and its redemption … The state is an agent of the Kingdom of God, the Church is the Kingdom in the making." We must be teaching as Jesus taught, that we should "render to Caesar the things that are Ceasar's, and to God the things that are God's." So we must see that the State's role is honoured but not when it orders what God forbids or forbids what God orders. And that is why now we need a much "narrower" State. As Lord Beveridge, the architect of the Welfare State, wrote: "The state is or can be master of money, but in a free society it is master of very little else. The making of a good society depends not on the State but on the citizens acting individually or in free association with one another."</p>
<p><strong>Preparing</strong></p>
<p>Finally, <em>Preparing</em> involves preparing people for the four last things, of death, judgment, heaven and hell (subjects many clergy avoid but which secularists want to discuss, witness the inception of "Death Cafés" for talking about death).<br>However, Max Warren said in 1963 "preparing" involves helping the nation adjust to "the rapidly changing world situation". That is true today when secularism has blinded people to Christian ethics and extremist Muslims interpret a Koranic command for execution and crucifixion literally. So with an increasing Muslim presence in Europe we need to make clear how the Bible and common sense show that Muslims are right over their rejection of Western sexual decadence, but those who respond with violence are very wrong. Then Western States need to learn from the historic Christian liberal tradition following the 17th century civil wars. That is where the State grants freedom to to religion and philosophy including, of course, the freedom to change your beliefs; but it outlaws violence, sedition and sexual immorality.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="War, The Christian and ISIL">(October 2014) War, The Christian and ISIL</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2014</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Friday 26 September 2014</strong></p>
<p>On the last Friday in September (26 Sept) the House of Commons agreed to the motion proposed by David Cameron, the Prime Minister, permitting air-strikes in the following terms: "That this House condemns the barbaric acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing; recognises the clear threat ISIL poses to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the Government of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific request to the UK Government for such support; further recognises the threat ISIL poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage; acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the Government of Iraq including countries throughout the Middle East; further acknowledges the request of the Government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in Iraq; notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in Syria as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in Parliament; accordingly supports Her Majesty's Government, working with allies, in supporting the Government of Iraq in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces' efforts against ISIL in Iraq; notes that Her Majesty's Government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; and offers its wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty's armed forces."</p>
<p>What does a Christian say? What does the Bible teach? Is there a "Just War"? The Church of England's formal answer is in its Article XXXVII of the <em>Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England.</em> This says:</p>
<blockquote><div>it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in wars.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Christian and War</strong></p>
<p>There is a clear New Testament duty to be non-resisting (Mat 5.39). But at the same time there is a duty laid on the State to be (Rom 13.4) "the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer."</p>
<p>In the first few centuries of the Church's life the early Christians saw the importance of both duties. They believed that as individuals they must never harm or inflict suffering on others. But at the same time they believed the [pagan] State was divinely ordained to repress crime and violence with force.</p>
<p>In the time of the Emperor Constantine, when the Roman Empire officially became "Christian", there was a dilemma. It was the dilemma of reconciling the love of Christ that leads to non-aggression with the need of the State to enforce justice. Suddenly some Christians found themselves in positions of political authority. They then read Paul and found him saying in one and the same breath that individuals should not themselves "take revenge", while legitimate rulers who "bear the sword" should avenge others and enforce God's judgment on evil. And they concluded that when evil was being perpetrated by a neighbouring state, "bearing the sword" meant war. Of course, this was a dilemma, a terrible dilemma. But many Christians, entrusted by God with political authority, felt that in good conscience they could not opt out. And many still believe that. They realise that they have to exercise power or force in the interests of justice whether in peace-time (through sentencing criminals for punishment), or in time of war.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>
<p><em>"Just War Theory"</em> was designed to help with this dilemma. It justified war not as self-defence, but as a means of ensuring justice. The personal "turning of the other cheek" is not denied. It is rather that the political power of those seeking public justice needs to be regulated. But in such matters the difficulty is that things are not black and white. "Calculation" is needed. Jesus claimed that cool calculation in human existence is essential in a number of situations. Indeed he argues that cool calculation should lead to a willingness to sacrifice everything for the privilege of being a Christian disciple. But right calculation is also needed in war, together with property development. This was the subject of one of Jesus' parables (Luke 14.28-33):</p>
<blockquote><div> For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.' &nbsp;Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</div></blockquote>
<p>The contrast in the parable shows different sorts of calculation. One is for tower-building, the other for using force in war. In tower-building it is easy. There are simple costs to be added up. If the builder can find the precise sum of money, he will be successful. But success in war is so different. There are no simple mathematics. The king does not just sit down and do his sums and "count the cost". Rather, we are told by Jesus, he has to "sit down first <em>and deliberate</em> whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand." Deciding about war is far less precise. It is a matter of judgment and prudence. As many facts as can be known have to be assembled. Then a decision has to be taken in the light of these facts. So in the nature of things there will be far less certainty when going to war that when building a tower.</p>
<p><strong>Just War Theory</strong></p>
<p>This was the difficulty for President Obama and David Cameron regarding intervention in Syria last year and ISIL this year. When nothing is crystal clear, from a Christian perspective there must be the restraints of Just War Theory.</p>
<p>What is Just War Theory? It was a theory that evolved in the Church during the middle ages and the Renaissance. But it was Augustine who had provided the ground work. All else followed from his discussion on the subject. Professor Oliver O'Donovan describes the theory as "a systematic attempt to interpret acts of war by analogy with acts of civil government, not, be it noted, to afford some justification for war-making, but to bring it under the restraint of those moral standards which apply to other acts of government."</p>
<p>The doctrine is limiting. It means that not all is fair in love and war. There have to be guidelines. If a war is to be fought, it has to be fought justly.</p>
<p>There were five basic principles in the theory. Three dealt with engaging in war and two dealt with the conduct of war. The three that deal with the right engagement in war are these. First, the responsibility for waging war is not just anybody's; rather it belongs to the legitimate authority. Secondly, the "cause" has to be just. And, thirdly, there has to be a right motive. But the two that deal with the right conduct of war are perhaps most easily forgotten. These relate first to the principle of "discrimination" and secondly to the principle of "proportion".</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination and Proportion</strong></p>
<p>"Discrimination" means that force must only be applied to combatants and with the intention of depriving them of their ability to wage war. There must be no intention to attack non-combatants. An enemy prisoner of war, unable to be violent, must therefore be treated as a non-combatant. "Total" (indiscriminate) war is obviously ruled out. Of course, there must be a distinction drawn between the result of violent action and the intention behind it. If there is an intention to destroy a military command post or an armoured column, but the result is unforeseen civilian casualties, that is utterly tragic. But it is not wicked in the way aiming a missile indiscriminately at a centre of population is, with the intention of destroying civilian morale.</p>
<p>"Proportion" means that no more force or violence should be used than is necessary. But what is enough force is a matter for calculation and consultation. That is where Jesus' parable of "a king about to go to war" is so true to life. It is not a matter of mathematical certainty but of prudent judgment. And the parable is an important reminder that some calculations mean there are occasions when you cannot conduct war, however, much you may want to. If the calculations show that you cannot win, you have to "ask for terms of peace" – that is to say, negotiate the best terms of peace possible. All this obviously relates to the vote on the last Friday of September 2014.</p>
<p>But none of the calculating must ever be "cold". There is an instinct in Christian understanding that war may be right. Yet to execute someone in war (or peace) is not only horrific but defiling. It is worth remembering that just before he invaded Britain, William the Conqueror had a banner blessed by the Pope. After the battle of Hastings, however, he was required to do penance for the bloodshed. Whatever may be thought about "blessing banners" (or battleships or bombers) and "penance", something was properly understood all those years ago, back in the 11th century. With all this in mind, how do we evaluate the debates and decisions of the House of Commons and House of Lords in the 21st century? In making it clear that some action to restrain ISIL is required, must be right, as the situation is very serious. But precisely what action is required?</p>
<p><strong>The Seriousness of the Situation</strong></p>
<p>Here is the report of an Iraqi Christian woman, who recently defied ISIS terrorists. She knows how serious the situation is for individuals: "Weeping as she recounted her ordeal, Khiria said she and husband, Mufeed Wadee' Tobiya, awoke on the morning of 7 August to find that Qaraqosh had been over-run by ISIS fighters. She was told repeatedly by the militants, 'who spoke different languages', from the first day that if she did not convert to Islam she would be decapitated. When she refused, she and 46 women, who had also rejected such demands, were separated from their families and whipped and beaten over a 10 day period in an attempt to make them abandon their faith. Khiria said: 'I answered [the terrorists] immediately, "I was born Christian and if that leads me to death, I prefer to die a Christian."' Quoting from the Gospel of St Matthew (10.33) she said: 'Jesus said: "Whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven"' … She said that none of the women capitulated under the scourging and other cruelties inflicted upon them. 'All of us were crying but refused to covert' … On the 10th day all of the women were assembled together again and a terrorist 'put a sword on my neck in front of all the ladies and said to me: "convert or you will be killed."' Khiria answered: 'I am happy to be a martyr.' At that point the terrorists relented, and robbed her of all her possessions, including money she had saved for a kidney operation, and drove close to Kurdish territory where she was released on 4 September along with her husband and two other women" (<em>Catholic Herald</em> 12 September 2014).</p>
<p>But the situation is also very serious globally and not just in Iraq and Syria as Lord Alderdice explained in the House of Lords' debate on ISIL: "We are in a dangerous place. The whole of that region – and countries much more widely – are dissolving into chaos, this is not simply a war like in the past. It comes close to home because it affects many people here. It is inevitable that there will be those who will want to conduct atrocities in this country to prosecute the aims of ISIS and others. There is also the possibility – indeed, almost the inevitability – of a whole new generation of young people being drawn into the jihadist orbit, just like the Arab Afghans going to Afghanistan in the 1980s. This will preoccupy us for a long time. Pope Francis indicated a fear on his part that we were falling piecemeal into a World War III. He is not a man who speaks lightly about these things. While there is a grave decision to be taken by the Commons¸ it is made all the graver because we are slipping, at least in some parts of our world, into something of a dark age. We must pray that it does not last as long as the religious wars in our own continent."</p>
<p><strong>ISIL's relationship with Islam</strong></p>
<p>Clearly we are facing great evil. The Prime Minister said in the House of Commons debate: "We are dealing with a generational struggle caused by the perversion of one of the world's great religions, Islam, but I have no doubt that this struggle is one that this House and this country are more than equal to." Ed Milliband, the leader of the opposition, said: "Let us be clear about what this is: ISIL is murdering Muslims … Leading British Muslim scholars and imams recently wrote of ISIL: 'They are perpetrating the worst crimes against humanity … it is a war against all humanity.' ISIL's ideology has nothing to do with the peaceful religion practised by billions of people across the world and by millions of our fellow citizens, who are appalled by their actions." But is ISIL a "perversion" and "nothing to do with the peaceful religion practised by millions"? Certainly huge percentages of Muslims around the world are peaceful (see the <em>Pew Research Religion &amp; Public Life Project – The World's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society</em> 2013). But has ISIL nothing to do with Islam?</p>
<p>In a House of Lords' debate last 19 November on this very question - of Islam not justifying terror - Lord Sheikh said: "It is written in the Holy Koran, 'whoever kills a human being – it is as though he has killed all mankind, and whoever saves a human life, it is as though he has saved all mankind.' That is why I have consistently spoken about Islam as a religion of peace and continue to do so." Lord Sheikh was quoting from Sura 5.32. But he omitted to explain what immediately follows in 5.33. That says: "the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and his Messenger and strive upon earth to cause corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land." One Muslim scholar says that "beheading", historically, took the place of crucifixion (presumably as being more humane). I am sure today people still modify those punishments, as crucifixion was changed to beheading. But it seems ISIL wants to go back to the primitive traditions.</p>
<p><strong>The Archbishop of Canterbury</strong></p>
<p>When the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke in the debate in the 28 September debate in the House of Lords, he was, of course, speaking from a Christian perspective. He said: "the danger of this debate is that we speak only of Iraq and Syria, ISIL and armed force. ISIL and its dreadful barbarity are only one example of a global phenomenon [<em>another Peer had already referred to Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in Somalia and al-Qaeda in Yemen</em>] … We are dealing with a generational struggle caused by the perversion of one of the world's great religions. … We will not thus be able to deal with a global holistic danger if the only weapons we are capable of using are military and administrative, and if we focus only on one place. It is clear … that we need to take this action now [<em>agreeing with David Cameron's proposal</em>]. However, it is also necessary over time that any response to ISIL and to this global danger be undertaken on an ideological and religious basis that sets out a more compelling vision, a greater challenge, and a more remarkable hope than that offered by ISIL. We must face the fact that for some young Muslims the attractions of jihadism outweigh the materialism of a consumer society. As Lord Alderdice implied, if we struggle against a call to eternal values, however twisted and perverted they may be, without a better story we will fail in the long term … It is the role of the church I serve to point beyond our imperfect responses and any material, national or political interest, to the message of Jesus Christ and the justice, healing and redemption that he offers."</p>
<p>The Archbishop was drawing attention to the fact that while the evil and violence of this jihadism has, rightly, to be resisted and stopped, the reason for the evil and violence also has to be considered and dealt with. And one reason is a disenchantment with Western materialism. We can add to that a further consideration and say, as we face radical Islam, we have to face <em>two extremisms</em>. One is this Islamic extremism; but the other is an insidious and progressively totalitarian and intolerant Western extremism that seems more benign in its political correctness and secularity; yet it is destroying human life (through abortion on demand) and destroying <em>family</em> life (through both the promotion of sexual decadence and the devaluation of marriage by introducing same-sex marriages) and seeking to enforce Christian agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Sayyid Qutb</strong></p>
<p>But what do the Islamic radicalizers really believe apart from Western materialism being wrong? I understand that there are currently no Western journalists "embedded" among the ISIL fighters – and for good reason. So what we know is limited. However, we can know what Sayyid Qutb believed from his book <em>Milestones.</em> This is a short revolutionary book Qutb wrote while in prison in Egypt (1956-64) before his execution in 1966. He has been described as "the godfather of radical Islam". Some say what Marx was to Communism, Qutb has been to radical Islam. At least he has been, as one scholar claims, "the major influence on the worldview of radical movements across the Muslim world." Qutb wrote to encourage Muslims to go back to the Koran and the teaching of Mohammed. It is a call to avoid the decadent values of the West. It is a call that in "modernizing" (he is not opposed to scientific activity) Islam should not lose its roots.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be all sorts, including psychopathic hangers on, in these radical Islamic groups. But ISIL and others will have their own mainstream and if "Qutbian", will teach a total commitment to Islam with, as they see it every aspect of life under God's sovereignty as interpreted and taught by Mohammed. But those who reject what they see as divine teaching should be opposed <em>including other Muslims</em>. Furthermore, all human forms of sovereignty (including the secular state) must be opposed. And the method of opposition is to be preaching and persuading individuals but "physical power and <em>Jihaad</em> for abolishing the organizations and authorities of the <em>Jahili</em> system [<em>the ignoring of divine guidance</em>] which prevents people from reforming their ideas and beliefs but forces them to obey their erroneous ways and make them serve human lords instead of the Almighty Lord." And what in practice seems to happen when persuasion does not persuade, is that individuals become <em>Jahili</em> enemies, and physical force is applied. And tragically Qutb's right opposition to Western sexual decadence, has meant more violence - witness the wicked killings of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa for being (wrongly) identified with the Western homosexual agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>What is the way forward? As Christians you must "love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Mat 5.44), and evangelise. Muslims need to hear the truth as it is in Jesus Christ and turn to him. Forgiveness of sins and new birth through the Holy Spirit are the only ultimate solutions. So in the light of that and this present danger Paul's words to Timothy are still as relevant as ever (1 Tim 2.1-4):</p>
<blockquote><div>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, &nbsp;for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour, &nbsp;who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="British Values">(January 2015) British Values</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2015</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Department for Education Consultation</strong></p>
<p>2014 was the year for the UK Department for Education (DfE) to major on British values. On the 23 June 2014 it published a "Consultation on promoting British values in school". It was explained as "the launch of a consultation on strengthening powers to intervene in schools failing to promote British values". But what are British values and who should decide? The consultation made the Government's answer clear: British values are what the Government decide.</p>
<p>There were only a few weeks for responses to be submitted. Some had to be submitted by 4 August and others two weeks later by 18 August. What effect those responses had on the Department for Education is hard to say. But clearly the Department had made up its mind on British values, for it was fully prepared to issue binding regulations on schools on 4 September; and these were laid before Parliament on 8 September to come into force on 29 September. What the DfE has defined as "the fundamental British values" that educational institutions (including nurseries) must "actively promote" are: 1) <em>democracy,</em> 2) <em>the rule of law</em>, 3) <em>individual liberty</em> and 4) <em>mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.</em> However, there were issues with this definition. It produced a reaction from the<em> Christian Institute</em> who were threatening a judicial review in the light of the small print regarding the application of value "4" and sexuality, with the DfE saying that "actively promoting … means challenging pupils, staff or <em>parents</em> expressing opinions contrary to fundamental British values." It also produced an official reaction from the Church of England's National Society. This is responsible for the church's 4,700 state schools and so spoke for many when it made it clear "that British values should emanate from a broad public conversation, <em>and not from the Secretary of State.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>Further and other advice</strong></p>
<p>To quieten this disquiet the DfE in a statement on 27 November included the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>the definition of fundamental British values is not new. The values were set out in the government's Prevent strategy in 2011 and have been part of the Independent School Standards since the beginning of 2013. Although the Department for Education invited comments on the drafting of the SMSC standard, it proposed no changes to the definition of British values, which are widely used in other contexts. The purpose of the consultation was not to seek representation on the definition, but on the proposal to strengthen the requirement on schools to actively promote the values to emphasise their importance, rather than just encouraging pupils to respect them.</div></blockquote>
<p>But who has the right to define "fundamental British Values"? For issues such as "values" relating to "the SMSC (Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural) standard", must be considered as "religious" matters. And the DfE has already endorsed guidance given in 2010 that<em> "religion and beliefs</em> inform our values and are reflected in what we say and how we behave." Also that 2010 guidance reminds us that religious teaching in schools must be "consistent with Section 375(3) of the Education Act 1996, which requires the syllabus to reflect that <em>the religious traditions of Great Britain are in the main Christian</em> whilst taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain."</p>
<p>Furthermore there is a confusion in using the imprecise umbrella word "values". This has led the DfE (and others) to omit the distinction between what some call <em>"aims"</em> from what they call <em>"assumptions".</em> The omission then is of <em>the</em> great British "aim", namely the "pursuit of truth" and the overriding British "assumption", according to 1996 Education Act, of the "Christian tradition".</p>
<p><strong>Aims and assumptions</strong></p>
<p>So what are "aims"? They are the various components of what people consider the "good life". They are things for which people would make great sacrifices. They are truly <em>valuable</em> and so "values" such as, indeed, democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, respect and toleration, <em>and</em> the pursuit of truth. Nor are these aims to be seen only in terms of individual and personal goals, but in terms of the aspirations of a whole age or period. What, then, are "assumptions" in this context? "Assumptions" relate to wider questions of life and existence. They are the "background beliefs" people hold about the nature of the world, man and his place in society. They may be held almost unconsciously. They are rather like the air you breathe; you are not aware of it until it is no longer is there! And the most common source for these "assumptions" or background beliefs that nurture these "aims" is religious belief; so in Britain it is the Christian tradition.</p>
<p>This being the case, what is needed for human and social flourishing and cultural growth and vitality is this: the aims of a society (for example, democracy) need to be backed up by its background beliefs (such come from the Christian tradition). For these beliefs reinforce aims like democracy, law, liberty, respect and truth and prevent them being perverted. But if good aims are being held that are no longer backed up by society's current beliefs, you sooner or later have spiritual, moral, social and cultural decay - SMSC decay! Then without a peaceful religious revival, such societies are ripe for various forms of totalitarianism to bring about social order, whether secular fascist or religious jihadist.</p>
<p><strong>A previous discussion</strong></p>
<p>"British values" were last a genuinely public issue at the end of the Second World War. For example, in 1944 there was a famous series of lectures by varied lecturers including Dorothy Sayers and Christopher Dawson entitled <em>Our Culture – its Christian Roots and Present Crisis.</em> And the first lecture by V A Demant was entitled <em>The Aims and Assumptions of our Culture</em>. First, Demant argued that a culture's values or aims are the result of historic growth. These aims depend on definite influences or assumptions in its nation's history. But if these influences or assumptions dry up, like a plant uprooted from the ground, it will die. That is why, secondly, he argued that like a plant a culture needs to be tended. So those who enjoy it have to make every effort to preserve it.</p>
<p>And this is helpful to remember at any time and not just when Hitler was still a threat. For when we listen to Demant, we recognize parallels today with 1944. These were his words then: "We have taken our civilization for granted; or, to change the metaphor, it has become an artificial superstructure upon crumbling foundations … This culture which we inherit from past ages in Europe, and which has its own variations of character in different lands, as it has in our Anglo-Saxon culture, is in the twentieth century the subject of a number of colossal revolutions. It is in a state of judgment. The crisis, as I interpret it [<em>in 1944</em>], has two phases. In the "democratic" communities the aims of men are on the whole still those of European civilization, so largely formed by Christian outlooks; but the assumptions, the things they take for granted and the habits considered normal, have been formed by influences which are opposed to the aims. The contradiction is not conscious. In the "totalitarian" countries, on the other hand, the conflict has been solved by abolishing the aims and finding new ones to fit in with the assumptions and habits."</p>
<p>The good news for us today is that "crumbling foundations" can be strengthened. They were at the end of the war by a self-conscious return to Christian roots in Europe by key opinion formers. So in the same year that Demant was lecturing, when the "education for all" <em>1944 Education Act</em> was introduced in the House of Lords, Lord Selbourne, referring to its Christian values (and with Hitler still undefeated), said this: "The real enemy is naked materialistic paganism which has reared its head in Europe to a height unknown for a 1,000 years which threatens Christianity today and with it our civilization, our homes and our people ... Anglo-Saxon democracy would perish without the Christian ethic and unless we are brought up to be a God-fearing Christian nation, all our vaunted progress in other directions will crumble into dust." Then as a new vision for Europe was being born it was unashamedly Christian. So on 19 March 1958, addressing the first European Parliament, Robert Schuman, architect and driving force of the first Community, said "all the countries of Europe are permeated by Christian civilization. It is the soul of Europe which must be restored to it." Even Jacques Delors in 1999 speaking of the Christian heritage of Europe, said: "The contribution of Christianity remains essential precisely because of the wisdom with which it nourishes its vision of humanity and because of its appeal to the renewal of faith in the values that are the legacy of the gospel."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><em>Article XX</em> of the established Church of England's <em>Thirty-nin</em>e says "the Church hath ... authority in Controversies of Faith". So as controversy over values is a "Controversy of Faith", the Government needs challenging by (believing orthodox) Christians to add "the pursuit of truth" and "the Christian tradition" to its four values, and needs challenging before the General Election, and certainly before the promised European Referendum. The need for truth is self-evident; and it needs the Christian tradition because it <em>prevents</em> 1) democracy allowing 51 percent to enslave 49 percent of the people, 2) the rule of law sanctioning evil laws, 3) individual liberty fracturing social order and drifting into anarchy; and it <em>requires</em> 4) mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. For accepting "<em>God and Caesar</em>" unlike secularism and Islam, it uniquely allows for pluralism; it sees each person made in God's image so with freedom and to be respected; but its tolerance seeks respectfully to correct what is false or wrong.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Christ and Christian Giving - Selections from J.

                                                <p><em>Dr J I Packer, one of the greatest Christian writers in the modern world, years ago, regularly preached at JPC when visiting our then Church Warden, Raymond Johnston, his friend from student days.

The following are extracts (minimally edited) from one of the four meditations.</em></p>
<p><strong>Biblical basics on money</strong></p>
<p>What is money? A medium of exchange and a means of gaining power and influence in your circle of society. Many view money as a kind of magic: the more they have of it, the more they want; the more doors they expect it to open for them; and, not surprisingly perhaps, the more reluctant they are to part with any of it. The result? Idolatry: we end up worshipping our investments, our possessions, and our bank balance. Jesus saw this and warns us against it: "You cannot serve God and money" (Matt. 6:24). Paul, also, warns of the money pitfall:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction: "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils" (1 Tim. 6:9–10).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So, what should we do when our basic needs have been met and we still have money in our pockets; when we find that doing whatever it is that we do professionally to earn our living, as we say, and that presumably we think of as service to others and so to God, is actually making money for us and the money is piling steadily up? Jesus and Paul give the same answer. Use the money, not for yourself, but for God and God's people; use it to spread God's kingdom; use it to help persons in need. See yourself as manager, steward, and trustee of God's funds, honoured by the responsibility you have been given but totally accountable to God who gave it to. Paul directs Timothy:</p>
<p>"As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nought to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life" (1 Tim. 6:17–19).</p>
<p>It was Luther, so we are told, who said that everyone needs three conversions: conversion of the mind to gospel truth; conversion of the heart to embrace the Lord Jesus as Saviour and Master; and conversion of the wallet or cheque-book, the laying of one's money at Christ's feet. Luther certainly knew that getting sin out of the driver's seat in relation to our money is one of the most difficult dimensions of the sinner's repentance. Today, pastors often tell us that when people become Christians, the last thing in their life to be touched by God's transforming grace is regularly their wallet. When directed to commit their time, talents, and treasure to the Lord, giving him financial control starts later, goes slower, and takes longer than does the forming of the other two habits, presumably because the inner resistance is stronger.</p>
<p>A comic strip I enjoyed showed a mother, with a bawling baby in her arms, chatting in the street with a friend: "What's the trouble with baby?" "Oh, he's teething." "And your husband (who is sitting on a bench in the background, his open-mouthed agony matching that of the baby)?" "Oh, he's tithing." Tithing as a life commitment to Christian giving at 10% annually is always a good start, but however much it is commended from the pulpit, it is constantly evaded by those in the pew. To motivate generous giving goes against the grain of the fallen human heart, and so it is always hard labour.</p>
<p><strong>Money and our management, ministry and mind-set</strong></p>
<p><em>First,</em> when we set ourselves to think about Christian money management, in whatever connection, from buying groceries to supporting missionaries to investing in industry to financing a holiday, the first thing we have to get clear on is that the money that is ours to manage is not ours, but God's. Yes, we have been given it to use, but it remains his. We have it as a loan, and in due course we must give account to him of what we have done with it. That is the point of the word <em>stewardship,</em> which nowadays is in effect the church's label for the discipline of giving. Society (which Scripture calls "the world") sees each person's money as his own possession, to use as he likes. Scripture, however, sees our money as a trust from God, to be used for his glory: "All that is in heaven and in the earth is yours … <em>All things come from you, and of your own have we given you"</em> (1 Chron. 29:11,14). Such is the constant biblical perspective.</p>
<p><em>Secondly,</em> Christian giving is ministry with God's money. Ministry means service; service means relieving need; need means a lack of something that one cannot well do without. Paul calls his great plan of financial help for the Christian poor in Jerusalem "the ministry for the saints" (2 Cor. 9:1) because the poverty of the poor is denying them necessities of life. The ministry of giving has many goals: spreading the gospel, sustaining the church, providing care for distressed individuals (as the Samaritan in Jesus's story did for the beaten up, half-dead Jew), and for distressed groups like the Jerusalem Christians, and more. The ministry of giving in all its forms aims to advance the Kingdom of God, which becomes a reality in human life whenever the values and priorities of Christ's teaching are observed. It goes without saying that in this ministry, all God's people are meant to be involved.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly,</em> Christian giving is a mind-set regarding God's money. A mind-set, or mentality as we may prefer to call it, is a characteristic attitude, a habitual orientation, an entrenched desire, and as such a matter of motivation and purpose. Christian giving aims at pleasing and glorifying God and never settling for what is clearly second best. That raises the question,<em> how much</em> should one give? Specifically, should we tithe? Some seem to think that tithing is like paying God rent: when we have given him 10% of our income, the rest is ours. But no, it is all God's. What Paul tells the Corinthians is not that they should raise their share of the collection for the Jerusalem poor by tithing, but that if they give generously to God, he will give generously to them (2 Cor. 9:6,8,11,13).</p>
<p>Paul's appreciation of the Macedonians for giving "according to their means … and beyond their means, of their own accord" (8:3) suggests that his answer to the question, "how much should one give?" would be, give all you readily, easily, and comfortably can, and then prove your zeal and wholeheartedness for God by giving something more. In the light of Jesus's commendation of the poor widow who put into the Temple Treasury or she had, it is natural to suppose he too would answer our question by challenging us along these lines. This is how C.S.Lewis was thinking when he directed a correspondent who had put our question to him, "Give till it hurts." It may be a good idea to practice tithing as a crutch until we get used to giving larger sums than we gave before, but then we should look forward to leaving the crutch behind because now we will have formed the Christian habit of giving more than 10%. When the amount to give is in question, the sky should be the limit, and the word of wisdom, "Go for it."</p>
<p><strong>Motives and methods</strong></p>
<p>Four "Be-attitudes" (imperatives about Christian living) suggest some motives.</p>
<p><em>First,</em> be grateful to your gracious God - "for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich" (2 Cor. 8:9). <em>Secondly,</em> be generous to your needy neighbour - every person whom you meet, or who confronts you, whose need, once you see it, you must do your best to relieve, like the Good Samaritan. <em>Thirdly,</em> be given to Christ your Saviour as his disciple and be self-giving to others. <em>Fourthly,</em> be a glorifier of God. Generous giving, in particular, will ordinarily give rise to this effect (glory to God), as will all the forms of single-minded obedience and service to God that others see in us.</p>
<p>And Paul teaches four points about how we should give.</p>
<p><em>First,</em> giving should be voluntary and cheerful, and not cause you are hounded for money: "Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:7). <em>Secondly,</em> giving should be deliberate and thoroughly thought out, taking account of all the pre-existing financial claims that we are under obligation to meet. Maximal giving must not lose touch with reality and become irresponsible, any more than it should invoke the Corban" evasion of the Pharisees that Jesus dennounced in Mark 7: 9-13. "If the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have" (2 Cor. 8:12). Readiness with realism is what he is commending. <em>Thirdly,</em> giving should be wisely managed. Paul understands Christian fellowship to require of him (in his collection for Jerusalem), and of everyone else, a threefold relational concern - to trust, to be trusted, and to be found trustworthy. <em>Fourthly</em> and finally, giving, where possible, should be cooperative. Giving fair shares - fair in the sense not of all parties giving equal amounts, but of all being equally committed to giving all they can and so helping each other to reach the target (2 Cor. 8:10-15), deepens fellowship wonderfully.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Jesmond Conference 2015 - Statement">(March 2015) The Jesmond Conference 2015 - Statement</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2015</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>(The following is the Statement agreed at the recent Jesmond Conference held at the Holiday Inn, Jesmond. It was a private conference for Anglican clergy and others involved in schools, student and youth work, in various capacities.)</em></p>
<p><strong>The conference and British values</strong></p>
<p>On the 23rd and 24th February 2015 18 Anglican clergy together with Christian head teachers, school governors, lawyers, youth and student church workers met together in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne for 24 hours at the Jesmond Conference (on British values in the light of the Bible and the Christian tradition). This was convened by the vicar of Jesmond, David Holloway, to consider the Government's statement of <em>"fundamental</em> British values". These its Department for Education brought to public attention in the summer of 2014 in response to some non faith-based state-maintained Birmingham schools where there were attempts to make them, as was alleged, into Muslim schools. These <em>"fundamental</em> British values" that educational institutions (including nurseries) must now "actively promote" are: <em>1) democracy, 2) the rule of law, 3) individual liberty</em> and<em> 4) mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.</em></p>
<p>In preparation for the conference members read the short book produced for the conference, <em>British Values and the National Church – essays on Church and State from 1964-2014 (</em>The Latimer Trust, 2015). This highlighted the fact that the values or aims of a society have to be backed up by fundamental world-views, outlooks or assumptions; and these assumptions that have given rise to the Government's British values have been assumptions from the Christian tradition. But this tradition has also given rise to the <em>"fundamental</em> British value" the pursuit of truth, which the Government has ignored.</p>
<p><strong>British values 1944</strong></p>
<p>The last major "national conversation" on British values was in 1944, with Hitler still undefeated, and of which the debates relating to the great Education Act 1944 were a significant part. The fact of the essential nature of the Christian tradition was at that time made so clear by Lord Selbourne. Summing up for the Government in the concluding debate on the bill in the House of Lords, he famously said that Anglo-Saxon democracy cannot function <em>"unless it is based on the Christian ethic,</em> and if it is transplanted to any country where that ethic is rejected, it would wither and die amid great human suffering" (prophetic words for the 21st century and the situation in North Africa and the Middle East); and his final words were these:</p>
<blockquote><div>The real enemy is … the naked materialistic paganism, which has reared its head in Europe to a height unknown for a 1000 years, and which threatens Christendom today. and with it our civilization, our homes and our people. I trust and pray that this Bill … may lead us to an England that is not only better educated, more cultured, better qualified to face the tasks of citizenship and better equipped in craftsman ship, but also an England which allows as never before<em> the principle of liberty, justice, toleration and discipline on which this realm depends, and which themselves are founded on the teaching of the Church of Christ.</em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The need to add "the pursuit of truth" and "the Christian tradition"</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, as a new Europe was being born it was unashamedly Christian. On 19 March 1958, addressing the first European Parliament, Robert Schuman, architect and driving force of the European Community said, "all the countries of Europe are permeated by Christian civilization. It is the soul of Europe which must be restored to it".</p>
<p>Aware of these historical concerns, the vicar of Jesmond had called the conference on the basis that the Government's British values are urgently in need of supplementing as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of those with different beliefs, <em>the pursuit of truth and the Christian tradition</em> (with the latter to be interpreted in the light of the requirement for all schools subject to Section 375(3) of the Education Act 1996 which says 'the religious traditions of Great Britain are in the main Christian while taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain').</div></blockquote>
<p>The need for "the pursuit of truth" is fundamental in the British liberal tradition, both in terms of science and honesty – with truthfulness, according to John Locke the great advocate for liberal tolerance, "the bond of human society". The need for "the Christian tradition" is because it prevents 1) democracy allowing 51 percent to enslave 49 percent of the people, 2) the rule of law sanctioning what is dehumanizing, 3) individual liberty fracturing social order and drifting into anarchy; and "the Christian tradition" <em>requires</em> 4) mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. For accepting "God and Caesar" unlike extreme Secularism (only accepting Caesar) and extreme Islam (only accepting God), it uniquely allows for pluralism; it sees each person made in God's image, so with freedom and to be respected; but its tolerance seeks respectfully, and therefore peacefully, to correct what is false and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>The conference process</strong></p>
<p>With this background the members of the Jesmond Conference met to consider and consult over the Government's four British values but in the light of the Christian tradition and a concern for the truth regarding the issues involved. Since in the Christian tradition truth comes from Jesus Christ and his Apostles, through reading the Scriptures, the conference had two helpful Bible expositions by Ian Garrett, then four 20 minute papers from the vicar of Jesmond, on each of the Government's values. Conference members then contributed further analysis with short term and long term suggestions for action. The conference concluded with a Global view on the British situation from the Archbishop of Kenya's Officer for Anglican Communion Affairs, Charles Raven, and further discussion.</p>
<p>The consultation in Jesmond was seen simply as a beginning, and contributing to a new "national conversation" on British values in the light of the forth-coming General Election and the inevitable national debate after the General Election on Europe. The conference resolved, <em>one,</em> to request the Government to supplement its four British values with "the pursuit of truth" and "the Christian tradition" as vital to ensuring that the British liberal tradition is maintained, and, <em>two,</em> to continue, and promote, the "conversation" in their churches and in the world as they are able.</p>

                                                <p>At Jesmond Parish Church over the last three months on Sunday Mornings we have been thinking about the <em>Thirty-nine Articles</em> of the Church of England. We ended the series of sermons last week with Article VIII that is entitled<em> Of the Three Creeds</em> and which says this:</p>
<blockquote><div>The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of holy Scripture.</div></blockquote>
<p>Of those three creeds, the <em>Athanasian Creed</em> is unique to the Church of England. This, says one commentator on the Articles, <em>" … was probably due to the desire of our Reformers to emphasize the importance of instruction and the necessity of an intelligent, clear, full faith. Up to that time </em>[of the Reformation]<em> the Creed had been used as a Canticle </em>[a said or sung doxological hymn or psalm]<em>."</em></p>
<p>Be that as it may, it is to have its place as a Creed – a confession of faith – in the Church of England; and according to the tradition of the Book of Common Prayer the Athanasian Creed is to be said, among other times, at Easter. However, that tradition is seldom kept for two reasons: one, it is very long, and, two, it is capable of being misunderstood if without explanation. So for these reasons, occasionally I write about it and provide a copy for reading.</p>
<p><strong>The Issues</strong></p>
<p>But how did these creeds come about in the first place?</p>
<blockquote><div>Two thousand years ago in Israel, the man who is God incarnate, Jesus of Nazareth, led his followers into a life-giving relationship with himself and his divine Father, and was executed for being a revolutionary. Risen from the dead, he charged his followers to make disciples throughout the whole world, promising that he would be with them and equipping them for their mission with his Holy Spirit. The New Testament presents the essential witness and teaching of Jesus' first emissaries, the Apostles, who proclaimed his truth with his authority. The faith of Christians today, as in every age, is shaped and defined by this apostolic account of Jesus Christ. Within a century of Jesus' earthly ministry, Christian congregations could be found from Spain to Persia, and from North Africa to Britain. By this time, the catechumenate for would-be Christians (from the Greek katecheo meaning "I instruct") – a period of 1-3 years' instruction leading to baptism at Easter - had become established Christian practice. This pattern of Christian disciple-making continued for some centuries before falling into disuse, as nominal Christianity increasingly became a universal aspect of Western culture.</div></blockquote>
<p>So begins the Introduction to the new Anglican Catechism of ACNA (the Anglican Church in North America), <em>To Be A Christian</em>; for the Creeds would have all played a part in that catechizing. Those early Christians were facing intellectual challenges from the pagan and other-faith worlds, as Christians down the centuries, including today, have always had to face. But when the fundamentals of the faith were under attack on four key occasions in the first five centuries, the world-wide leaders of the Church met to pray, study and discuss the problems. They wanted to come to a common mind that was in line with the Apostolic teaching of the Bible. And as a result of those meetings or "Councils", we have the Creeds expressing that common mind.</p>
<p>The first of those Councils was at Nicea in 325 and repudiated Arianism – a heresy that denied Christ was truly God incarnate (come in the flesh). The second was at Constantinople in 381 that confirmed Nicea on the person of Christ (as is reflected in the Nicean Creed we say at Holy Communion). The third Council was at Ephesus in 431. That repudiated Nestorius' view; and used the term 'God-bearer' not to deify Mary the mother of Jesus, but to indicate that the baby born was truly God as well as truly man; he was not, as Nestorians said, a man who somehow had a divine alter ego, so almost two persons - Jesus the Man and Christ the divine.</p>
<p>The fourth Council was at Chalcedon in 451. This made clear that both the opposite error, namely that Christ was more divine than human and Nestorius' view were wrong! The Council at Chalcedon then saw the forging of the great consensus of believers not only on the person and nature of Jesus Christ (one person in two natures) but also on the divine Trinity. And the <em>Athanasian Creed</em> expresses that consensus.</p>
<p>It needs to be noted, therefore, that the <em>Athanasian Creed's</em> doctrines are statements that follow on from the facts and the mystery of God rather than try to explain them (so we have to hold in tension facts that are beyond our fiinite understanding). This Creed forms a boundary or fence around the truth. Its teaching is important in what is being ruled out. For example, the Creed rules out Tritheism (that there are three gods), Unitarianism (that there is one God who is not three and Christ not divine) and Modalism (that the one God simply plays three roles), as well as the heresies of Nestorius and his extreme opponents.</p>
<p><strong>The Text of the Athanasian Creed</strong></p>
<p>What then does the <em>Athanasian Creed</em> say? Here is a modern version from<em> An English Prayer Book</em>:</p>
<blockquote><div>Whosoever wishes to be saved before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic <em>[or universal]</em> faith, which faith, if anyone does not keep it whole and unharmed, without doubt he will perish everlastingly <em>[see the 'Comment' below]</em>. Now, the Catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the Persons nor dividing the divine being. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit, but the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is all one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son and such is the Holy Spirit: the Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated; the Father infinite <em>[Latin, 'inmensus']</em>, the Son infinite, and the Holy Spirit infinite; the Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal; and yet they are not three Eternals but one Eternal, just as they are not three Uncreateds, nor three Infinites, but one Uncreated and one Infinite. In the same way, the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty; and yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty. Thus the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three Gods but one God. Thus the Father is the Lord, the Son is the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the Lord; and yet not three Lords, but one Lord. Because, just as we are compelled by Christian truth to confess each Person singly to be both God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten; the Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created, but begotten; the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this Trinity there is no before or after, no greater or less, but all three Persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. So that in all things, as has already been said, the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, is to be worshipped. He therefore who wishes to be saved let him think thus of the Trinity.Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he should faithfully believe the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both God and man equally. He is God from the Being of the Father, begotten before the worlds, and he is man from the being of his mother, born in the world; perfect God and perfect man, having both man's rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards his divinity and inferior to the Father as regards his humanity; who, although he is God and man, yet he is not two, but one Christ; one, however, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by the taking up of humanity into God; utterly one, not by confusion of human and divine being but by unity of Christ's one Person. For just as the rational soul and flesh are one man, so God and man are one Christ; who suffered for our salvation, descended to the realm of the dead, rose again the third day from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the right hand of the Father, from where he will come to judge the living and the dead; at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies and will give an account for their own actions, and those who have done good will go into life everlasting and those who have done evil into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith which, if anyone does not believe faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<p>On the Creed's first sentence, C.S.Lewis writes:</p>
<blockquote><div>The operative word is keep; not acquire … but keep. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters ... who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion, ... to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought.</div></blockquote>
<p>And, also remember, with regard to the last sentence, "believing" is not the same as "imagining or understanding."</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Christian Institute's Election Briefing 2015 with an introduction by David Holloway">(May 2015) The Christian Institute's Election Briefing 2015 with an introduction by David Holloway</h2><ul><li>May 2015</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<blockquote><div>The Church and the official representatives of the Church must keep themselves from the entanglements of party politics. Their business is something far more fundamental and important; it is the formation of that mind and temper in the whole community which will lead to wholesome legislation by any party and all parties.</div></blockquote>
<p>So wrote Archbishop William Temple. But the situation today is very different. The reason is given by a distinguished academic – an Italian Professor of the Philosophy of Science and former President of the Italian Senate, Marcello Pera (and someone not a Christian):</p>
<blockquote><div>Today, politically speaking, liberals have won for the most part. The West has liberal constitutions, liberal institutions, liberal economies, and liberal systems of education. But we are so far from 'the end of history' that the same breach between liberalism and Christianity that shook our civilization a few generations ago is now presenting itself in a new form. Not in the violent forms of Nazism or communism, but in the form of liberal secularism. For the destinies of Europe and the West, this ideology is no less dangerous; it is rather more insidious. It does not wear the brutal face of violence, but the alluring smile of culture. With its words, liberal secularism preaches freedom, tolerance and democracy, but with its deeds it attacks precisely that Christian religion which prevents freedom from deteriorating into licence, tolerance into indifference, democracy into anarchy.</div></blockquote>
<p>So why and how should you vote? A useful resource in answering those questions is the Christian Institute's '<em>Election Briefing 2015</em>' (copies of which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.christian.org.uk/election/">christian.org.uk/election</a>). This very full briefing contains advice on contacting and speaking with candidates and a detailed analysis of the Coalition's Record, together with all the Parties' policies, on issues of concern&nbsp;for Christian voters. The following is from the briefing's own very helpful introduction. So many thanks to the Christian Institute.<br>--------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Why should you vote?</strong></p>
<p>The state is a means of God's 'common grace'. The Bible is very clear that the governing authorities act on God's behalf to restrain evil (see Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2). This is for the good of all people in this world – not just Christians.</p>
<p>As a general rule Christians follow Jesus' teaching recorded in Matthew 22:21: "<em>Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's</em>" (KJV). Christians are citizens of heaven (Philippians 3:20) and also of an earthly nation (usually where we are born). The Christian's duty is to obey the governing authorities. The exception is where they forbid what God requires, or require what God forbids (Acts5:29).</p>
<p>It is our earnest prayer that Christians will have freedom to share the Gospel and live out the Christian life (1 Timothy 2:1-4). In praying "deliver us from evil" (Matthew 6:13) we are praying against the persecution of the Churches as well as against personal temptation.</p>
<p>In our democracy we all have the legal right to vote. We elect Members of Parliament and so ultimately the Government. We help choose Caesar. So voting is a serious responsibility.</p>
<p>This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory in World War II. Huge numbers of our countrymen died during that war defending freedom, including the right to have an elected government. They secured for us the privilege of being able to vote, which is still effectively denied to billions of people around the world. We have the responsibility to use it well.</p>
<p>Multi-party democratic elections with a free press are relatively unusual both historically and globally. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index 2014 has found that fewer than 13 per cent of the world's population live-in a full democracy.</p>
<p>As we saw with same-sex marriage, Christians in Britain today live in a collapsing culture where God's laws are openly flouted. To some extent all of the schools. This is aimed at countering "extremism" but instead there have been hostile Ofsted inspections of Christian and Jewish schools, with children being asked very intrusive questions. One Christian school has-been closed. Meanwhile none of the infamous Trojan Horse schools have been closed.</p>
<p>Respected commentator Charles Moore warned in March 2015: <em>"Socially conservative moral views are now teetering on the edge of criminality, and are over the edge of disapproval by those who run modern Britain."</em></p>
<p>The marginalisation of Christians must be a vital issue for Christians at the General Election, and not only because we should have a special care for Christians who are suffering for their faith (Matthew 25:31-46; Galatians 6:10; Hebrews 13:3). Christ clearly taught that his followers are the salt which preserves society and the light which guides it (Matthew 5:13-16). If the salt remains in the salt cellar and the light is increasingly hidden under a secular bushel, then it will become very much harder for Christians to do those good works which transform society.</p>
<p><strong>Why this particular election is perplexing for biblical Christians</strong></p>
<p>Christians were deeply grieved at the passing of the same-sex marriage legislation, in a way which goes far beyond the general disillusionment with politicians in Britain today.</p>
<p>Marriage is intended by God to be the bedrock of our society. It is in the married family that children and adults learn to prefer the needs of others to their own. It is in the permanent relationship of marriage that children learn right from wrong and experience the stability of having parents who love each other just as much as they love them. It is in marriage that there is the union of the sexes and that children are raised with male and female role models in the image of God.</p>
<p>The breakdown of the family has led to manifold damaging social consequences in our society. The attack on marriage began long before same-sex marriage, yet for Parliament to legislate a lie into law is a very grave step to take. Marriage predates Parliament and even the nation state. It is the most basic institution of society.</p>
<p>So with same-sex marriage how wrong can you be? It uses man-made law to usurp God's good design for mankind.</p>
<p>There is a very large proportion of political issues where making a Christian judgment depends on the wise assessment of several biblical principles. This can result in Christians arriving at different conclusions. For example, we know for certain that the state has a right to levy taxes (Romans 13:7). But Christians who hold to biblical truth can legitimately disagree on the level of individual taxes.</p>
<p>In their 2015 public letter 'Who is my neighbour?' the Church of England's House of Bishops has drawn attention to a wide range of political issues, including European integration, debt, poverty, Trident and the environment. No doubt biblical teaching must be applied to all such matters, whether or not you reach their precise conclusions. It is welcome that the report gives arguments against euthanasia. But nothing is said about abortion, destructive experiments on embryos or same-sex marriage. The Roman Catholic Bishops didn't make that mistake and, unlike their Anglican counterparts, they also insisted that candidates must be questioned directly on where they stand on religious liberty.</p>
<p><strong>Two key factors in voting: candidates and parties</strong></p>
<p>For the European elections, candidates are ranked in order of preference by their parties. Electors then vote for the party. This is a particular form of proportional representation which makes it harder to vote for individual candidates.</p>
<p>For the Westminster elections it is very different. In the 'first past the post' system you vote for a particular candidate. So there are two key factors which we all must consider when deciding who to vote for. We must consider the candidates and we must consider the parties they represent.</p>
<p>It is very important to know what is going on in your constituency and to find out who your candidates are. A lot may hinge for you on the individual views of your candidates. In some constituencies there will be the option to vote for a candidate who takes a firm stand on moral issues, though this is not likely to be the norm.</p>
<p>The key to identifying your candidates is to be sure what parliamentary area (constituency) you live in. This website is helpful:<a href="https://yournextmp.com/"> yournextmp.com</a></p>
<p>In casting a vote Christians are not necessarily endorsing every item of policy of the party they vote for. You may decide to back a particular political party which most approximates to where you stand. Or you may consider it is better to vote for an exceptional candidate who shares your Christian views across a range of moral issues, even if they are standing for a party which you would not naturally support. You may decide that the most important consideration is to vote for the candidate who is standing for a party which in your view represents the 'least-worst' option. You may think that it is better to vote for one of the Christian political parties which may happen to stand in your area.</p>
<p>Sadly in some constituencies Christian believers may be in what feels like an impossible position. These are decisions which ultimately only you can make. Christians should prayerfully exercise their Christian conscience in these matters. Just because your parents or your work colleagues vote in a certain way does not mean that you need to do the same. It is your choice.</p>
<p>But you can't make an informed decision without knowing what the parties and the candidates stand for. Christians should make it their business to find out the policies of each candidate and party. You should seek to find out their positions on key moral issues.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that you will find a party or a candidate you believe has all the right views. For many Christians there is a genuine dilemma over choosing a party or a particular candidate. Whatever your decision it is relevant to consider how the parties fared in the last election in your constituency.</p>
<p><strong>The crucial issue of religious liberty</strong></p>
<p>Biblical Christians believe that the Gospel is paramount. Salvation is only found in Christ, not in any political programme. Yet followers of Christ are to care about their world, being salt and light in our society. And in order for that to happen, and for evangelism, there has to be freedom for the Gospel. Religious liberty is a crucial issue.</p>
<p>A country cannot really be free unless there is freedom of religion – liberty not only to believe certain things in your head, but to live out your faith in public. The importance attached to religious liberty has a long history in Britain. The year 2015 marks the 800th anniversary of <em>Magna Carta</em>, which is widely viewed as paving the way for modern democracy. How many people today realise that the first clause of Magna Carta sought to protect the legal freedom of the English Church?</p>
<p>Christians in Britain have enjoyed remarkable freedom for centuries now. It was hard won down the years, with setbacks and advances along the way. Many Christians elsewhere in the world do not have such freedom and we must pray for them. Our political leaders must do more to combat the persecution of Christians abroad.</p>
<p>Yet here in the UK religious liberty is being increasingly challenged. There have been cases where churches have come into conflict with the police because of a false accusation being made. Street preachers have been arrested. Christians have lost their jobs for answering questions about their faith or for taking an ethical stand. Christians in business have come into conflict with equality laws and faced fines for holding to the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.</p>
<p>Many Christians are also gravely concerned about legislative proposals which intrude into ordinary family life, evangelism and the running of the local church. Christians believe that governing authorities are established by God, but at the same time the Government is not responsible for everything. Indeed if there is to be freedom, it must not be.</p>
<p>It is important to say that society is more than the state. Society is made up of families and many institutions and organisations between the state and the citizen. In the West, unlike Communist countries, we do not equate society to the State. Government by itself cannot solve all our problems or even come remotely close.</p>
<p>Biblical Christians tend to be alarmed at the Scottish Parliament's Named Person scheme, which appoints a state guardian for every child in Scotland regardless of whether they need one. The named person will be able to go over the heads of parents to directly advise children. A ban on parental smacking, debated many times by the Welsh Assembly in recent years, could end up criminalising loving parents.</p>
<p>Many Christians were very concerned by Labour's attempt in 2010 to drastically restrict the freedom of churches to employ Christian staff outside of the position of a pastor.</p>
<p>Evangelicals are also concerned that Conservative plans to introduce 'Extremism Disruption Orders' could end up severely damaging free speech. They have already seen the impact of Nicky Morgan's 'British values' programme for<br>main parties are part of that moral decline. That doesn't make the choice of who to vote for very easy, but it's certainly a whole lot easier than living in an authoritarian regime like Zimbabwe or Burma.</p>
<p>The General Election provides an opportunity for Christians to speak out and play their part in voting. Governments can make it easier or harder to be a Christian or to share the Gospel. Believers have to make a judgment about how their vote can be used to best effect.</p>
<p><strong>Biblical priorities</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a matter of public policy, Christians have to assess biblical priorities. We can distinguish those political issues on which the Bible is absolutely clear from those where the Bible is not clear.</p>
<p>The Bible is not clear on how to improve access to GPs' surgeries or the most appropriate level of university tuition fees. To decide on these issues involves a detailed assessment of the facts and the exercise of judgment based on experience. Many situations we encounter in ordinary life are at this level and so are many political issues.</p>
<p>But at the other end of the spectrum the Bible is "clear, direct, and decisive" about a whole host of political issues. For example, a vote for abortion or euthanasia is a vote to break the sixth Commandment on the law of murder (Exodus 20:13). These are the kinds of issues that we focus on in this briefing –straightforward matters of right or wrong.</p>
<p>Archbishop William Temple famously used the analogy of an engineer who wants to build a bridge. Christians can preach 'make a safe bridge' – that's a clear moral principle, but it's up to engineers to come up with the particular design.</p>
<p>The economy is a major issue being discussed during the election campaign. All the main party leaders agree that the deficit has to be addressed. It is plainly wrong if a government accumulates massive public debt without any intention of repaying it. This is stealing from future generations. But Christians can legitimately disagree about how to tackle the deficit, because in order to make a judgment many facts need to be assessed.</p>
<p>Many people, Christians and non-Christians, believe there has been a profound breach of trust over redefining marriage. They will not forget this. Vernon Bogdanor, the respected Professor of Government, recently highlighted same-sex marriage as one of the three main reasons why people feel "unrepresented" at Westminster.</p>
<p>The redefinition of marriage is plainly contrary to the Bible. But it was also introduced in a deceitful way. The political leaders hid their true intentions at the last election: for example, none of the three main parties at Westminster included same-sex marriage in their manifesto in 2010. The three party leaders went on to redefine marriage as quickly as possible, hoping it would be forgotten by 7 May 2015.</p>
<p>A majority of Conservative backbenchers voted against same-sex marriage. But it is also true that three days before the election David Cameron specifically denied that he planned to introduce same-sex marriage in an interview with Sky News. So there has been a huge breach of trust. In 2010 the political parties knowingly sold Christians a false prospectus. Christians are perplexed by all of this.</p>
<p>Some Christians may quietly think there is now no point in voting at all, that politicians will not listen to them in future. But we must remember the Bible's teaching on government and common grace. God has ordained the governing authorities in every country – as Romans 13 makes clear – whether rulers are Christian or not. There are many non-Christians who take the right view on a range of issues. Nobody's thinking is secular at every point. Even politicians who disagreed with us about redefining marriage can still strongly agree that assisted suicide or liberalising cannabis laws are wrong. Some atheists will strongly defend the free speech of Christians. The Christian Institute can testify that there are men and women of integrity in parties across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Like the prophet Daniel, God's people must encourage leadership which promotes truth and righteousness, such as when he said to Nebuchadnezzar: "Therefore, O king, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed" (Daniel 4:27).Unlike Daniel, Christians in the UK today get to play a part in electing their leaders. It is not only right but essential that Christians in Britain engage in the General Election by voting and by witnessing to the truth.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Why God is 'He" Not "She"">(June 2015) Why God is "He" Not "She"</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2015</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>
                                                <p>On 1 June 2015 the BBC was promoting the views of a female clergyman in the Church of England, the Chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford. She was arguing for God to be called "she". This was on the <em>PM </em>programme. Michael Nazir-Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester, opposed this suggestion.</p>
<p>Such a discussion was yet another example of an extremely dangerous phenomenon in both the Church and the wider society. That is because, both in Church synods and in the wider society's electronic media (not least in the BBC), the discussion of very serious issues is too often not responsible reflection and dialogue. Rather, to quote Philip Turner: "<em>what parades as reflection and dialogue on the whole is no more than impassioned repetition, within a politically controlled space, of hardened positions.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>The Feminization of God</strong></p>
<p>To further the discussion, it needs to be noted that the suggested feminization of God has already been under way in the BBC. I myself heard last year in a broadcast religious service the Rev Ernie Rea, the BBC's former Head of Religion and Ethics, failing to use the traditional blessing but adopting a gender-free blessing. So instead of praying that the "<em>blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, be among you and remain with you always</em>", there was the "<em>blessing of God Almighty, creator, redeemer and sanctifier</em>", thus avoiding any masculine names. But this is no longer trinitarian but modalist ("modalism" is the heresy where there is <em>no Trinity</em> of one God in three persons but one God with three different modes of working).</p>
<p>However, now a campaigning feminist group in the Church of England, having secured women bishops, have a new strapline "<em>just getting started</em>"; and they are claiming that women bishops will make a difference "<em>only if God is she as often as she is he – because this is such a formative aspect of our church life, and a real bastion of sexism.</em>" Interestingly, Sheldon Vanauken, the inventor of the word "sexism" (in December 1968), would disagree. In later life he argued that the pendulum for women's rights had swung too far. So he opposed "priestesses" and the Feminists Bible, especially its "my loving parent" for "Abba, Father"!</p>
<p>So what precisely is theological feminization? To understand its seriousness we need to start with defining terms. If "sex" refers to what the body is, namely male or female, the different "genders", namely masculine or feminine, refer to everything else that is not limited to the body – such as the complex of behaviour, mental qualities and personality characteristics. So to quote one definition from Leon Podles, <em>The Church Impotent – the feminization of Christianity</em>, "<em>maleness is a physical quality, masculinity a cultural and spiritual one, although one that is connected with the physical realities of being male.</em>" The same goes for "femaleness" and "femininity". However, "masculinity" and "femininity", being cultural realities tied to physical realities are not entirely cultural constructs. So they will involve a natural and instinctive aspect. But also there will be a need for learning what is considered good or bad in terms of masculinity and femininity. It is obvious that girls, for example, brought up by prostitutes and boys by gangsters will be different to those brought up by good Christian mothers and good Christian fathers.</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Teaching on God and Masculinity</strong></p>
<p>But what does the Bible teach about any of this? Certainly masculinity is a key concern of the Old Testament. That is why some feminists (male and female) want to cut out references to God as masculine in translations of the Bible and in Christian liturgies, as Ernie Reay did, or balance them with feminine references, as the chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford, wants. But as Leon Podles says:</p>
<blockquote><div>these translators confuse maleness and masculinity, a crucial distinction of which the Scriptures are well aware. Maleness is a bodily given, but God does not have a body; maleness is sexual, but Yahweh [<em>Jehovah</em>] is not a sexual being. As [<em>the Old Testament scholar</em>] Gerhard von Rad says, 'any thought of sex in him, or of his acting in creation by means of sex, was completely alien to Israel.' There is a distinctly male god prominent in the Hebrew Scriptures: his name is Baal. He was the principle of male fertility.</div></blockquote>
<p>As Old Testament readers will know, sexual activity was all part of Baal worship with its temple prostitutes. But this was totally absent from Jewish worship. However, God is always masculine in the Bible and with the following consequences. To quote Podles again:</p>
<blockquote><div>He transcends creation: it is not part of him, nor did it come out of him – he spoke, and it was. God is, therefore, utterly separate from creation; that is, he is holy … though God transcends his creation, he loves it and is involved with it. A transcendent God is a masculine God; a feminine or bisexual God is an immanent God, one who is part of creation or the creation is part of him-her. Such an immanent deity is not holy (separate), and does not demand holiness, that is separation from the standards of the natural world. A god who was one with creation would not be Yahweh.</div></blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, this separation of the creature from the masculine Creator is at the root of "liberty" for it entails the granting of human freedom. But such liberty allows for disobedience to God. However, such a masculine God who is separate from his creatures can love them with the love seen in the Old Testament. That is, God loves absolutely freely. For it is not an inevitable just response to good deeds, since the God of the Bible loves sinners. Nor is it the love of a goddess giving birth to its creatures, where there is instinct at work rather than freedom. However, the love of the God of the Bible is truly unmerited love.</p>
<p>Genesis 1-3 has a lot to say about this grant of freedom and the "man" and the "woman". The distinction between the un-fallen man and woman is real and good. But this freedom allows them to disobey God, and they did so. Eve listened to the tempter and was deceived; Adam, then, allowed himself to be ruled by Eve. That was disastrous. For Adam should have rebuked Eve and obeyed God.</p>
<p><strong>Patriarchy</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the Old Testament idea of divine masculinity is related to patriarchy. In the Bible this does not mean exploitation and domination but a system in which fathers care for their families and find emotional satisfaction in their families. Patriarchy has been called "<em>one of the greatest achievements of any religion</em>". It is the counter to "<em>the male tendency to promiscuity and alienation from children and the women who bore them.</em>" That is because it takes a short time for a male to impregnate a female. She then is bound to that developing child not only for nine months but much longer. If fathers are to be involved in the nurture period and beyond, there needs to be a culture of involvement. The Jewish faith was in a God who, unlike the irresponsible gods of Israel's pagan neighbours, did not abandon his own people but cared for them. This then provided the pattern for Jewish patriarchy. Also, with the family being at the very heart of the Jewish way of life, sexual and marital ethics, not surprisingly, is a key concern of the Bible.</p>
<p>The New Testament and Christianity, of course, are fulfilling the Old Testament. The masculinity and the patriarchy that it produced were fulfilled in the revelation of our Trinitarian God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. All human beings, male and female alike, are invited by faith to share in the inner life of God, receive the Spirit and be conformed to the Son (not the Daughter). And Leon Podles adds this:</p>
<blockquote><div>The God and Father of Jesus Christ is the same God as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Although Gnosticism [one of the first heresies] has enjoyed a rebirth in the attempts to oppose an androgynous Jesus to the patriarchal Jehovah, such an interpretation must be ruled out at the start. From the very beginning, Christianity distinguished itself from Gnosticism; the God of the Old Testament is not the devil of the New Testament. The Jesus who walked the roads of Galilee is the same person as the risen Lord and Christ. His male body is risen from the dead; the masculinity of the Son reveals the Father [and] the First Person [of the Trinity] is called Father by the only one who truly knows him, Jesus. The First Person is Father. Indeed, Father specifies what he is, because he eternally begets the Son. Paul rejects the idea that the Father is a religious projection of patriarchal social structures. The reverse is true. The Father is the model, and created fatherhood is the image. So Paul says, "I pray, kneeling before the Father, from whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth takes its name'" (Ephesians 3.15 - NJB).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we must listen to Jesus himself, who said: "<em>When you pray, say: 'Father, hallowed be your name'</em>" (Luke 11.2 - ESV). So to call God, "Mother" instead of "Father", or to refer to "him" as "her" is surely the opposite of "hallowing" God's name of Father. If so, it is both blasphemous and idolatrous.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Devil and All His Works">(August 2015) The Devil and All His Works</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2015</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>The Unfashionable Belief in the Devil</em></p>
<p>Do we believe that the Devil is real and, indeed, personal? A lot of people claiming to be Christian have given up that belief.</p>
<p>In the BCP 1662 (the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> - old but still a standard for Anglican doctrine) there is a Catechism. It is subtitled "<em>an instruction to be learned of every person before he be brought to be confirmed by the Bishop</em>". And the first doctrinal question asks about what was promised, on the candidates behalf, by "<em>your Godfathers and Godmothers</em>". The answer is to be: "<em>First, that I should renounce the devil and all his works.</em>" However, when a revision of the Prayer Book was discussed in the mid 20th century, "<em>the devil and all his works</em>" were omitted from the revised Catechism. Thankfully this revision was never included in the revised 1980 Alternative Services Book. In that book there was still the encouragement in the Baptism service to "<em>fight valiantly under the banner of Christ against sin, the world and the devil</em>". However, in the latest revision there is a reference to the devil that may (or may not) be used.</p>
<p>At our July Day of Prayer, I was asked to say a few words on financial needs. My first point was that we must be thankful, as <em>"in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving"</em> we are to <em>"make our requests known to God"</em> (Philippians 4.5). So I said we must begin at JPC by thanking God for the amazing giving for St Joseph's over 2013-2014; however, as at the same time our regular giving for JPC decreased over that same period, we still need to pray for significant financial resources. But I concluded with two references to the Devil:</p>
<blockquote><div>I know that many will have already given sacrificially over this period. They can't give any more. But they can pray … I am sure the Devil wants us to lose our focus just when things are about to happen for God's glory and this city's good. He wants us to forget that our God … <em>is able to do far more abundantly than all we ask or think, according to the power at work within us</em> (Eph 3.20). And the Devil will want us, therefore, to forget that simple principle in James 4.2-4: <em>you do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions</em> [or selfish desires].</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Modern doubts and Jesus' confidence</em></p>
<p>But do we really believe that the Devil will be attacking us because we are working and giving for going multi-site for the sake of the gospel? I have been thinking about the Devil recently in regard not only to JPC but the wider world; and I am very conscious of the intellectual and theological fashions that make it difficult to persuade people of the reality of the demonic. So what are these fashions? According to <em>A Dictionary of Christian Theology</em> that was published in 1969 (and more conservative than many, I may say) it said this in its article on "Satan":</p>
<blockquote><div>Until the age of Enlightenment [17th and 18th centuries and the so called 'Age of Reason'] belief in an objectivized personal Devil and his minions was all but universal among theologians. Today, however, it is generally recognized that belief in Satan, the leader of the fallen angels etc. is not a satisfactory answer to the problem of evil: it still leaves us asking the question how evil got into the world which God created and saw was 'very good'. But as a pictorial way of representing the existence of superhuman evil forces in the universe, Satan and his hosts call our attention to a very important question for theology."Alan Richardson</div></blockquote>
<p>And that view still seems the case among many clergy. For 30 years later, the encyclopaedic <em>Oxford Companion to Christian Thought</em> (published in 2000) says this in its article on "The Devil": "<em>If there is no 'personal' devil, as most modern Christian thinkers would probably claim, what, others enquire, are we saved from?</em>" However, the article's author, Adrian Hastings, concedes "<em>that the 'devil', shorthand for evil at its most potent, truly exists.</em>"</p>
<p>But Jesus is so clear on the personal nature of the Devil. When in dialogue with hostile Jews who were seeking to kill him, he said (John 8.42-45):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He </em>[emphasized by a Greek masculine personal pronoun]<em> was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Of course, care needs to taken when thinking about the devil and demonic activity. As C. S. Lewis famously wrote in his preface to <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>:</p>
<blockquote><div>There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.</div></blockquote>
<p><em>The Catechism of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA)</em></p>
<p>So what should we believe about the Devil? Let me quote from the new ACNA Catechism entitled "<em>To be a Christian</em>". It says the following regarding the Lord's Prayer and the Seventh Petition, "But deliver us from evil". This is helpful:-</p>
<p><strong>What is evil?</strong> Evil is the wilful perversion of God's good will that defies his holiness and mars his good creation (Genesis 3.1-19; 4.1-8; 6.1-8).</p>
<p><strong>If God made the world good at its creation, why does he permit evil?</strong> God made rational creatures free to worship, love, and obey him, but also free to reject his love, rebel against him, and choose evil – as the human race has done. (Genesis 6.5; Ecclesiastes 7.29; 1 Timothy 1.20; Revelation 2.18-29)</p>
<p><strong>Did evil exist before the human race embraced it?</strong> Yes. Satan and the other demons with him had already opposed God and chosen evil. (Genesis 3.1-5; Job 1.6-12; John 8.44)</p>
<p><strong>What are Satan and demons?</strong> Demons, of whom Satan is chief, are fallen angels. Satan rebelled against God and led other angels to follow him. They now cause spiritual and sometimes physical harm to mortals, and they sow lies that lead to confusion, despair, sin and death. (Luke 11.14-26; 8.29; 9.39; John 8.44; 2 Corinthians 2.11;4.3-4; 11.3; 12.7; Revelation 12.7-12)</p>
<p><strong>How did Satan and his angels turn to evil?</strong> Satan and his angels were overcome by envy and pride and rebelled against God. (Luke 10.18; 1 Timothy 3.6; Revelation 12.7-12)</p>
<p><strong>What are angels?</strong> Angels are spiritual, holy beings created by God. They joyfully serve him in heavenly worship and God appoints them to act as messengers, bringing words of guidance and assurance to the faithful, and assisting and protecting them. (Psalm 148.1-6 ; Hebrews 1.14; Luke 1.19, 26-33; Acts 8.26-28; 12.7-11; 27.23-24)</p>
<p><strong>How did God address evil in this world?</strong> God, in his love, sent Jesus Christ to gain victory over all the powers of evil by his death, resurrection and ascension. Victory and authority over sin and evil are granted to the faithful in their daily lives through the Holy Spirit by the blood of Jesus shed on the cross. God will finally overcome all evil, including death, at the end of the age. (John 3.16; Colossians 2.13-15; Luke 10.17-20; Philippians 2.10; 1 John 4.4; Romans 8.28, 35-39; Revelation 21.1-4)</p>
<p><strong>Is God responsible for evil?</strong> No. The free choices of his creatures do not implicate God in evil in any way. (Galatians 2.17; James 1.13-15)</p>
<p><strong>How does God redeem evil?</strong> Though the evil deeds of his creatures may cause great harm and suffering, the almighty and all-wise God can use them to bring about his good purposes, both in the world and in my life (Genesis 50.20; Romans 8.28)</p>
<p><strong>From what evil do you seek to be delivered?</strong> I desire, first and foremost, to be delivered from Satan our Enemy, the Evil One, and all demonic forces that seek to destroy God's creatures. (Matthew 16.21-23; John 13.27; 1 Peter 5.8-9)</p>
<p><strong>From what other evil do you seek deliverance?</strong> I ask my heavenly Father to protect me from the world and the flesh, and to deliver me from the dangers of the day and night; from sin, sorrow, sickness, and horror; and from everlasting damnation. (The Great Litany, BCP 1662)</p>
<p><strong>How does God deliver you from evil?</strong> God's Holy Spirit transforms my soul to see and hate evil as he does; then he further delivers me either by removing my trial or by giving me strength to endure it gracefully. (Psalms 1; 23; 1 Corinthians 10.13; 2 Corinthians 12.9-10; Philippians 4.13)</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Cultures of Life, Death and Suicide">(September 2015) Cultures of Life, Death and Suicide</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2015</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>Rob Marris MP has brought the 'Assisted Dying' Bill as a Private Members Bill before the House of Commons. This Bill had earlier been proposed by Lord Falconer in the House of Lords but ran out of time during the last Parliament. The vote on this Bill is to take place on Friday 11 September 2015. The following are some reasons for encouraging our MPs to vote against the Bill. The Church of England's official briefing (toward the end of this paper) is from the Coloured Supplement for October 2009. It is worthy of republication and rereading.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus and the culture of life</strong></p>
<p>Not only is our God to be identified with love but also with life. So Jesus, the Divine Son, says: <em>"as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself"</em> (John 5.26). And Jesus says a little later on in John,</p>
<blockquote><div><em>I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die</em> (John 11.25-26).</div></blockquote>
<p>That wonderful fact that Jesus Christ embodies life is behind his great mission on earth to defeat death through conquering sin. And Paul underlines that correlation between Christ and life when he says …</p>
<blockquote><div><em>… as by man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive</em> (1 Corinthians 15.21-22).</div></blockquote>
<p>And Paul can end that great chapter 15 like this:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory. O death, where is your sting?' The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ</em> (1 Corinthians 15.51-57).</div></blockquote>
<p>So not only at Easter time but throughout the year, and particularly this month, we need to focus on the fact that life is of the essence of our God and that Jesus, through his Resurrection, proves that life is of his essence also. For as never before in the West we are having to fight what has been called "a culture of death".</p>
<p>Over the summer of 2015, on the one hand, there have been brutal murders from Islamic religious extremists - the most publicized being on a beach in Sousse, Tunisia. Now, on the other hand, from the opposite secular extreme, there is a different form of the culture of death. It is less publicized, more subtle and evokes, understandably, much sympathy: but it is hugely significant. It is through the promotion of assisted suicide and in the form of the "Assisted Dying" Bill that is to be voted on this month.</p>
<p><strong>The new culture of death</strong></p>
<p>This new culture of death came in during the 1960s and was the result of legal innovations and media initiatives that promoted death through seeking to give the green light to abortions and euthanasia.&nbsp;It plausibly can be argued that it began with the decriminalizing of suicide and so the Suicide Act of 1961. That was achieved by claiming there needed to be a separation of the law from morality. Sadly, many failed to see that such separation of the law from morality meant a separation from Christian morality; and the result would not be neutrality, but the law now joined to a new pagan morality.&nbsp;An able Oxford Law Professor, who promoted the new legislation, was H L A Hart. He began his little 1963 book, Law, Liberty and Morality, with these words:</p>
<blockquote><div>The Suicide Act 1961, though it may directly affect the lives of few people, is something of a landmark in our legal history. It is the first Act of Parliament for at least a century to remove altogether the penalties of the criminal law from a practice both clearly condemned by conventional Christian morality and punishable by law. Many hope that the Suicide Act may be followed by further measures of reform and that certain forms of abortion, homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private, and certain forms of euthanasia will cease to be criminal offences.</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course, suicide is always terribly tragic, always with so many factors involved, always many people affected and always needing compassion and understanding. Hart, however, was not right. The Suicide Act of 1961 still recognized the Christian moral tradition that says suicide is always morally wrong (and that is because of the Sixth Commandment against murder, which includes self-murder and is something not only Christians understand, but also others of good will). The 1961 Act, of course, presupposes that moral tradition in prohibiting assistance for suicides. So it says in section 2(1):</p>
<blockquote><div>a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The awful reality</strong></p>
<p>It is this 1961 offence of "complicity in suicide" some are working to repeal. They want the Government to introduce new legislation making assisted suicide legal. Prior to the recent General Election a letter with 80 signatories appeared to this effect in <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> at the end of December 2014. Among the reasons for allowing assisted suicide was the fact that "currently one Briton a fortnight ends their life in the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland" and that "no one believes that someone should face a prison sentence of 14 years for compassionately assisting a loved one to die."</p>
<p>What the letter did not say was that the only person to have had a serious conviction in recent years was for supplying a person with petrol and a lighter that resulted not in death but in horrific burns. The lack of compassion was the cause of the sentence. Nor did the letter mention the impossible reality placed on NHS doctors if assisted suicide becomes law. Fermand Melgar's 2005 documentary film <em>Exit: Le Droit de Mourir</em> (Exit: the Right to Die) shows the reality for volunteer Swiss suicide "escorts". The leader of the group admits the work is emotionally exhausting, "we have to rest between two missions, recharge our batteries; this is not something you can do as regularly as clockwork … It is an exceptional act, every single time. I am exhausted after every assisted suicide." So says someone committed to killing. How wicked to expect UK medical professionals, committed to saving lives, to kill like these "escorts".</p>
<p>Since that December 2014 letter the debate regarding suicide has widened following what happened at the end of March 2015. That was when Andreas Lubitz, a suicidal co-pilot, locked his captain out of the cockpit of their airliner and flew 149 people into a mountainside in the French Alps at 500 mph killing everyone. The question that can be asked is, "how much the undermining of the Christian moral tradition in Western Europe, namely that suicide is always wrong, affects suicidal thoughts and so suicides?"</p>
<p>Knowing what others think and do about suicide affects the suicidal. For there is a "social contagion" aspect to suicide leading to copycat suicides. Notoriously in 1933 on the Japanese island of Izu Oshima, a 21 year-old female student, Kiyoko Matsumoyo, jumped into the volcano of Mount Mihara from an observation point. Overnight she became a celebrity and 944 people (804 men, 140 women) jumped like she had done into the volcano's crater in 1933 alone.</p>
<p>The basic biblical perspective over the taking of life is clear. God is our creator. Human life is not our 'property' - it is held in trust or on loan from him. We may not, therefore, just 'dispose' of it. As Job said: <em>"The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away"</em> (Job 1.21). Also, as already noted, there is that fundamental prohibition on killing in the Ten Commandments (Ex 20.13). Its basis for it is set out in Genesis 9.6: <em>"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image."</em> Our significance, human dignity and so our claim to protection derives, therefore, not from our "quality of life" or gifts and abilities, but from our status as being made in God's image. So suicide soon came to be seen as wrong in the Church. In the early church Augustine said it was like murdering yourself, so contravening the sixth commandment against murder. In the 16th century one of the Reformed Catechisms similarly said: "the sins forbidden in the sixth commandment" include "all taking away the life of ourselves." But views have varied over culpability. Certainly that ethic, being institutionalized in law, has had practical benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Kheriaty</strong></p>
<p>In his recent paper, Apostolate of Death, Aaron Kheriaty, a Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, argues that, if assisted suicide is permitted, in time it will not be restricted to terminal illness. In Belgium, assisted suicide has been granted to a woman with "untreatable depression". In Holland, where also there is assisted suicide, not wanting to live in a nursing home qualifies for assistance! So, he asks, why not the "merely unhappy, demoralized, dejected, depressed or desperate. If assisted suicide is good, why limit it only to a select few?" (by the way, the only other European countries with assisted suicide are Switzerland and Luxembourg – it is not common in Europe). Kheriaty points out, too, that</p>
<blockquote><div>… suicidal individuals typically do not want to die; they want to escape what they perceive as intolerable suffering. When comfort or relief is offered, in the form of more adequate treatment for depression, better pain management, or more-comprehensive palliative care, the desire for suicide wanes. We know that the vast majority of suicides are associated with clinical depression or other treatable mental disorders; yet alarmingly, less than 6 percent of the 752 reported cases of individuals who have died by assisted suicide under Oregon's law were referred for psychiatric evaluation prior to their death. This constitutes gross medical negligence.</div></blockquote>
<p>Kheriarty also writes about the "social contagion" aspect to suicide in the United States. This seems to be happening in Oregon (one of the few States to have assisted suicide). For following the legalization of physician-assisted suicide in 1997, the 1990s decline in suicide rates was reversed such that there was a significant increase between 2000 and 2010 with the rates now 35% higher than the national average. He also mentions the suicide "hot spot" – the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco …</p>
<blockquote><div>… where fourteen hundred people have died, while only a handful have survived the jump. A journalist tracked down a few of these survivors and asked them what was going through their minds in the four seconds between jumping off the bridge and hitting the water. All of them responded that they regretted the decision to jump, with one saying, 'I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable - except for having just jumped.' This small sample is consistent with larger studies of suicide survivors. Ten years after attempted suicide, nearly all survivors no longer wish to die but are pleased to be alive. To abandon suicidal individuals in the midst of a crisis—under the guise of respecting their autonomy—is socially irresponsible: it undermines sound medical ethics and erodes social solidarity.</div></blockquote>
<p>Kheriarty is clear: "Refusing to legitimate suicide helps those in need. The practice of physician-assisted suicide – by whatever name one calls it – sends a message that some lives are not worth living. The law is a teacher: if assisted suicide is legalized, this message will be heard by everyone who is afflicted by suicidal thoughts or tendencies."</p>
<p><strong>"Assisted Dying/Suicide and Voluntary Euthanasia" – a briefing</strong></p>
<p>The following is a Church of England statement on assisted dying/suicide issued prior to a previous Parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>"While acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia, the Church of England is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice. The Church also acknowledges that those who seek a change in the law are often motivated by compassion and by a desire to see individuals treated with dignity and respect - motives that the Church also upholds. Equally, the Church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, but believes that assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals.</p>
<p>At the heart of this debate is the relationship between two important principles:<br>personal autonomy and the protection of life. Often these principles are complementary but, at times, they compete for priority. The Church believes that personal autonomy has an invaluable role to play in a civilized society but autonomy ought not to be understood or exercised without regard to others. Autonomy ought to be 'principled autonomy'. Our actions affect others both directly and indirectly and this reality ought to place boundaries on unbridled autonomy. In truly extreme cases, protection of life is sometimes impossible to achieve. This does not, however, undermine the importance of this principle or necessitate a change in the law. For Christians, the innate dignity and value of human beings comes from the belief that we are made in the image of God. It is not, of course, necessary to share this religious conviction to agree that every human being is uniquely and equally valuable. Without such a belief, society would degenerate into moral disorder with a social misapplication of 'survival of the fittest' replacing allegiance to our common humanity. Human Rights are built on the foundation of the 'right to life' as is much of the criminal code. Compassionate reactions to natural disasters and to the victims of war stem from a belief in the value of life. There ought always to be a 'presumption in favour of life' and where personal autonomy and protection of life conflict, protection of life ought to be given priority. Society and its agents ought to act to protect life and only where this is truly not tenable, such as in a situation of extreme violence or danger, ought this principle to be breached.</p>
<p>In assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia individuals seek the right to dictate how they may die, requiring doctors and nurses, as the agents of society, either to take life or to assist in the taking of life. Where a right is given, a corresponding obligation to respect, protect and to promote that right must also be acknowledged. A right for one must be a right for all and a right for all can only be upheld by society ensuring that every person has access to that right. An obligation on society and its agents to take life or to assist in the taking of life, by ensuring a universal right to assisted dying/suicide or to voluntary euthanasia, would create a new and unwelcome role for society.</p>
<p><strong>Problems in practice</strong></p>
<p>There are problems ensuring that any law permitting assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia could be sufficiently safe-guarded against abuse. Evidence from jurisdictions that allow assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia suggests that there have, indeed, been problems of ensuring that due process is always carried out and that adequate support services are always in place. As well as there being concerns that one change in the law will lead to further, greater, changes there is an inevitability that any law, however tightly formulated, will be interpreted variously by different people. A reference to 'severe suffering', for example, can only be interpreted subjectively while an estimate of how long a terminally ill person may have to live can only be precisely that - an estimate. Inevitably, doctors will vary in their approach and consistency will be impossible to achieve, with 'wider' interpretations of the law becoming acceptable.</p>
<p>Even with safeguards of mandatory counselling and 'cooling off periods' it is impossible to ensure that vulnerable, terminally ill patients, especially elderly patients without close family support, will not feel under moral, economic or social pressure to accept assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia. What may appear as greater freedom of choice for some can easily become a greater source of pressure for others. One such person is one too many and would represent an affront to them, to health professionals and to society.</p>
<p>It has been a source of comfort and assurance to millions of people that the NHS has provided care and protection as well as life-enhancing and life-saving interventions since its inception over sixty years ago. Trust in the health service is crucial to the health and well-being of individuals and of the population. To introduce assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia into the NHS (for only in this way could the 'right' be made universally accessible) would be to change fundamentally the nature of the NHS. The effects of this are likely to be far-reaching, particularly if assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia were to be perceived as being a 'cost-effective' way of dealing with terminal illness. Also the nature of the doctor and nurse/patient relationship would change fundamentally and irrevocably, if assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia were to become part of the 'treatment' that health professionals were to be able to offer their patients. Trust between doctor/nurse and patient is not always easily achieved; any change in medical or nursing practice in the area of care of the terminally ill is likely to have an adverse effect on such relationships. A 'conscience clause' allowing doctors and nurses to 'opt out' of assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia would often mean that patients would be introduced to new staff unknown to them at a most vulnerable stage in their lives, undermining patient care</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and the effects on Palliative Care</strong></p>
<p>Making assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia 'workable' would require large resources, employing medical, nursing, counselling, legal and social-work staff with accompanying additional training and resources. With all of this, there is still no guarantee that assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia would be safely and fairly administered. In the mean-time, medical palliative care, which has been shown to be highly effective is still not uniformly available throughout the country. The additional psychological, social, family and (where requested) spiritual support services needed to address all of the needs of terminally ill people in a full palliative 'care-package,' are equally under-resourced. What is required is a commitment to making effective support a reality for all terminally ill patients. Suffering may be met with compassion, commitment to high-quality services and effective medication. Meeting it by assisted dying/suicide or through voluntary euthanasia, however well intentioned, is merely removing it in the crudest way possible."</p>
<p>Much more now needs to be said, but on another occasion.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Thinking about Immigrants">(October 2015) Thinking about Immigrants</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2015</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>2nd September 2015</strong></p>
<p>History may record 2nd September 2015 as when the 2015 European immigrant crisis really impacted the hearts and minds of people throughout the world. For that was when a dead child's body (that of Aylan Shenu) was washed up on the shores of Bodrum, southern Turkey and millions saw a photo of a Turkish police officer carrying away the migrant child's dead body in his arms. This was after a boat carrying refugees sank while trying to reach the Greek island of Cos.</p>
<p>As this image of the police officer and dead child went viral around the world through TV, the press and social media, thousands of refugees and migrants arrived in Athens and other European cities; and across Europe there was now desperation as Governments tried to cope with the huge influx of people fleeing war and repression in the Middle East and Africa.&nbsp;So how should Christians think about this crisis? How is the Bible of help? Well, certainly we need to start with its teaching on the "stranger or sojourner".</p>
<p><strong>The "stranger or sojourner"</strong></p>
<p>In the Old Testament the "stranger or sojourner" is someone who is permanently living in what to him or her is a foreign country in terms of their parentage. This is in contrast to the foreigner whose stay is short. The stranger or sojourner is significant in the Old Testament for God's people were themselves "sojourners" in Egypt; and that experience conditioned how the Israelites themselves treated such people when back in their own land (Deut 10.19).&nbsp;These sojourners could either be individuals or they could be a whole tribe like the Gibeonites (Jos 9.3ff) or the remnants of the Canaanite tribes after the Israelites had conquered Canaan. And they were well treated. They were not enslaved. Rather they had a range of privileges.&nbsp;Fundamentally they were not to be oppressed (Ex 22.21). In fact Leviticus chapter 19.33-34 says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>In practical terms there were economic benefits for sojourners. At harvest time some of the field was left for them, and also some grapes in the vineyard (Lev 19.9-10). Then there was the protection of being able to use the cities of refuge (Num 35.15). And, supremely, God would class sojourners along with the fatherless and widow as being defenceless and in need of defending. So God would, indeed, judge their oppressors (Jer 7.6).</p>
<p>The sojourners, however, were not free to ignore all Jewish restraints. They had to avoid leaven during the feast of Unleavened bread; avoid work on the Sabbath and on the Day of Atonement; avoid eating blood; and avoid immorality, idolatry and blasphemy. But a male was not compelled to keep the Passover but could do so if circumcised.&nbsp;So there was a level of integration and assimilation required from sojourners if they wanted to stay in the land.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus' teaching and the New Testament</strong></p>
<p>In the New Testament we read that Jesus endorsed this Old Testament care for the stranger or sojourner in his final Parable in Matthew's Gospel (the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats) that is on the final judgment. In this he says that on that Judgment Day …</p>
<blockquote><div><em>before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>The goats are the ones he condemns, while the sheep are the ones he commends, among other things, for <em>"welcoming strangers"</em> when the stranger is <em>"one of the least of these my brothers"</em> – that is to say, one of Jesus' followers. For, said Jesus, it was as though <em>"you did it</em> [offered that welcome] <em>to me"</em> (Mat 25.33ff); but failing to offer such welcome would incur fearful judgment.&nbsp;Then there is the Pauline teaching that the Christian should <em>"do good to everyone and especially to those who are of the household of faith"</em> (Gal 6.10). So in accordance with that instruction the Christian tradition has extended this care for the stranger to <em>"everyone"</em> while especially caring for Christian believers.</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary responses</strong></p>
<p>In the light of this biblical teaching regarding Christian "strangers and sojourners" it is good, therefore, that the Archbishop of Canterbury has challenged the Government's refugee policy as discriminating against Christians who are facing persecution. The Church Times reported (18 September 2015):</p>
<blockquote><div>in a private meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday, Archbishop Welby warned that Christians were likely to be excluded from the 20,000 refugees who were scheduled to come to the UK in the next five years, because of Mr Cameron's decision to take refugees directly from UN camps in Syria and bordering countries. Many Syrian Christians avoided the camps for fear of religious persecution … In a speech in the House of Lords on Monday, Archbishop Welby said that the Christian population had been 'forced to flee' from rogue Islamist groups.</div></blockquote>
<p>Surely such neglect of genuine Christian refugees and asylum seekers is particularly serious in the light of Jesus' teaching in Matthew 25 that failing to welcome one of his followers when a stranger will incur divine judgment!&nbsp;But then in the light of all the biblical teaching Christians are arguing that obviously we must show compassion to these hundreds of thousands of people risking life and limb to escape from what they consider to be intolerable situations. In August it was reported by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) that the number of refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe in 2015 was over 300,000 – up from 219,000 in the whole of 2014. And this year over 2,500 have died trying to make the crossing.</p>
<p>However, Canon J.John helpfully insists that in this discussion we need to add four "I's" to compassion. They are to be <em>involved</em> (as we are able), to be <em>intelligent</em> (in our analysis of the problems), to have <em>integrity</em> (in being honest and facing uncomfortable facts), and, essentially, to <em>intercede</em> (be praying).</p>
<p><strong>Immigration and an uncomfortable fact</strong></p>
<p>One uncomfortable fact, too often ignored, is that Europe has a declining population through low fertility. According to the UN over the next 15 years to 2030 there will be a slow decline in Europe of 4 million (from 738 million to 734 million). Then the next 20 years sees a more dramatic decline of 27 million (to 707 million).&nbsp;However, one of the lessons of modern social science is that no wealthy, industrialized nation can prop up its fertility rate without large-scale immigration. It needs such immigration to survive economically.</p>
<p>It is always difficult talking about "low fertility". For at the same time as there are such demographic problems, there are always some who are desperate to have children, but for one reason or another cannot have them. So for them the discussion is painful. But it is such a serious problem that it must be addressed. Other people react negatively to discussions about fertility because they think it is a "right wing" concern and they are of the "left" in politics.</p>
<p>Then there are yet others (politicians on both right and left) who will only think in 5 year spans and the next General Election and how to remain in power. But policies regarding fertility relate to 10-30 years ahead, need to be tough and may lose votes. 10-30 years ahead is when the oldest generation with replacement levels of fertility dies off. Until then there is an illusion of well-being as the population continues to grow. But after that low fertility really has serious consequences.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Guardian Weekly</em></strong></p>
<p>Currently, however, it is the left wing that has been alerting people to these consequences. The <em>Guardian Weekly</em> leading article for the beginning of September 2015 was headlined "Europe in need of a baby boom". The sub-headings were, "Birthrate fall is a threat to economic prosperity" and "Immigration could avert population disaster".&nbsp;It then outlined the fact that some European countries are in a very serious condition, including Germany. It reports that</p>
<blockquote><div>the UN predicts that, by 2030, the percentage of Germans in the workplace will drop 7% to just 54%; this is despite a strong influx of young migrant labourers. To offset this shortage, Germany needs to welcome an average of 533,000 immigrants every year, which gives context to the estimate that 800,000 refugees are due to come to Germany this year.</div></blockquote>
<p>It is generally agreed that replacement fertility level is an average of 2.1 children for every woman of child bearing age. The UN's latest figures are that the European Union's average is only 1.6, the lowest in the world. However, there are wide variances within Europe. The UN says that Portugal is 1.28, Spain is 1.32, Greece and Hungary are 1.34, Poland is 1.37, Germany is 1.39, Italy is 1.43, the Czech Republic is 1.45; Russia is 1.66, the UK is 1.92 and France is 2.00 (with regard to those last two figures it needs to be noted that the UK's exceptionalism is due to the large number of births to immigrant mothers).&nbsp;The seriousness of the situation is particularly evident in Portugal. The <em>Guardian Weekly</em> reports that in real terms Portugal's population could drop from 10.5 million to 6.3 million by 2060; and it reports that in Spain the charity Democratic Renaissance claims,</p>
<blockquote><div>Most people think we're only talking about something that will be a problem in 50 years, but we're already seeing part of the problem. If current numbers hold, every new generation of Spaniards will be 40% smaller than the previous one.</div></blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly the Prime Minister of Portugal, Pedro Coelho, has called on the EU to make falling birthrates a priority in the next five years. A Portuguese Commission claims that a failure to reverse the demographic crisis could leave Portugal "unsustainable in terms of economic growth, social security and the welfare state." And it is the same with Italy where there are plans for a "baby bonus". So the <em>Guardian Weekly</em> concludes:</p>
<blockquote><div>across huge swaths of the European Union, longstanding communities are disappearing and the social burden on the young is becoming unsustainable. Meanwhile Cos, Lampedusa and on the Hungarian border, tens of thousands plead to be allowed in.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Integration not Multiculturalism</strong></p>
<p>But there is another fundamental hard fact to be faced once the hard fact of the demographic deficit is faced and the need for immigrants admitted. That is the need for integration and assimilation of immigrants and not unfettered multiculturalism.&nbsp;For if the immigrants have an aggressive religion and so aggressive culture (with religion at the heart of culture), the host's culture will be gradually shaped by the immigrants' religion and, in the case of European countries, lose those cultural distinctives for which the immigrants have emigrated in the first place – namely peace, good order and freedom!</p>
<p>The hard fact is that multiculturalism is the inevitable consequence of a host's own relativistic culture where there is no absolute right or wrong (such as with the secularism of many Europeans). But such multiculturalism will not defeat a militant religious culture (such as Islamic extremism). For multiculturalism means that no one culture is normative for a society. However a society cannot hold together without some common values or the 'collective conscience' of the society.&nbsp;The sociologist, Peter Berger, puts it like this:</p>
<blockquote><div>Without those shared values, a society begins to disintegrate because the behavioural choices of individuals become completely arbitrary. Morality becomes a matter of idiosyncratic preference and ceases to be subject to public argument: 'You think that slavery is okay; I don't. You have the right to your opinion. I won't be judgmental. I won't try to impose my views on you.' …Relativism, with its individual rather than collective morality, is an invitation to nihilism. It can also be described as decadence – defined as a situation in which the norms that hold a society together have been hollowed out, have become illusionary and likely risible, and (most important) have undermined the trust that other people will behave in accordance with collectively shared norms. A decadent society doesn't have much of a future: it lacks the will to defend itself even against very real dangers to its very existence.</div></blockquote>
<p>There has to be integration and assimilation, but with cultural distinctives except where they are contrary, in the case of Britain, to British values. These (democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs) are only sustainable with the assumption of the values of "truth" and the "Christian tradition" (see <em><a href="http://www.clayton.tv/find/explore/239-212/0i0/1553/">British Values: Jesmond Conference '15</a>)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The recovery of the Gospel</strong></p>
<p>So how should the Christian respond to the immigration crisis? We should show compassion but not only compassion. We need also to be <em>involved</em>, be <em>intelligent</em>, with <em>integrity</em> and be <em>interceding</em>.</p>
<p><em>Involvement</em> means we should seek to do good to all immigrants who come our way.&nbsp;In the public realm <em>intelligence</em> means we should have a concern for a settlement of immigrants in Europe such that a host country and an immigrant community can both live <em>"a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way"</em> (1 Tim 2.2).&nbsp;<em>Integrity</em> means that we face the fact of the Christian tradition of Europe and the fact that a large number of immigrants will be Muslim, many of whom will be law abiding citizens, but some, sadly, may be "extreme" and potentially violent. Christians among the immigrants, therefore, should especially be protected and enabled freely to witness to, and live for, Christ amongst their fellow immigrants. A commitment to such religious freedom and the freedom to convert should be a condition of entry for migrants.</p>
<p>But most important of all is intercession. We should pray for practical wisdom for the leaders of the European nations in handling the immigration crisis.&nbsp;We should pray for peace in the Middle East to stem the tide of refugees.&nbsp;We should pray for a revival of the Christian faith in Europe; among other things the consequential return to Christian marital and sexual ethics would reduce the demographic deficit.&nbsp;We should pray for our part on Tyneside in that revival.&nbsp;And we should pray for the growth of our own International work at JPC. This already is a wonderful live demonstration that you can be multicultural (without multiculturalism) and enjoy the richness of each other's cultures without conflict. But that is assured if, and only if, <em>"you are all one in Christ Jesus"</em> (Gal 3.28).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Paris, Jihadism and The Battle For Hearts and Minds">(December 2015) Paris, Jihadism and The Battle For Hearts and Minds</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2015</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>13 November 2015</strong></p>
<p>On Friday evening, 13 November, I switched on the TV to the <em>BBC News</em> channel only to see French riot police in Paris hunting terrorists after they had killed 129 people and injured 352.&nbsp;As the weekend 14-15 November progressed, ISIS claimed responsibility for the evening's carnage on that Friday. Among other things the ISIS statement claimed to be targeting …</p>
<blockquote><div> … the capital of prostitution and obscenity, the carrier of the banner of the cross [<em>i.e. the leading 'Crusader</em>] in Europe — Paris. [<em>They also targeted</em>] the Bataclan Conference Centre, where hundreds of apostates had gathered in a profligate prostitution party, and other areas in the 10th and 11th and 18th [<em>arrondissements</em>] ... So Paris shook under their feet, and its streets were tight upon them, and the result of the attacks was the death of no less than 100 Crusaders and the wounding of more than those, and unto Allah is all praise and gratitude. [<em>And there were more threats for…</em> ] as long as they lead the convoy of the Crusader campaign, and dare to curse our Prophet (Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) [<em>i.e. presumably a reference to Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine</em>], and are proud of fighting Islam in France and striking the Muslims in the land of the Caliphate with their planes… This attack is the first of the storm and a warning to those who wish to learn.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>French response</strong></p>
<p>The following Monday, 16 November, the French President, M. Hollande, speaking to his country's congress, claimed "France is at war!" He said:</p>
<blockquote><div>These attacks were war. It was an attack against our values, against our youth and our way of life … Since the beginning of the year, this organization [<em>ISIS</em>] has attacked Paris, Denmark, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Libya. Every single day they massacre and oppress people. That is the reason why we need to destroy ISIS … On Thursday aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle will go to the Eastern Mediterranean, and that will treble our capacity for action … Faced with acts of war committed on our territory, after the attacks in January [on Charlie Hebdo] and so many other crimes in the past few years in the name of this jihadist ideology, we must have no pity. They're French people who, on Friday, killed other French people. In our country there are people who go from delinquency to radicalization to terrorism … We want to respond with cold determination that's appropriate to this appalling attack. Our democracy has triumphed over far worse adversaries than these cowardly assassins.</div></blockquote>
<p>But is all this simply a matter of going "from delinquency to radicalization to terrorism?" And will it be resolved by more intensive aerial bombardment of ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq?</p>
<p>Clearly Western governments have a duty to protect the lives and property of their citizens. This, according to the apostle Paul, is to enable each person to "<em>lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way</em>" (1 Tim 2.2); and Paul adds as an incentive for action and prayer the fact that "<em>this is good</em> [something all people of goodwill recognize] <em>and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth</em> [something to encourage Christians]" (1 Tim 2.3-4).</p>
<p><strong>The Christian response</strong></p>
<p>What, therefore, should the Christian response be to ISIS? Surely Christians should be concerned for justice and justification – for "<em>the State in the use of the temporal sword against evildoers</em> (Rom. 13:4) <em>and … the Church in the use of the sword of the Spirit</em> [i.e. the Bible] <em>against sin and death and the devil</em> (Eph. 6.17)" to quote the ethicist and theologian Russell Moore. The State should execute justice in respect of violent individuals who destroy, rape, shoot and behead innocent people. The Church should pray and work for those individuals caught up in such horrendous activity to be converted to Jesus Christ and so justified by faith in the God who forgives through the Cross of Christ all types of sin. So the mission of the State and the mission of the Church are both necessary.</p>
<p>But the State must execute justice justly. That means any warlike activity must conform to the "just war" tradition, as worked out over Christian centuries. But one aspect of justice in war is that any necessary violence must have a good chance of success. Acts of blind vengeance that will not lead to success or are unnecessary are, therefore, wrong.</p>
<p>However, to be successful in the current situation, restraint or elimination of ISIS requires a proper understanding of the rise of modern Jihadism and so the appeal of groups like ISIS – something the secularized (and sexualized) consciousness of many in the West finds very difficult. For, as we shall see, Jihadism is to be understood as religious extremism attacking secular extremism. And, as is being increasingly seen, the issues to be addressed are at the level of ideas and religious belief and not just in terms of the courts, the police and the armed forces – necessary and essential as they are.</p>
<p><strong>The issues</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is that the modern world is not secularizing, as many thought. The standard Western belief was this: following the rise of science in the 17th Century, then the 18th Century age of atheistic or deist "enlightenment", and then the 19th Century industrial revolution and colonial expansion, the 20th Century would see the demise of religion and the triumph of a truly godless, secular world order; and this would be ruled by all-knowing and all-wise philosopher scientists.</p>
<p>But since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the triumph of the liberal West, things have turned out very differently. True, Francis Fukuyama wrote in 1992 <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em> – with liberal democracy forming the Holy Grail that would produce health, wealth and happiness for everyone. So Europe could expect a new dawn of freedom and prosperity. But that confidence was short lived. For a cold dose of realism came in 1996 with Samuel Huntington's <em>The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</em>. This book reflected the fact that reality was not producing this secular utopian dream. Far from religion declining, religion was growing in the new world order and particularly the appeal of "<em>new assertive forms of religious activism and belonging</em>" (Lamin Sanneh). That was because in the changes and challenges of modernity and urbanization, religion was providing people with stability and answers to life's questions in a way modern secularism could not.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact – to take just Christianity and Islam - that in 1900 the world population was 1.6 billion with Muslims 200 million and Christians 600 million, together 50% of the world's population. In 1970 the world population was 3.7 billion with Muslims 600 million and Christians 1.2 billion, together 49% of the world's population. But in 2013 with the world's population now being 7.1 billion, Muslims were 1.6 billion and Christians 2.4 billion, together an increase to 56% of the world's population. So as the West was becoming more secularized following the cultural, moral and spiritual revolution of the 1960s, far from the growth of the Church and Islam declining, both have grown worldwide. At the same time certainly the "liberal" elements in the churches that have wanted to become secularized have declined, while the conservative elements have grown. All this has led to books with titles like <em>The Desecularization of the World – Resurgent Religion and World Politics</em>. As Peter Berger wrote in that book in 1999:</p>
<p>"<em>if we really lived in a highly secularized world, then religious institutions could be expected to survive to the degree that they managed to adapt to secularity. That has been the empirical assumption of adaption strategies. What has in fact occurred is that, by and large, religious communities have survived and even flourished to the degree that they have not tried to adapt themselves to the alleged requirements of a secularized world.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>The exception</strong></p>
<p>The great exception to this desecularizing trend is Western Europe together with a globalized band of intelligentsia, whose culture Berger describes as being carried …</p>
<blockquote><div> … by a variety of vehicles: academic networks, foundations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), some governmental and intergovernmental agencies. It … seeks to create markets throughout the world, but the products it promotes are not those of multinational corporations but the ideas and behaviours invented by Western (mostly American) intellectuals, such as the ideologies of human rights, feminism, environmentalism, and multiculturalism, as well as the politics and lifestyles that embody theses ideologies.</div></blockquote>
<p>The result of these developments is that the modern world is not secularized, but pluralized. This pluralization of ideas and beliefs comes through new electronic media as people are bombarded with a plethora of ideas and beliefs and through an education where religious texts are taught not to be believed as true or false but as poetry to be approached aesthetically. This leads to relativism, where nothing is true or right, but just a matter of preference. This then leads to reactions of various sorts, for relativism cannot be endured for long. Emile Durkeim was surely right when he said that a society cannot hold together without some common values (which he called the "collective conscience" of society). Otherwise morality, including marriage, sex and family ethics, becomes merely a matter of preference; and it is not subject to public argument or reason. So "might" becomes the only arbiter of what is right or wrong and decided by who can shout the loudest or who has the best guns. Again to quote Berger:</p>
<blockquote><div>Relativism, with its individual rather than collective morality, is an invitation to nihilism. It can also be described as decadence – defined as a situation in which the norms that hold a society together have been hollowed out, have become illusionary and likely risible, and (most important) have undermined the trust that other people will behave in accordance with collectively shared norms. A decadent society doesn't have much of a future: it lacks the will to defend itself even against very real dangers to its very existence.</div></blockquote>
<p>It is in the light of this "decadence" that violent Islamic extremism needs to be considered. The genealogy of modern Islamic extremism (or totalitarian Jihadism) goes back to the Wahabi movement of Arabia and the Mahdi movement in the Sudan (and the battle of Omdurman) in the late 19th Century. These proto extremists or totalitarians were resisting what they considered the corruption of Islam by Shiites, Sufis and others, who were reckoned unfaithful to the traditions (the sunna) of the Prophet Mohammed. Their view, along with that of other conservative movements in other religions, was that, as James Davison Hunter puts it, <em>"it was the degeneration of these faiths that had created conditions conducive to a foreign domination that only intensified the degradation of the faith and their cultures."</em></p>
<p><strong>Sayyid Qutb</strong></p>
<p>But this Islamic extremism has only affected the West since the second half of the 20th Century. Undoubtedly of great influence has been Sayyid Qutb, a Godfather of the current Islamic extremism. He was an Egyptian intellectual, who, as Hunter puts it, "<em>more than anyone else, theorized the rationale for contemporary Islamic radicalism.</em>" In his short book Milestones he summarizes his thinking. For example, Qutb wrote:</p>
<blockquote><div>Mankind today is on the brink of a precipice, not because of the danger of complete annihilation which is hanging over its head – this being just a symptom and not the real disease – but because humanity is devoid of those vital values which are necessary not only for its healthy development but also for its real progress. Even the Western world realizes that Western civilization is unable to present any healthy values for the guidance of mankind. It knows that it does not possess anything which will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence … If we look at the sources and foundations of modern ways of living, it becomes clear that the whole world is steeped in Jahiliyya [<em>i.e. pagan ignorance of divine guidance</em>]; and all the marvellous material comforts and high-level inventions do not diminish this ignorance. This Jahiliyya is based on rebellion against God's sovereignty on earth; it transfers to man one of the greatest attributes of God, namely sovereignty, and makes some men lords over others. It is now not in that simple and primitive form of the ancient Jahiliyya, but takes the form of claiming that the right to create values, to legislate rules of collective behavior, and to choose any way of life rests with men, without regard to what God has prescribed. The result of this rebellion against the authority of God is the oppression of his creatures …The Islamic civilization can take various forms in its material and organizational structure, but the principles and values on which it is based are eternal and unchangeable. These are: the worship of God alone, the foundation of human relationships on the belief in the Unity of God, the supremacy of the humanity of man over material things, the development of human values and the control of animalistic desires, respect for the family, the assumption of the vice-regency of God on earth according to his guidance and instruction, and in all affairs of this vice-regency, the rule of God's law [al-Shari'a] and the way of life prescribed by him … </div></blockquote>
<p>So when President Hollande said the attack of Friday, 13 November, "<em>was an attack against our values … and our way of life,</em>" he was right. But the hard reality is that those French values and that French way of life no longer have the attraction they once had. This has to be understood to counter ISIS.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, and sadly, on a Friday night in most major cities of the Western world, there will be many young people for whom the whole week has been endured because of that Friday night. That is when they can get, in the vernacular, "wasted", or dance to decadent lyrics, or, for many, sleep with a person only just met. But at some point more and more are waking up the following morning thinking there must be something more to life than orgiastic experiences. And with many of the churches having "adapted" to the culture and no longer having a clear message, Qutb and his like have a ready hearing.</p>
<p>But while Qutb's analysis of Western decadence "rings bells", his solutions are quite unacceptable. From his chapter on "<em>Jihad in the cause of God</em>" you can see how easily current extremists could justify their violence. So it may well be that the young people who join Jihadist groups like ISIS, shocked by, or in numbing reaction to, the decadence of Western society, join only to find a hideous violence in their new "preference" they may not have expected.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
<p>Facts have to be faced. Islam is so varied. Many Muslims are truly horrified at what groups like ISIS say and do. Many are wanting radical changes in Islam; and many want to "adapt" Islam to the modern world. Christians will be cautious about such "adaptation" but, of course, support every attempt to change in a more peaceful direction; and they will pray that Muslims, who from the <em>Quran</em>, recognize Jesus as a prophet, will go on to the New Testament to learn about him more fully, and then trust him as the divine Saviour and Lord.</p>
<p>But a solution demands a change not only on the part of Islam but on the part of the West. The West has to insist that for all the pluralization of the modern world, truth questions must be (peacefully) addressed. For while all (or many) ideas and beliefs must be respected and tolerated, obviously not all ideas and beliefs are equally true. That, I am convinced, will mean the West and Europe in particular have to return to their Christian roots. So I will conclude with some words from the Old Testament prophet, Jeremiah, that are as relevant for today as they were centuries ago when, as today, people had spiritually lost their way:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for unjust gain; and from prophet to priest everyone deals falsely. They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying 'peace, peace', when there is no peace. Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown," says the Lord. Thus says the Lord: "stand by the roads, and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls" </em>(Jer 6.13-16).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="John Newton's New Year Challenge">(January 2016) John Newton's New Year Challenge</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2016</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>John Newton</strong></p>
<p>In the Parish Church of Olney in Buckinghamshire is a plaque to John Newton, written by himself, that reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>John Newton, Clerk,once an infidel and libertine,a servant of slaves in Africa wasby the rich mercy of ourLORD and SAVIOUR, JESUS CHRISTpreserved, restored, pardonedand appointed to preach the faith hehad long laboured to destroynear 16 years as curate of this parishand 28 years as Rector of St Mary Woolnoth.</div></blockquote>
<p>John Newton was a remarkable man. He is now known through the 2006 film, Amazing Grace. This was a biographical drama about the campaign against the slave trade in the British Empire, led by William Wilberforce. The film's title, however, is a reference to Newton's hymn which is now even more famous than its author and sung (remarkably in the secular Western world) on all sorts of public occasions and before thousands. As many know, the first verse of the hymn is:</p>
<blockquote><div>Amazing grace, how sweet the soundthat saved a wretch like me.I once was lost, but now am found,was blind but now I see.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Historical background</strong></p>
<p>An introduction to a recent edition of Newton's letters gives some context to his life and work (Newton being born in 1725 and dying in 1807):</p>
<blockquote><div>In the first half of the 18th century, England was in a state of religious and moral decay. For many years the land had been sinking into darkness and paganism. Intemperance and immorality, crime and cruelty were increasingly becoming the characteristics of the age. The national church was in such a dead condition that instead of being salt, preserving the nation from corruption, she was only adding to the immorality by weakening the restraints which Christianity imposed on the lusts of men. … If the nation were to be saved the church would first have to be revived. And that is what took place. What the arm of flesh could not do the arm of omnipotence accomplished. God was pleased to send a mighty revival, which in the course of fifty years transformed the religious and moral life of England. … Some of the leaders are well known to us, such as George Whitefield and John Wesley. They were the early leaders in the awakening and, because of their widespread labours, overshadowed such eminent contemporaries as William Grimshaw, John Berridge, Daniel Rowland, and William Romaine. As the revival movement spread, a second generation of leaders emerged. Chief among them was John Newton, the once infidel mariner and servant of slaves, who became through the grace of God, a humble Christian and devoted minister to Christ."Introduction, <em>Letters of John Newton</em>, Banner of Truth Trust, Edinburgh, 2007 (pp.vii-viii)</div></blockquote>
<p>Newton was not a great preacher like Whitefield and Wesley but he was a greater pastor, personal worker and spiritual guide, especially through his letters and hymns. He had a great facility with words. His writings are said to "excel in practical instruction for Christian living. His concern was to encourage true Christian character and conformity to Christ." The great Victorian preacher Charles Spurgeon said of Newton and his letters that "in few writers are Christian doctrine, experience and practice more happily balanced than in the author of these letters, and few write with more simplicity, piety and force."</p>
<p><strong>Newton and Wilberforce</strong></p>
<p>If John Newton was chief or, at least, one of the chief leaders of the second generation of the revival movement, William Wilberforce, the hero of the anti-slavery movement, was another of that band. But Newton was a significant spiritual influence on Wilberforce, whom, because of his own personal background, he could influence in the fight against the slave trade. For during an, at times, utterly decadent and aggressively godless youth (the "infidel" and "libertine" of his epitaph), Newton had himself been involved in the slave trade. John Pollock writes: "The old ex-slave trader and the young statesman became firm friends, and whenever they were together Newton used to harp on his shame about the Trade." In fact, had it not been for Newton and others who helped stop him, Wilberforce would have become a clergyman instead of a politician.</p>
<p>So by Easter 1786, when Newton was 45 and the 28 year-old Wilberforce was clear on what he should do, Newton wrote to his friend, the poet Cowper: "I judge he is decidedly on the right track … I hope the Lord will make him a blessing both as a Christian and a statesman. How seldom do these characters coincide! But they are not incompatible."</p>
<p><strong>Life and conversion</strong></p>
<p>As a young man Newton had learnt about life the hard way! Between 1736 (aged 11) and 1742 (aged 17) he had gone to sea with his father (his mother having died when he was 7). Then soon after began his slave trading. The Trade was unbelievably appalling. Captured Africans were, like animals, chained, shackled and hardly able to move in insanitary, inhumane conditions in the holds of boats, dying in their thousands on long voyages across the Atlantic and with women raped at will by the crew. Tony Reinke describes Newton over this period as …</p>
<blockquote><div>a wicked and insubordinate young man with a profane tongue, flesh-driven appetites, and stone cold heart. He had gambled his way into debt and dabbled in witchcraft. And as a young man in foreign lands, he had become sexually promiscuous. Later, as a young captain of a slave-trading ship, he may have indulged his lusts further by raping captive African women in the sexual free-for-alls on board ship that most captains in the trade regarded as theirs by right.</div></blockquote>
<p>But in 1748 Newton was in a violent storm at sea on a journey home from Africa via Brazil and Newfoundland with the boat about to sink or break up. Newton "by chance" (or as he would later say, by God's "amazing grace") had just come across an edition of Thomas à Kempis' <em>Imitation of Christ</em> where he had been reading about the brevity of life:</p>
<blockquote><div>since life is of short and uncertain continuance, it highly concerns you to look about you, and take good heed how you employ it. Today the man is vigorous, and gay, and flourishing, and tomorrow he is cut down, withered and gone.</div></blockquote>
<p>He then remembered verses learnt as a child in Proverbs 1:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Because I have called and you refused to listen, … I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock you when terror strikes</em> (vv. 24,26).</div></blockquote>
<p>So Newton thought he had no chance with God on Judgment Day. But after the storm abated he started to read the New Testament that was on the boat, and something spiritually "started" in his life. He took seriously Jesus' promises in verses like Luke 11.13 and John 7.17:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him; and if anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So that storm of March 1748 was a turning point for Newton, although he later wrote: "I cannot consider myself to have been a believer, in the full sense of the word, till a considerable time afterwards."</p>
<p><strong>Ordination</strong></p>
<p>In 1755 Newton ended his sea-going career and settled in Liverpool checking imported goods and detecting smugglers. It was there he met George Whitefield and got to know other leaders of the revival such as William Grimshaw of Haworth and Henry Venn of Huddersfield (grandfather of the Henry Venn of the Church Missionary Society and that supported the foundation of Jesmond Parish Church). He also began a period of "self education" and theological reading. Already with some knowledge of Latin and Greek he began to learn Hebrew.</p>
<p>Growing more mature as a believer, he considered full-time Christian ministry. The state of the Church of England meant it was difficult for him to get ordained. When he was just about to accept a post in a non-Anglican church, he was offered one in 1764 in the Buckinghamshire parish of Olney – a name made famous by the Olney Hymns, a collection of hymns he and William Cowper wrote for their mid-week meetings. The "human" reason for getting this appointment and getting ordained were the efforts of Lord Dartmouth on behalf of Newton. Lord Dartmouth was one of the few evangelical members of the House of Lords, a patron of Olney and, incidentally, Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time of the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Newton, not unnaturally, kept up a correspondence with Lord Dartmouth. And, nor unnaturally, Newton wrote New Year letters. So for this January's Coloured Supplement what follows is one such letter to Lord Dartmouth (slightly edited) and which is still of relevance in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>New Year's letter to Lord Dartmouth</strong></p>
<blockquote><div>My Lord,We have entered upon another year. So have thousands, perhaps millions, who will not see it close - an alarming thought to the wordling, at least it should be so! I have an imperfect remembrance of an account I read, when I was a boy, of an ice palace, built one winter at Petersburgh. The walls, the roof, the floors, the furniture, were all of ice, but finished with taste; and everything that might be expected in a royal palace was to be found there.The ice, while in the state of water, being previously coloured meant that to the eye all seemed formed of proper materials. But all was cold, useless and transient. Had the frost continued till now, the palace might have been standing. But with the returning spring it melted away, like the baseless fabric of a vision.Methinks there should have been one stone in the building to have retained the inscription, "Sic transit gloria mundi <em>[So the world's glory vanishes]</em>!" For no contrivance could exhibit a fitter illustration of the vanity of human life. Men build and plan as if their work were to endure forever. But the wind passes over them, and they are gone. In the midst of all their preparations, or at furthest when they think they have just completed their designs, their breath goeth forth, they return to their earth. In that very day their thoughts perish. "How many sleep who kept the world awake!" Yet this ice house had something of a leisurely dissolution, though. When it began to decay, all the art of man was unable to prop it <em>[up]</em>. But often death comes hastily, and, like the springing of a mine, destroys to the very foundations without previous notice. Then all we have been concerned in here (all but the consequences of our conduct, which will abide to eternity) will be no more to us than the remembrance of a dream.This truth is too plain to be denied. But the greater part of mankind act as if they were convinced it was false. They spend their days in vanity, and in a moment they go down to the grave. What cause of thankfulness have they, who are delivered from this delusion and who by the knowledge of the glorious gospel have learned their true state and end, are saved from the love of the present world, from the heart-distressing fear of death, and know, that if their earthly house were dissolved like the ice palace, they have a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!Yet even these are much concerned to realize the brevity and uncertainty of their present state, that they may be stimulated to make the most and the best of it, to redeem their time and manage their precarious opportunities so as may most tend to the praise and glory of him who has called them out of darkness into marvellous light. Why should any that have tasted that the Lord is gracious wish to live another day, but that they may have the honour to be fellow-workers with him, instrumental in promoting his designs, and of laying themselves out to the utmost of their abilities and influence in his service!… Though our first wish immediately upon our own accounts might be, to depart and be with Jesus, which is far better <em>[Phil 1.23]</em>, yet a lively thought of our immense obligations to his redeeming love, may reconcile us to a much longer continuance here, if we may by any means be subservient to diffuse the glory of his name, and the blessings of his salvation, which is God's great and principal end in preserving the world itself.When <em>[many]</em> historians and politicians descant upon the rise and fall of empires, with all their professed sagacity, in tracing the connexion between cause and effects, they are totally unacquainted with the great master-wheel which manages the whole movement - that is, the Lord's design in favour of his Church and Kingdom. To this, every event is subordinate; to this, every interfering interest must stoop. How easily might this position be proved, by reviewing the history of the period about the Reformation!… And I doubt not but some who are yet unborn will hereafter clearly see and remark that the present unhappy disputes between Great Britain and America, with their consequences, whatever they may be, are part of a series of events of which the extension and interests of the Church of Christ were the principal final causes. In a word, that Jesus may be known, trusted, and adored, and sinners by the power of his gospel be rescued from sin and Satan, is comparatively the one great business, for the sake of which the succession of day and night, summer and winter, is still maintained. And when the plan of redemption is consummated, sin, which now almost fills the earth, will then set it on fire; and the united interest of all the rest of mankind, when detached from that of the people of God, will not plead for its preservation a single day.In this view, I congratulate your Lordship, that however your best endeavours to serve the temporal interests of the nation may fall short of your wishes, yet, so far as your situation gives you opportunity of supporting the gospel cause and facilitating its progress, you have a prospect both of a more certain and more important success.For instance, it was, under God, your Lordship's favour and influence that brought me into the ministry. And though I be nothing, yet he who put it into your heart to patronize me, has been pleased not to suffer what you then did for his sake to be wholly in vain. He has been pleased, in a course of years, by so unworthy an instrument as I am, to awaken a number of persons, who were at that time dead in trespasses and sins, but now some of them are pressing on to the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus; and some of them are already before the throne.… Should I suggest in some companies, that the conversion of a hundred sinners (more or less) to God is an event of more real importance than the temporal prosperity of the greatest nation upon earth, I should be charged with ignorance and arrogance. But your Lordship is skilled in Scriptural arithmetic, which alone can teach us to estimate the value of souls, and will agree with me, that one soul is worth more than the whole world, on account of its redemption price, its vast capacities, and its duration… What an unexpected round have my thoughts taken since I set out from the ice palace! It is time to relieve our Lordship, and to subscribe myself,John Newton</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="The Litmus Test for a Free Society">(February 2016) The Litmus Test for a Free Society</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2016</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The UK Government with its Counter-Extremism Strategy wants to register "unregulated education settings". David Cameron, in his Party Conference speech, had said a new approach would apply to an institution "whatever its religion". Then he added, "if you are teaching intolerance, we will shut you down." There followed the recent Government's consultation on proposals for Ofsted [i.e. its school inspectors] to be able to inspect non-school youth groups in respect of British Values. But, as proposed, such inspections would catch many good church youth groups and, without properly defining British Values and without distinguishing tolerance for people themselves from tolerance for their beliefs (and practices), many churches are worried. They are worried that a growing secular extremism in the government means that some mainstream historic Christian teaching will itself be classified as extreme and so some church groups be "shut down". Of course, the promotion of Islamic terrorism among the young in some madrasas must be stopped. So too must obvious sexual and physical abuse of children in any church (or madrasa). Safeguarding procedures are in place to stop the latter. Procedures must be found to stop the former. However, they must not be what the government is currently proposing. The following is my January submission to the Department for Education.</p>
<p><strong>The submission</strong></p>
<p>To: the Department for Education 11 January 2016</p>
<p>Dear Secretary of State,</p>
<p>I wish to register strong opposition to the Government's Proposals for inspecting "out of school education settings" when the Government has not specified violence or child abuse as the "extremism" that needs opposing.</p>
<p>As the proposals stand many church youth groups and holiday clubs together with their Scout and Guide groups could be affected. If this is intended, such censorship is a serious infringement of religious freedom. It is also evidence of "secular extremism" in the Department for Education, which, being serious, itself needs opposition.</p>
<p>The Western Free World's tradition, with toleration being an essential part of that tradition, can only be properly understood in the context of religious freedom and the non-enforcement of religion or belief. John Locke was greatly responsible for the British tradition of toleration with his Letter of Toleration in the late 17th century. For him this meant freedom for all parties in the Wars of Religion. But that freedom meant that religions and beliefs could only be promoted through argument and not through force. So toleration then was primarily a requirement laid on the government in power not to use force to promote beliefs – whether Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Independent or Anabaptist.</p>
<p>But not all should be tolerated. Beliefs and ideas were to be free. What Locke said should not be tolerated was violence or sexual licence (he was worried at one extreme by Roman Catholics being disloyal to the crown and only recognizing a foreign jurisdiction and at the other extreme by antinomian anabaptist Protestant cults). Interestingly, Locke also said Muslims should be tolerated but not atheists! He famously said, "promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist."</p>
<p>From this history of toleration and from today's wider world, it is being argued that freedom of religion and belief is the most fundamental of freedoms in a nation. Therefore, the state of religious liberty, including the liberty to win converts from other faiths and none, is the litmus test for a truly free society. This was understood at the beginning of the modern era, with the desire for the separation of church and state. However, in the Western world that separation was not so that the state could be free from religion but free for religion. The USA has sought to ensure this freedom and separation through their Constitution (with the free-church non-conformists no longer being enforced to conform by Anglicans following the English 1662 Act of Uniformity). But this American experiment has not been entirely successful (witness their 'culture wars').</p>
<p>In Britain a constitutional and democratic monarchical system has helped preserve freedom of religion and is significantly different to that in the USA. The British system is light of touch and heavy on tradition. Peers, MPs, judges and Church of England clergy have to swear allegiance to the crown. However, the crown, in the person of our Queen, has to promise to govern "according to the laws and customs" of the UK (thus ensuring, in practice, legislative and judicial freedom for the state). She then also has to promise "to maintain the laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel" and has to "preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England" (thus ensuring, in practice, doctrinal freedom for the Church of England, and, with the Church of England being proxy for other denominations and faiths, freedom for other beliefs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, this establishment of the Christian religion and religious freedom has provided, at a public level, grounding for British Values of which the Lockean tradition of toleration is part. Indeed, those British Values depend on fundamental Christian assumptions which most men and women of good will and common sense want to maintain even when not believers themselves. All this is why the proposal for a government body censoring Christian churches in the form of their youth work is so serious. If followed through, it would be another example of the secular-extremism that undoubtedly is provoking the Islamic-extremism that the Department rightly opposes.</p>
<p>At an obvious level, to suggest that churches in the UK are radicalizing young people in a way that merits expensive (to the tax-payer) governmental action, is both laughable and shocking. Even Richard Dawkins, no friend to theism and no friend normally to the Christian faith, has said:</p>
<blockquote><div>there are no Christians, as far as I know, blowing up buildings. I am not aware of any Christian suicide bombers. I am not aware of any major Christian denomination that believes the penalty for apostasy is death. I have mixed feelings about the decline of Christianity, in so far as Christianity might be a bulwark against something worse"(The Times 2 April 2010).</div></blockquote>
<p>The extra time pressure on church volunteers, if the proposals were given effect, would mean many church youth groups would close, certainly in smaller churches. This would often be in poorer areas where there is no local financial church support for youth staff. Has the Department thought about who, or what, will take the place of such closures and who will pay? Of course there must not be youth meetings where the young are trained to blow up the Houses of Parliament or be suicide bombers on underground trains. But this currently is only a particular problem for our Islamic friends and has to be dealt with as such - not through a blanket proposal that defies the fundamental British Value of freedom of, and for, religion and belief.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>David Holloway,<br>Vicar of Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Jesmond Conference 2016 Statement: Teaching for Commitment">(March 2016) The Jesmond Conference 2016 Statement: Teaching for Commitment</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2016</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>On the 22nd and 23rd February 2016 Anglican clergy together with Christian teachers, governors, legal advisers, educational consultants, health advisers and church youth and student workers, met together in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne for 24 hours for the second of the modern Jesmond Conferences. Entitled <em><a href="http://printandaudio.org.uk/app/explore/resources/type/the-jesmond-conference/topic/jesmond-conference-16-teaching-for-commitment">Teaching for Commitment</a></em> this was convened by the vicar of Jesmond, David Holloway, to respond to recent challenges from the Department for Education to the Christian Church and its historic educational provision and traditions.</p>
<p>An immediate presenting problem had been the Government's school inspection system. This was on two counts. On the one hand, there was a concern in the North East over Ofsted inspectors inappropriately questioning young children over sexual matters with, reportedly, homosexual sex too frequently on their agenda and with the child being questioned on its own without another adult present.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were deep concerns nationally over the Government's proposals for inspecting "out of school education settings". This involves very serious matters of principle. If enforced, such inspection of Church youth activities would have transgressed the necessary boundary between Church and State and would be defying the fundamental British value and right of freedom of, and for, religion.</p>
<p>These two issues underlined the importance of taking counsel about fundamental issues regarding education. The intentions of the conference were, one, so that there might be a road map to a new educational concordat, which restores parental rights with regard to the education of their children, for the good both of children and the country, and, two, so that other necessary action might be taken in the light of the conference.</p>
<p>In preparation for the conference, members read background papers, entitled <em>The litmus test for a free society</em>;<em> How should Christians educate their children</em>; and <em>Paris, Jihadism and the battle for hearts and minds</em>. The conference dealt first with Fundamental Issues especially the fact of …</p>
<blockquote><div>… the parents … prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children<em>(UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights)</em></div></blockquote>
<p>… and the need for the school to support parents in the religious and moral education of their children that is given primarily in the family and home. To that end, action was seen to be needed as so many schools were ignoring the requirements of the 1988 Education Act, its religious clauses themselves being an endorsement of the British Christian educational tradition.</p>
<p>Also seen as important was the need for a clear Christian framework in the school. Many parents, and not just committed believers, are wanting their children to inherit such a framework or culture. For only when they are initiated into a definite primary faith culture have their children something from which rationally to compare, contrast and critique cultures in this confusing pluralistic world that is modern Britain. They then can make their own personal commitments. Census data plus experience suggest that most parents, even many of the "no religionists", would prefer that culture to be Christian rather than any other on offer, and certainly than a secular culture.</p>
<p>Then the conference considered <em>Christian faith and Scientism</em> and the historical course by which some of the conflicts over the Christian tradition and science had occurred, including those conflicts relating to human origins. It was suggested that issues relating to certain scientific assumptions, procedures and language, if not properly addressed, can undoubtedly result in an atheistic indoctrination of many children in our schools.</p>
<p>By contrast, and in reaction to any atheistic secularism, a reaction at the tertiary level was noted. Significant academics are asking fundamental questions about the purpose of education. Why, for example, have <em>our colleges and universities given up on the meaning of life</em> (to quote a recent book title). Allied to that concern is the fact that universities are enabling students to learn more and more about less and less. This has worrying long term implications if there are no unifying principles such as are supplied by the Christian faith. So these questions were asked: "Does this suggest we need not just more Christian schools but also Christian universities? But what would a Christian university look like in the UK?"</p>
<p>All that naturally led on to the subject of <em>Teaching Christian Sexual Ethics</em> and levels of serious sexual degeneracy experienced at college and university levels. It is hard to see this as a rational response. Others are now saying it has been socially constructed through, among other things, syllabuses, permissive legislation and the media. Also, it was said, a key factor or even the motor driving the sexual revolution, has been and is, the normalization of same-sex relationships; and the history of how this has been achieved reveals that a tiny minority (1.1 percent) of the population has caused a tectonic shift in Western sexual culture.</p>
<p>With the message heard that every sexual urge has a right to be fulfilled, the sexual flood gates have been opened, in schools as well as universities. In schools that was the result of the repeal in 2003 of the restraining 1988 Clause 28 that prohibited "the teaching … of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship". However, as an important counter to the new and sad Western homosexual culture, the conference was reminded of some words of John Stott, a great pastor and theologian, who helpfully said:</p>
<blockquote><div>We are all human beings. That is to say, there is no such phenomenon as 'a homosexual'. There are only people, human persons, made in the image and likeness of God, yet fallen, with all the glory and the tragedy which that paradox implies, including sexual potential and sexual problems.</div></blockquote>
<p>So, with such confusion, intellectual and sexual, what is the way forward in what some call a "multi-faith world"? The final discussion at the conference, entitled <em>Multi-faithism and the future</em>, sought to give some answers. It was seen that globally the modern world is not so much secularized, as pluralized. For except in the West most of the world is becoming more religious not less. But pluralization erodes traditional communities and de-institutionalizes them, leaving individuals isolated and with little social support. When marriage and the family are deinstitutionalized, socially damaging breakdown will occur and increase. That is why the redefinition of marriage to include same-sex couples was, and is, so dangerous and damaging. It has contributed to the further deinstitutionalizing and erosion of our sexual culture generally and marriage and the family particularly.</p>
<p>However, the negative consequences of such pluralism is leading world-wide to an advocacy of the "Old Paths" and faiths as they used to be and various forms of fundamentalisms. Not all of these are extremist, that is unless "old" is prejudicially a synonym for extreme. But some sadly are. These are not in the Christian tradition, however. In our pre-conference reading we were reminded of some words of the atheist, Richard Dawkins:</p>
<blockquote><div>There are no Christians, as far as I know, blowing up buildings. I am not aware of any Christian suicide bombers. I am not aware of any major Christian denomination that believes the penalty for apostasy is death. I have mixed feelings about the decline of Christianity, in so far as Christianity might be a bulwark against something worse.</div></blockquote>
<p>The conference was encouraged and challenged through two Bible expositions on Psalm 46 and Nehemiah 1 (and what follows). Conference members were encouraged to remember that they were not invulnerable, not indispensable, but also not insignificant; and so they needed to seize opportunities in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Jesmond Conference 2016 Resolutions</strong></p>
<p>In the light of all the deliberations and discussions, the conference agreed the following that:</p>
<ol>
<li>in line with the United Nations declaration of Human Rights, the right of parental choice in education must be recovered in the UK.</li>
<li>a clear primary faith culture in schools needs to be recovered, which, following census data, in the great majority of schools should be Christian.</li>
<li>cases of clear discrimination against Christians in schools, Christian schools and proposed Christian schools must be addressed.</li>
<li>the vicar of Jesmond should set up a working group that will consider the Jesmond Conference 2016 papers, addresses, group submissions and resolutions, take appropriate action and produce a report for the end of February 2017.</li>
</ol>                    <hr><h2 id="The Dark Reality of Hell">(April 2016) The Dark Reality of Hell</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2016</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>A Strange World</strong></p>
<p>The good news of Easter is that a real resurrection of Jesus from the dead, with a real tomb empty with a real glorified and recognisable body, means that the real reality of hell has been defeated. As Christians have sung, over the centuries, in the ancient Christian hymn, the Te Deum:</p>
<blockquote><div>when you had overcome the sharpness of death, you opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</div></blockquote>
<p>And Good Friday is "good" because sin is real and leads, unless dealt with, to hell as an inevitable consequence. For God does not smile on the wickedness and evil of human sin, whether of suicide bombers killing innocent bystanders or of other sin. But on the cross Jesus Christ died in our place to free us from the judgment of being cast away from God's presence forever that we deserve.&nbsp;However, a headline in The Times, the Saturday before Easter Day 2016, said this: "Although heaven and hell are out of fashion, more and more people of all faiths or none believe in an afterlife," and then this comment followed:</p>
<blockquote><div>No one talks of hell these days. Its theological importance as the stick to the heavenly carrot, so gorily powerful in medieval art, is over. The Church of England has long steered clear of hellfire sermons. Even the US evangelical movement, famed for its brimstone preachers, has cleverly adopted a policy of 'Love Wins'.</div></blockquote>
<p>How different all that is from the time of Hudson Taylor (1832-1905) from whom we have much to learn. Let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>Hudson Taylor and Mission</strong></p>
<p>Hudson Taylor, the great missionary to China, once said: "I would never have thought of going out to China had I not believed that the Chinese were lost and needed Christ." That was because Hudson Taylor knew his Bible. For example, he knew that the Apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 5.11: <em>"knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others."</em></p>
<p>In line with the great Christian tradition, the fact of future judgment was still a motive for Hudson Taylor's evangelism. For apostolic biblical Christianity has recognised at least three main motives for mission and evangelism: first, the glory of God; secondly, obedience to the Great Commission of Jesus to go into all the world to preach the gospel; but then, thirdly, this concern for the "lost". And it is this last motive that has been underplayed in recent times and that we, surely, need to recover.</p>
<p>As that newspaper article indicated, many Christians are now too cautious about "hell". Undoubtedly over the centuries there will have been some extravagant and unhelpful things said about God's judgment that go beyond what the Bible teaches. Also some have been cautious because of wanting to be "relevant" to the "modern world". This makes them irrationally think that the more you accommodate to present assumptions and beliefs, the more people will be interested in what you have to say! But, of course, that is not the case. What is relevant (and interesting to the modern world) is what, rationally, critiques modern assumptions and beliefs and as you, then, say something that is true.</p>
<p>However, one problem people have with the doctrine of hell and the reason for wanting to revise it according to Rob Bell, a revisionist and author of the book Love Wins, is that …</p>
<blockquote><div>… millions of Christians secretly struggle with how to reconcile God's love and God's judgment: has God created billions of people over thousands of years only to select a few to go to heaven and everyone else to suffer forever in hell? Is this acceptable to God? How is this 'good news'?</div></blockquote>
<p>But Rob Bell has got it wrong. Classical Christian teaching does not teach only a tiny few are in heaven while billions are in hell.</p>
<p><strong>Many "saved"</strong></p>
<p>The problem has been that some people fail to consider Jesus' teaching as a whole; and especially do they fail to realise that Jesus never answered the question, in Luke 13.23, when <em>"someone said to him </em>[Jesus]<em>, 'Lord, will those who are saved be few?'"</em> with a positive "yes!" Instead he responded obliquely with a command: <em>"Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."</em> But then he goes on, after referring to the possibility of hell, to say that <em>"people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God"</em> (Luke 13.29).</p>
<p>So, as John says in Revelation, in heaven there will be those <em>"from every tribe and language and people and nation"</em> along with <em>"many angels, numbering myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands"</em> (Rev 5.9,11). We must expect those numbers of internationals equally to be huge. However, it is true that some estimates of the proportions of those "saved" have been attempted and with tiny results. In the 18th century, a Scottish elder in the Parish of Mauchline, Ayrshire, estimated one "elect" to ten "non-elect"!</p>
<p>But that is to misunderstand Jesus in Luke 13 (above). For Jesus may well have been speaking of the situation in Palestine during his ministry when he said many were not able to <em>"enter"</em> through <em>"the narrow door"</em>. For there was a great and rapid increase in the number of his followers after his death and resurrection. Within a few months from his crucifixion, the number of his followers in Palestine was ten times as great as it had been during his ministry. And certainly Paul speaks in Romans unambiguously about those who identify with Christ by faith as <em>"the many"</em> (Rom 5.15,19). As Professor F.F.Bruce writes of Romans 5:</p>
<blockquote><div>no valid exegesis can make 'the many' mean a minority, for (as Calvin <em>[the great 16th century Reformer]</em> reasonably puts it in his exposition of this passage) 'if Adam's fall had the effect of producing the ruin of many, the grace of God is much more efficacious in benefiting many, since admittedly Christ is much more powerful to save than Adam was to ruin.' C.H.Spurgeon, the greatest English Calvinist of the 19th century, is said to have prayed more than once, 'Lord hasten to bring in all thine elect, and then elect some more.' I cannot discover any theological objection to such a prayer, bearing in mind the sovereignty of God's grace. If one thing is more certain than another about the God of the Bible, it is this, that in his zeal to save, he will inaugurate means to bless his creatures beyond our wit to conceive or anticipate.</div></blockquote>
<p>However, none of that positive thinking allows us to ignore the fact that Jesus spoke much about hell to his generation; and that was when there was a huge rejection of his ministry, and, indeed, the ultimate rejection of him through crucifixion. Currently in the West, at any rate, there is a similar great rejection. How, therefore, our world must face the reality that beyond death is hell as well as heaven!</p>
<p><strong>Dr J.I.Packer</strong></p>
<p>So people today could, with profit, read the following paragraphs that are an (edited) version of a lecture given by Dr J.I.Packer and appeared formerly as a Coloured Supplement in 1992:</p>
<blockquote><div>The thought that people one knows and cares for, not to mention oneself, might face a destiny that could be described as eternal punishment, will be profoundly disturbing. We scoff at hell fire as a bad dream. We write off the idea as a hangover from primitive ages long past; and when we meet someone who still believes in eternal punishment we regard them as at least quaint, and perhaps weird; we certainly do not take them seriously.<strong>Jesus' Teaching</strong>My first task now must be to point out as forcefully as I can that Jesus and the Apostles do not let us off the hook with regard to eternal punishment, as we so blithely let ourselves off it. As W.G.T.Shedd affirmed a century ago:"The strongest support of the doctrine of Endless Punishment is the teaching of Christ, the Redeemer of men … Christ could not have warned men so frequently and earnestly as he did against 'the fire that shall never be quenched,' and 'the worm that dies not,' had he known that there is no future peril to correspond to them … Jesus Christ is the Person who is responsible for the doctrine of Eternal Perdition."In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats Jesus says:<em>Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels … And these will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life</em> (Matthew 25.41,46).Of this <em>fire</em> Jesus had spoken often, using the word Gehenna, (the Greek form of "the Valley of Hinnom"). This was an area outside the wall of Jerusalem where children had once been offered as burnt sacrifices to Molech (cf 2 Chronicles 28.3; 33.6) and which had become the city's incinerator area, where the city's garbage and the corpses of the family-less were daily burned. He refers to <em>the hell </em>[Greek, gehenna]<em> of fire</em> (Matt 5.22; 18.9). Mark's Gospel speaks of a person going into <em>hell </em>[gehenna]<em>, to the unquenchable fire</em> and of a person <em>thrown into hell </em>[gehenna]<em>, where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched</em> (Mark 9.43,48).And with all this should be linked Jesus' picture of tares and bad fish being thrown into<em> "the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth</em> (Matt 13.42,50); and also the grim form of Jesus' call for courage as he sends out the twelve:<em>Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell".&nbsp;</em>(Matt 10.28)The one to be feared is not the devil but the one whom Jesus called Father! We may summarize as follows: Jesus speaks of a destiny of being in the fire for all people everywhere whom he does not accept as his own. He calls the fire "Gehenna" and describes it as<em> "eternal</em>, part of the abiding future order of things, and as never going out. To enter or be thrown into it brings unqualified distress (<em>weeping and gnashing of teeth</em>) – a condition that Jesus elsewhere ascribes, we should note, to those banished at judgment day to <em>the outer darkness</em> (Matt 8.12; 22.13; 25.30). Clearly, we are in the world of imagery – fire and darkness are both picturing the same condition; and, what is being pictured is a condition that is unimaginably dreadful, one that it is worth any labour and any cost to avoid. And the speaker is the incarnate Son of God, our divine instructor!<strong>The Apostles' Teaching</strong>The Apostolic writers follow in their Master's footsteps. Paul declares:<em>When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in blazing fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord</em> (2 Thess 1.7-9).Jude verse 7 reads,<em>Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.</em>Jude verse 13 speaks of certain immoral folk in the church as <em>wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.</em> Revelation 14.10-11 warns that anyone who worships the beast <em>will be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever.</em> Rev 20.10 pictures a lake of burning sulphur into which at the last judgment the devil, the beast, and the false prophet are thrown, to be <em>tormented day and night for ever and ever</em>. Then, in verse 14, Death and Hades are thrown into it; and that is identified with<em> "the second death</em> which, verse 6 has told us, would have no power over God's saints; and verse 15 declares: <em>If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</em><strong>Jesus' and Paul's Deep Sadness</strong>But in using these ideas Jesus imparted to them a nuance, or temper of what we can only call "traumatic awe"; a passionate gladness that justice will be done for God's glory, linked with an equally passionate sadness that fellow human beings, no matter how perverse, will thereby be ruined. This traumatic awe is seen in Jesus' tearful words over Jerusalem (Luke 19.41-44) and in his compassionate admonition, <em>Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; but weep for yourselves and for your children …</em> (Luke 23.28-31). Similar sadness comes out in Paul's heart-cry about the Jews whose rejection by God he announces:<em>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers... ; my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved</em> (Rom 9.2-3; 10.1).The same traumatic awe, or awe-filled trauma, will strike the soul of every thoughtful Christian with unconverted relatives and friends, who takes seriously the promise that Jesus, the Saviour, will one day return to judge the living and the dead. And surely we may boldly say that, though it is not in the least comfortable, yet it is healthy for us to feel that trauma and to be unable, like Paul before us, to find relief from pain save in wholehearted commitment to the ministry of spreading the gospel, in which we <em>become all things to all people, that by all means we may save some</em> (1 Cor 9.22), and so fulfil Jude's blunt summons: <em>save others by snatching them out of the fire</em> (Jude 23).The only spiritual method of alleviating distress at the prospect of souls being lost is to take action to win them; and the theological way of stating that is this; it is to say that God enables us to live with the prospect of people we know (or know of) possibly being lost by moving us to pray and work, so that they may not be lost, and, indeed, by using that prospect in our consciences to stir us up to this mode of action. But the eternal punishment of all the ungodly, nonetheless, remains a distressing truth to discuss; which makes it vital to have at our command, for the purpose, a form of words that is conceptually clear but not emotionally loaded.<strong>Careful Discussion</strong>Though the language of <em>punishment</em>, in the sense of God's judicial infliction, is abundantly scriptural as we have seen, I am now going to drop it. For it conjures up unhelpful suspicions. Modern thought is sceptical as to whether punishment that does not serve the purpose of reforming the offender and safeguarding others can ever be justified; and talk about God's punitive role on the last day, when neither of these further goals can enter into the reckoning, is bound to feed the suspicion that God is in truth arbitrary and vindictive in a way that is not quite admirable, because it is not quite moral. Indeed, the widespread revolt against the idea of eternal punishment during the past century has sprung from this suspicion. By the same token, I do not propose to use the word <em>torment</em>, scriptural though it is. To the modern mind it suggest sadism and cruelty and torture, and what we are talking about is none of these things, but the adorable justice of a holy Creator who deals righteously with people according to their works.I propose to speak of the divinely executed retributive process that operates in the world to come. First, the phraseology is not emotionally loaded, and it should not cloud discussion. Secondly, individual retribution as one aspect of the larger reality of divine judgment, whereby evil is stopped in its tracks and righteousness restored, is precisely what we are talking about. Punishment can be arbitrary and not proportionate to the wrongdoing. But retribution means that one's past becomes the decisive factor in determining one's present; for one gets what one deserves. And, thirdly, the language of retribution permits the blending in our minds of two thoughts that are blended in the Bible – namely, that the condemnation justly imposed by God as the Judge, vindicating righteousness, is also, and in a sense primarily, self-inflicted through our own perversity in choosing death rather than life (John 3.18-20).We choose to retreat from God rather than repent before God; and God's judicial sentence is a ratifying for eternity of the sentence of separation from God that we, by our own choice, have already passed on ourselves. Teachers like C.S.Lewis stress the thought that no one is in hell who has not chosen to be there, in the sense of choosing to be self-absorbed and to keep God out of his or her life; and that is evidently one aspect of the grim truth.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>But the good news is still that <em>"God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life"</em> (John 3.16).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Europe, Nations and the Referendum">(May 2016) Europe, Nations and the Referendum</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2016</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p>What are we to think about the European Union? People are confused. Not least are they confused about the purpose of the EU as it has evolved after World War II. Much of the confusion is because there has been no real agreement as to what it is for. The British Government seems to thinks its main purpose is, one, for "protecting jobs", two, for ensuring a "stronger economy" and, three, for "providing security" in this terrorist age (see the back page of the pamphlet delivered through our doors, Why the Government believes that voting to remain in the European Union is the best decision for the UK).</p>
<p>But, historically, as one Christian supporter of the European project once said:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>the first objective of the Community is to create peace in place of Europe's terrible tribal wars, the last two of which cost 50 million dead</em>- Sir Fred Catherwood</div></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly, that was the overriding concern of the early founders of post-war Europe and its institutions. Jean Monnet, the great architect of modern Europe, had this as his goal. But, secondly, Monnet quite openly wanted to recover the glories of the old Holy Roman Empire. That dream, of course, has a long and chequered history going back to the Romans themselves; then in 800 AD Charlemagne when regained the title "emperor"; and, later, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hitler all had ideas of creating a united Europe, but by force and unsuccessfully. Then, thirdly, there was the objective of economic benefit, with economic security being believed to be the true foundation for political stability.</p>
<p>However, a real problem, in terms of Europe having an agreed agenda, was this: Jean Monnet, master politician that he was, never really declared his hand about wanting a new United States of Europe. However, he believed that the Continent and its long-term unity did not need a single grand act of union. Rather it would grow into a united state by a slow and steady process. So he wrote in 1952 to Robert Schuman, the founder of the European Coal and Steel Community:</p>
<blockquote><div>Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidity.</div></blockquote>
<p>But such an agenda for a United States of Europe, or a European super state, was never agreed. There has never been a teasing out of whether the EU is working towards a truly federal system, or just an empire with a decentralized system. What is the difference? A truly federal system (unlike that in the United States of America) is where ultimate legal and coercive sovereignty remains with independent nations, but has unity through "agreements" (foedus is Latin for agreement) such as that agreement over "coal and steel". In the decentralized system ultimate legal and coercive sovereignty is exercised from the top as in the Roman Empire (with Paul's appeal to Caesar), but it delegates a range of, even many, tasks and decisions to the periphery (the various nations over which it has control). The European project is not yet like ancient Rome. Indeed, it is all so complicated.</p>
<p>Even if Britain leaves the EU, it will still be subject to the European Court of Human Rights which is not subject to the European Parliament but to the Council of Europe! Another serious problem is that Britain has a Christian Constitution through "the Queen in Parliament", whereas the European Union's Constitution is intentionally secular following the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>The Bible On Nations And Super-States</strong></p>
<p>But does the Bible help our thinking on Europe, the nation state or a super state? First we must note the Bible does not start with nations or super states but with humanity. Humanity is primordial according to Genesis 1-2. Nations appear only in Genesis 10-11. Genesis 10 concludes with the words,</p>
<blockquote><div><em>these are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood</em> (Gen 10.32).</div></blockquote>
<p>So nations are not part of God's creational ordering but of his providential ordering to provide for human needs. And they develop quite differently, some become small states, some become super states or great empires, like Egypt in the time of Joseph, Babylon in the time of Jeremiah and Rome in the time of Jesus. But not all patterns of human gathering together as super states for human benefit are to be tolerated. Genesis 11 and the tower of Babel give us a warning. That was when people…</p>
<blockquote><div><em>…found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there... Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth' … And the Lord said, 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech.' So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city"&nbsp;</em>(Gen 11.2, 4, 6-8).</div></blockquote>
<p>God's providential will had been for human dispersal across the planet for human survival. In Genesis 1 the divine command for human survival, is <em>"be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth"</em> (Gen 1.28). That command was repeated after the Fall and the Flood in Genesis 9 to Noah and his sons, <em>"be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it"</em> (Gen 9.7). Babel was essentially disobedience by wanting a future separate from God and his purposes. For God's purposes for social life were to be achieved not through a Godless global unity when nothing <em>"they propose to do will now be impossible for them"</em>. Nor was it going to be achieved through scattered independent but Godless smaller groups (which are a lesser evil because with lesser power). But it would be achieved through separate nations in communion with God and peace with each other with all their diversity and differentiation.</p>
<p>That is what the next chapter in Genesis, Genesis 12, tells us through the call of Abraham, Sarah and the family that leads to the election of the nation of Israel. For Israel is to be a light to the nations now scattered throughout the earth. The call of Abraham is not just about the forming of the nation Israel for Israel's benefit, but for transforming people of other nations who in heaven, as Revelation 7.9 makes clear, would be<em> "a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb."</em> Human differentiation and diversity through a worshipful and obedient relationship with God, is clearly part of the divine purpose. And the nation of Israel is to bring that about. As Moses is told by God at Mount Sinai, <em>"among all peoples … you </em>[the people of Israel]<em> shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"</em> (Ex 19.6). Israel is to function among the nations as a priest functions within its own nation. So Israel is to witness to what God has done and said to and for all nations. But with the coming of Christ the new age has begun when one day <em>"people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God"</em> (Luke 13.29). But the fulfilment is not yet. Paul's speech at Athens makes this clear:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God… Now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead</em> (Acts 17.26-27,31).</div></blockquote>
<p>So the Church of Christ now has the vocation of the old Israel. Peter writes to Christians: <em>"You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light"</em> (1 Peter 2.9).</p>
<p><strong>The Need For God's "Marvelous Light"</strong></p>
<p>At the deepest level, therefore, Christians should be working for Europe to be "repurposed", to quote Pierre Manent, in a recent article in the journal First Things. He notes that the generation of the shapers of modern Europe, such as Churchill and De Gaulle, were fighting in World War II to prevent Hitler from destroying other European nations' freedoms, identity and Christian faith (be it Protestant, Catholic or Orthodox). But then came the 1960s, and particularly the student riots in France in 1968, after which generally across the West national traditions and rules, and those things that had been fought for, were delegitimized, deconstructed and destroyed, not least those intermediate communities such as the family, the church and, increasingly, the independent nation. Instead the individual was to rule with one supreme value being the individual's right to do exactly as he or she pleased, while the other supreme value was a God-rejecting, ill-defined "humanity".</p>
<p>With the current political class being children of the 1960s, not surprisingly its members have few of those inbred national values their parents and grandparents fought for, and that an immediate post-war Europe was to unite to protect. But now the nation states of Europe are morally, spiritually and politically weak, inevitably with such a religion of "the self" and often positively rejecting Christian values and beliefs. So European leaders equally often lack vision, being mere "celebrities" with varying degrees of intelligence, expertise and zeal. And Europe itself becomes, in Manent's phrase, "an abstract social space where the sole principle of legitimacy now resides in human rights, understood as the unlimited rights of individual particularity." That may be exaggerating, but too near the truth for comfort. So what politically is most likely to bring the necessary change back to a more Christian world view in Europe, currently the most secular region on our planet?</p>

                                                <p><em>A sermon preached in All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi&nbsp;on 1st May 2016, by David Holloway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why Spiritual Growth?</strong></p>
<p>Our subject is 'spiritual growth'. But, there may be someone here this morning who is asking, "Why should we be concerned with spiritual growth?" A simple answer is this: while undoubtedly there are vast changes in the modern world, three things never change. Let me explain.</p>
<p>The world has radically changed since I first stepped onto Kenyan soil in 1965. In those days the road from Nairobi to Mombasa, outside the city, was a murram road for much of the way. And there was very little traffic. Contrast that with last Friday evening's traffic jams!</p>
<p>In those days I was working for the CMS (the Church Missionary Society) in Omdurman in the Sudan. But then, in the 1960s there were no emails or news apps on a smart phone. You communicated by airmail letter on (so called) India paper. And the news, for us British people, came from The (London) Times newspaper, also printed on lightweight India paper, and reaching the Sudan two weeks late if you were fortunate. But with all the world's change (and often for the good) the basic problems of life are the same now as they were in the past then. They have not changed. They still require spiritual solutions and spiritual growth.</p>
<p><strong>The World's Three Great Problems</strong></p>
<p>It was the evangelist, Billy Graham, who used to identify three such problems that were, and are, often terrible and always tragic. They were there in Old and New Testament times. They were there back in the 1960s and they are still with us today.</p>
<p>The first problem is <em>sin</em>. And sin certainly has not changed. People have changed its name, and there are all sorts of attempts to alter behaviours to soften sin's effects. But men and women are still sinners putting themselves in the place of God. And the results of sin are still "disease, disappointment, despair, disillusionment and hell," to quote Graham.</p>
<p>Then the second problem is <em>sorrow</em> and that has not changed. The friends and loved ones of those who died in that terrible Nairobi building collapse on Friday know that only too well. So do the friends and loved ones of those others who died because of the rains. And, of course, there are family and personal sorrows that few, if any, know about. A number here this morning will be only too well aware of such personal sorrow.</p>
<p>And the third problem is <em>death</em> and that has not changed. As the atheist George Bernard Shaw once said, "one out of every one dies." And the sadness is that for millions there is no hope. Another atheist, the philosopher Bertrand Russell, wrote in his autobiography, "there is darkness without, and when I die there will be darkness within."</p>
<p><strong>Grow Spiritually To Bring Hope</strong></p>
<p>So those are three problems that mark every generation of history. The past is stained with sin. The present is full of sorrow. And the certainty of death faces each one in the future. And for millions, when they have time to reflect on these things, they are reduced to feelings of hopelessness. But that is precisely why the world needs to know that there is a solution to the problems of sin, sorrow and death. And that solution is one reason why Christian people must grow spiritually. For as Peter said in 1 Peter 3.15, you are to be …</p>
<blockquote><div><em>always… prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope </em>[he doesn't say 'faith' but 'hope']<em> that you have.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>You are to grow spiritually to be able to witness to that solution which can be expressed in ten words.</p>
<p>Some of you who travel in aeroplanes may, like me, always choose the information option on the plane's monitors. That shows you the route and other details of the flight. To make clear where you are going, you are given changing maps. And they go from large scale maps, to medium scale maps, to small scale maps showing you much, if not all, of the world.</p>
<p>You are given something like that regarding the Christian life, to make it clear where you are going spiritually. For to know your way around spiritually, you need information on the small scale that embraces so much, like you have in the Bible with its three quarters of a million words. You then need statements on an intermediate scale, such as the Anglican 39 Articles. Then on a larger scale you need the Nicene and Apostles Creeds.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus – The Same Yesterday, Today And Forever</strong></p>
<p>But also essential are some of those very large scale verses of Scripture. They sum up much fundamental truth, such as John 3.16. And one such large scale truth verse supplies the answer to those three problems. Its truth is found in only ten words in the letter to the Hebrews. The ten words are simply:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever</em>&nbsp;(Hebrews 13.8)</div></blockquote>
<p>That glorious truth means that while the world may and does change, Jesus, and all he means, does not change. And millions upon millions have proved the truth of that verse.</p>
<p>The word <em>"yesterday"</em> refers to Jesus' incarnation when he was on earth, teaching and, of course, dying. <em>"Today"</em> refers to 2016 when, risen, he is in heaven and reigning over all, as we celebrate this coming Thursday on Ascension Day. And <em>"forever"</em> looks to the future when he will come again. Then there will not only be judgment but the great hope of a new heaven and a new earth.</p>
<p>Yesterday he died to bear your sin, so you can be forgiven for all eternity. Then today as you experience those sad times, he is praying for you, from heaven, and you can take your sorrows to him for he cares for you. And one day he is coming again for you, if you truly trust in him. So other things may change but Christ will never change.</p>
<p>Who here this morning needs to learn that lesson? Who has never yet surrendered to Jesus Christ and begun the spiritual life so that you can start to grow spiritually? Well, let me quote those famous 26 words from John's Gospel and chapter 3, for you to think about and, if you can, respond to:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever </em>[so that includes you]<em> believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Disease Of False Teaching Impedes Spiritual Growth</strong></p>
<p>But Jesus, in John 3, has just spoken about eternal life beginning now in this life with a new birth. It is a metaphor for a real spiritual fact. It means that such a born-again person has new power, because of new spiritual life that the Holy Spirit brings.</p>
<p>However - and this is a big 'however' - in human life, as we all know, there are diseases and disabilities. These can prevent proper development and growth. But that is also so true of the Christian life. There are diseases and other negative factors that prevent healthy spiritual growth. And there were some of these referred to this morning in our Bible readings from Peter's and then Paul's letters. Let's think about them (2 Peter 3.14-18 and Ephesians 4.1-7).</p>
<p>First, what does Peter have to say to us about these diseases or infections? They relate to some of the background culture of 2 Peter. For in the background is the reality of heretical teaching that goes under the label "gnostic". We know of this from some of the early Christian fathers, together with modern archaeological finds. They reveal a weird hotchpotch of ideas that people can have and believe in, when they drift away from clear biblical, apostolic Christianity but want still to be connected with the Church. And such teaching is the background to 2 Peter and it was totally false.</p>
<p><strong>The Denial Of The Second Coming Of Christ</strong></p>
<p>So Peter's first spiritual health warning is to be on your guard against spiritual diseases from such false teachers. In earlier verses of chapter 3 you can read how people were denying the Second Coming of Christ. Happily, the recipients of Peter's letter would have none of that. They knew that history was linear, and that, as Genesis 1 clearly teaches, God created time. No matter how you interpret the "days" in Genesis 1, it is clear that they were all part of God's creation. And the Bible clearly teaches that time, as we know it, not only began: one day it will end – with Christ's return and a New Heaven and New Earth. All that may be hard to imagine. But never confuse the unimaginable with the unbelievable. When I first visited Kenya it was unimaginable that anyone could walk on the moon. But only four years later Neil Armstrong defied our imaginations and did just that - walk on the moon.</p>
<p>The proof of that linear understanding of time is Jesus' real resurrection leaving a tomb empty that first Easter. That is what Paul told the Greeks in Athens who probably had a cyclical view of time and history. In Acts 17.30 he ended his sermon at Athens with these words:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>God… now… commands all people to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So on the basis of their confidence in the second coming of Christ, Peter writes in 2 Peter 3.14:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>So then dear friends, since you are looking forward to this </em>[Christ's coming again]<em>, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.</em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Teaching That Endorses Sexual Immorality</strong></p>
<p>You see, the false teachers then, as now, did not only deny basic credal doctrines, such as the Second Coming of Jesus. They also denied, then, as now, basic New Testament morality, including sexual morality. For in 2 Peter <em>"spotless"</em> and<em> "blameless"</em> has to do with drunken orgies. After talking about Sodom and Gomorrah, he talks about these false teachers in 2 Peter 2.13:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes </em>[the same words as in 3.14 but without their negative prefixes]<em>, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed – an accursed brood.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So – one way you grow spiritually is as you heed this warning of spiritual infection. Peter says in verse 17 of our chapter:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Dear friends, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And do not think that such a situation could only happen in the 1st century. This situation of people denying fundamental doctrine and ethics is still happening. We at Jesmond Parish Church in England have had to be in impaired communion with our bishop over doubts and denials of the virginal conception of Jesus and his empty tomb; and also because of our bishop saying that homosexual relationships are permitted for the laity.</p>
<p><strong>Making The Bible Mean What You Want</strong></p>
<p>But how do such lawless people worm their way into the Church? One answer is there in verse 16 of 2 Peter 3 and the reference to Paul, where Peter says,</p>
<blockquote><div><em>His </em>[Paul's]<em> letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>In Britain we have just been noting the four-hundredth anniversary of the death of the great British playwright, William Shakespeare. I never forget his line in the Merchant of Venice where Antonio says:</p>
<blockquote><div>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</div></blockquote>
<p>That is a reference to the devil quoting Scripture and tempting Jesus in the wilderness as recorded in Matthew 4. If you pick and choose what you like from the Bible, you can justify all sorts of wicked things. But as Anglicans we should be clear. Article XX of the Thirty-nine says::</p>
<blockquote><div>It is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Bible is progressive revelation but it is also cumulative revelation. So the Old Testament has to be interpreted in the light of the New and the New Testament in the light of the Old. That's why you may not make</p>
<blockquote><div><em>one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>To summarise, then - Peter here is warning about two diseases that stunt Spiritual Growth. One, is the disease of failing to guard against false teaching, and a second is connected, namely the disease of failing to recognise how people are clearly distorting the Bible's plain message. How we should all learn from Peter and guard against those spiritual diseases, if we want to grow spiritually!</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Growth Requires Unity Through Humility And Love</strong></p>
<p>That, finally, brings us to Paul, and what he teaches about Spiritual Growth. In chapter 4 of Ephesians Paul is highlighting church disunity as a disease threatening spiritual growth. Yes, Paul is as tough as any against false teachers. Later in Ephesians chapter 4 in verse 14 he refers to false teaching that causes people to be:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>But Paul in these opening verses of chapter 3 is making a different point. Like Peter, Paul says you have to <em>"make every effort".</em> Peter says, <em>"make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him",&nbsp;</em>referring to that immoral false teaching. But Paul says in Ephesians 4.3: <em>"make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."</em></p>
<p>Unity is so important. But how do you work for unity? Paul says in 4.2:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>When the chips are down we can all be awkward customers. We all have rough edges. So how important that you bear <em>"with one another in love".</em> And Paul later says in this chapter, when you have to be tough with one another, you should speak <em>"the truth in love"</em>. On the one hand, it is often loving to speak hard truth. But, on the other hand, hard truth should be communicated lovingly. So, first, the cultivation of Christlike humility and love are necessary for the unity the Church.</p>
<p><strong>Unity Requires Unity Over Fundamental Doctrine</strong></p>
<p>But, secondly, for conquering the disease of disunity, you need unity from the confidence that there is only, as Paul writes, <em>"one body and one Spirit… one hope… one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</em> For there is no plurality of gods or goddesses and multi-faithism. As Peter said of Jesus before the Jewish leadership soon after Jesus' Resurrection and Ascension:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved</em>&nbsp;(Acts 4.12).</div></blockquote>
<p>So the disease of disunity is also countered by unity over fundamental Trinitarian doctrine including the uniqueness and finality of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I must conclude. In doing so, may I just say this? The lessons from today's readings, which from your series were not my choice but, I believe, providential, are surely relevant as a new Archbishop is appointed later this month. They teach that you should be praying for a man who is faithful in fighting off spiritual diseases, especially the disease of false teaching, and so he will enable spiritual growth. He also needs to strive to maintain the unity of the Church through humility and love but with a firmness over fundamental doctrine and ethics.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Madness of Crowds - Transexualism">(August 2016) The Madness of Crowds - Transexualism</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2016</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>'The Madness of Crowds'</strong></p>
<p>Twenty years before Jesmond Parish Church was founded, a best selling book was published in 1841 with the title, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. It was reprinted as recently as 2006. The following original preface by the author, Charles Mackay (1814-1889) contained these words:</p>
<blockquote><div>The object of the author in the following pages has been to collect the most remarkable instances of those moral epidemics which have been excited, sometimes by one cause and sometimes by another, and to show how easily the masses have been led astray, and how imitative and gregarious men are, even in their infatuations and crimes.</div></blockquote>
<p>The book came to mind when at the end of last month (18 July 2016) The Times newspaper had a headline: "Address your transgender pupils as 'zie', teachers are told." There was then the following report:</p>
<blockquote><div>Boarding school teachers should describe transgender pupils as 'zie' to avoid offence, according to guidance. It aims to help teachers deal sensitively with pupils who identify as another gender or as neither. Staff have been told to learn a new vocabulary for pupils who do not want to be addressed as 'he' or 'she'. The new words and phrases include 'genderqueer' (someone who identifies as neither male or female) and 'pansexual' (someone attracted to men, women and transgender people). Schools are also being told that they should display an equality pledge for all visitors to read and sign. Some have introduced gender-neutral uniforms, including Brighton College in the private sector and about 80 state schools.</div></blockquote>
<p>Peter Mullen, commenting on this in the Church of England Newspaper, wrote: "There is a technical word to describe these innovations and the word is 'barmy'. There is another word, less amusing but more accurate, and it is 'decadence'."</p>
<p><strong>Basic reality</strong></p>
<p>The Christian World View relating to what is male and female comes from the Bible and the first chapter of Genesis as endorsed by Jesus. This is in line with common sense, scientific fact and human language (as you would expect if the Bible does reveal truth). Genesis 1.27 says that in the beginning <em>"God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."</em></p>
<p>So human beings are fundamentally of two kinds (a word used is 'di-morphic') - either you are of the male sex or the female sex. Yes, the way of being male or being female is di-polar: that is to say there are two poles, a masculine one and a feminine one, between which people can behave as males and females, or, as we say, be masculine or feminine. That is why, properly, your sex is male or female, while your gender is masculine or feminine. The terms 'sex' and 'gender' are often used loosely, but the reality is this: you never can be more male or more female than the day you were conceived. Oliver O'Donovan expresses it well:</p>
<blockquote><div>It is sometimes suggested that the understanding of human sexuality as di-morphic is outdated by modern medical discoveries, and that it would be more true to think of sex as di-polar … Here we touch upon a question of central importance for the discussion of transsexualism, the relation between the psychological <em>[or sociological]</em> analysis of sexuality in terms of behaviour patterns and the biological analysis in terms of chromosomal, gonadal and genital structure. The case can certainly be made at the psychological<em> [or sociological]</em> level for a di-polar opposition rather than a di-morphic one. It can, that is, be argued that masculinity and femininity are matters of relatively more or less rather than either-or. But it is generally well known that the starting point for basic di-morphic differentiation is already present at the conception of a child in the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the effect of which is to differentiate the development of the male from the female gonadal structure with which all embryos begin.</div></blockquote>
<p>Whatever modern science can do, it cannot turn XY chromosomes into XX or vice-versa. Modern medical science can help where there are instances of genuine biological malfunction resulting in an ambiguous intersex condition. But in the case of modern (so called) 'transsexuals' it is dealing with biological healthy individuals who have psychological problems.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Paul McHugh</strong></p>
<p>Dr Paul McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital, is adamant that transgenderism or transsexualism is a "mental disorder" that merits treatment as such and that "sex change" is "biologically impossible". So people promoting sexual reassignment surgery are collaborating in promoting a mental disorder. McHugh writes:</p>
<blockquote><div>The transgendered suffer a disorder of 'assumption' like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in nature – namely one's maleness or femaleness. Other kinds of disordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and bulimia nervosa, where the assumption that departs from physical reality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are overweight.</div></blockquote>
<p>He then discusses "body dysmorphic disorder" where the assumption is "I'm ugly". With all such disorders, he says, the sufferers believe that their problems will be resolved if they change the way they appear to others. And …</p>
<blockquote><div> … such ideas work like ruling passions in their … minds and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic<em> [totally based on oneself]</em> argument. For the transgendered, this argument holds that one's feeling of 'gender' is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one's mind, cannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just society's tolerance of this 'personal truth' but affirmation of it. Here rests the support for 'transgender equality', the demands for government payment for medical and surgical treatments, and for access to all sex-based public roles and privileges <em>[such as use of opposite sex toilets, sporting classification and marriage]</em>.</div></blockquote>
<p>But this "affirmation" is resulting in child abuse, for McHugh goes on:</p>
<blockquote><div>With this argument, advocates for the transgendered have persuaded several states – including California, New Jersey and Massachusetts – to pass laws barring psychiatrists, even with parental permission, from striving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor. That government can intrude into parents' rights to seek help in guiding their children indicates how powerful these advocates have become.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>MGM – male genital mutilation ceases - (at Johns Hopkins)</strong></p>
<p>Certainly there are many problems following attempts at medical sex-reassignment with the warning lights coming from the fact that most children who report transgender feelings spontaneously lose those feelings, without medical or surgical treatment. With regard to the problems of surgical treatment, the history of Johns Hopkins University is instructive as McHugh explains:</p>
<blockquote><div>We at Johns Hopkins University – which in the 1960s was the first American medical centre to venture into "sex-reassignment surgery" – launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as 'satsified' by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn't have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex reassignment surgery, since producing a 'satisfied' but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs. It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one.</div></blockquote>
<p>The reason is this: a 2011 longitudinal (30 year) Swedish study revealed that 10 years after surgery, "the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable non-transgender population." McHugh also mentions the problems relating to requests for "reassignment" especially from, one, male prisoners who, facing long-term sentences, want the easier treatment women receive; two, young men and women susceptible to suggestion from "everything is normal" sex education, internet chat groups and "diversity" counselors in schools, who "rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery"; and, then, three, the very young – this again is abusive; these are …</p>
<blockquote><div>… often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite sex. Misguided doctors at medical centres including Boston's Children's Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty-delaying hormones to render later sex-change surgeries less onerous – even though the drugs stunt the children's growth and risk causing sterility.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The immorality of transgendering?</strong></p>
<p>How is it that we now have got to this state of affairs where treatment and surgery is inhumanely producing feminized men and masculinized women, as real sex change is impossible; and that so many say is not only foolish but morally wrong? Of course, even if there were genetic factors, it would not be a justification. It would be like alcoholism where, it is argued, there can be a genetic link. But as with alcoholism you do not want to affirm or enable the problem, but work for a cure – by helping the individual make wise choices. Morally speaking a person may well not be culpable for having a condition of what is now called "gender dysphoria" (better the old "gender identity disorder"). In the same way you may well not be culpable for a temptation to adultery or same-sex sex. But you are responsible for your response to the temptation. And wrong choices made in response to desires may well incrementally strengthen those same desires and so make them harder to resist.</p>
<p>Certainly medical and surgical transgendering is wrong because it is an intervention not to ensure bodily health but to further mental disorder and so contrary to mainstream medical ethics. Then there is the Gnostic error of saying your body, a good gift from God, is "bad" and not good for you; and saying that the real you is your mind that knows what is right - so you are denying the real created person God made you that has, and is, both a mind and a body. Then there is the biblical condemnation of intentional cross dressing as <em>"an abomination to the Lord your God"</em> in Deuteronomy 22.5. Also there is Paul's inclusion of 'malakoi' or 'soft men' in the offender list of 1 Corinthians 6.9-10. These persons can be passive partners in homosexual acts or as the New Testament scholar, Robert Gagnon, says:</p>
<blockquote><div>men who attempt to become women (through dress, mannerisms, makeup, and sometimes castration), often to attract male sex partners. The fact that Paul includes such persons among those who 'shall not inherit the kingdom of God' suggests that acting on a desire to become the opposite sex can in fact affect one's redemption.</div></blockquote>
<p>Reflection on such a person in the Church of today leads Gagnon to write:</p>
<blockquote><div>What will be the effect of encouraging church members to address persons with gender identity disorder as the sex they are not? What will be the result of requiring them to accept whatever manner of transgender display of appearance offenders deem essential to their well-being? For some it will mean silencing a conscience correctly informed by Scripture and science. For others it will cause confusion about sex and gender already promoted in the world, undermining the church's resistance to the bonds of sin.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The increase of sexual sinfulness and not speaking out</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, 21st century Christians, for a range of reasons, do not want to be heard denouncing sexual sins and homosexual and transgender sin in particular. The editorial in the Church of England Newspaper next to Peter Mullen's comments on transgenderism, began like this (under the headline Society needs the truth and reality of Christianity): "Is the Church of England exhausting its energies on inward wrangling about sex when society is desperately in need of the basic Christian message and practice and hope and purpose?"</p>
<p>But real Christianity begins with a call to repentance, trust and obedience to God for the good of society now and for a positive and wonderful eternal destiny for the future. Of course, that needs the Holy Spirit's work, but once someone is penitent and truly trusting in Christ, idols need to be destroyed that take the place of God and sexual morals need to be made pure to ensure healthy families, the building blocks of any and every society. And so, if impure sexual morals are being advocated in the Church (as seems to be happening), there will be "wrangling", and necessarily so, if there is no disciplining of, or repentance by, the immoral and their advocates. As for all sin, sexual and non-sexual, there is forgiveness through the Cross of Christ, but that is conditional on confession of the reality of one's sin.</p>
<p>Of course, Christians must love the hurting, but compassion does not mean passivity, but a desire practically to help. That great Old Testament verse that Jesus highlighted (Leviticus 19.18),</p>
<blockquote><div><em>you shall love your neighbour as yourself",</em></div></blockquote>
<p>is, on the one hand, preceded by verse 17 that says when you have a problem with your neighbour,</p>
<blockquote><div><em>you shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason frankly with your neighbour, lest you incur sin because of him".</em></div></blockquote>
<p>When he is doing or saying what is wrong, you are to try, reasonably, to correct him, if you really care for him. On the other hand, Leviticus 19.18 is sandwiched between the two main verses in the Old Testament that condemn male same sex relations as <em>"an abomination"</em> (Leviticus 18.22 and 20.13)!</p>
<p><strong>Wrong acceptance</strong></p>
<p>Today too many Christians are paralysed by a theology of "God doesn't want what you have done, but I am going to accept the situation". But in this particular case of the transgendering this means encouraging a false identity when you knowingly call a "him", a "her"; and it is a false identity which many transgendered subsequently regret and try to reverse. Also that acceptance may undermine others who are gradually getting the victory over their wrong desires for positively transgendering.</p>
<p>Of course, God alone can make a judgment regarding another person's responsibility for wrong. Nor is that person necessarily willfully rejecting God - there are sins of ignorance. But we can say objectively that certain words spoken, or deeds done, are wrong. Also, and importantly, in the case of transsexualism we need to keep in mind the hurts of the innocent who are being damaged by those who are gender identity disordered.</p>
<p>For example, Denise Schick, director of Help 4 Families Ministry, writes about her adolescence with a father obsessed with becoming a woman (a sick man and in no way to be affirmed):</p>
<blockquote><div>As an adolescent, I had to be careful about how I dressed. I always had to ask myself how he would react to my outfit. Would it make him so envious that he'd 'borrow' it (without my consent, of course)? I began to hate my body. It was a constant reminder of what my father wanted to become. When I began to wear makeup, I had to block out the images I had of him applying makeup or eye shadow or lipstick. He was destroying my desire to become a woman.</div></blockquote>
<p>And on her wedding day she says: "my dad and I were alone at the end of the hall, waiting to walk down the aisle. He looked at me in the eye and said, 'I wish it were me in that dress.'" She survived the day, she said, "knowing I was about to escape my father's terrible influences."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion – wisdom and encouragement</strong></p>
<p>In transsexualism we are talking about temptation – true temptation for very few, but very real. (Mark Yarhouse in 2015 reported the number of people who visited transgender clinics in the USA as 0.005 to 0.014 percent of men and 0.002 to 0.003 percent of women.)</p>
<p>Great wisdom regarding temptation is found in the epistle of James 1.13-15:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. The desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Great encouragement regarding temptation is found in 1 Corinthians 10.12-13:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed that he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</em></div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Part 1 of An Exhortation Against The Fear Of Death">(September 2016) Part 1 of An Exhortation Against The Fear Of Death</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2016</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p>At the time of the 16th century English Reformation, biblical sermons were provided to be read to congregations. Called 'Homilies', number 9 in the first Book of Homilies is 'An Exhortation against the Fear of Death'. It is still relevant today, with death so well-publicized but without any answer to its sad reality.</p>
<p><strong>Two Reasons Why Death Is Feared</strong></p>
<p>You should not be surprised that worldly men [or women] fear to die. For death deprives them of all worldly fame, riches, and possessions. Benefitting from these, the worldly man counts himself happy, so long as he may enjoy them as he wishes. By contrast, if he loses these with no hope of recovery, then he can only think of his unhappy state because he has lost his worldly joy and pleasure. "It's terrible," thinks such a man; "will I now be separated forever from all my fame, all my wealth; from my country, friends, money, possessions, and worldly pleasures, which are my joy and heart's delight? It will be terrible whenever that day comes when I must say 'goodbye' to all these and never enjoy any again." That is why it is not without reason that the Wise Man says: "O Death, how bitter and sour is the thought of you to a man that lives in peace and the prosperity of his possessions – to a man living without worry, living exactly as he pleases, without trouble and over-indulged and over-fed!" (Sirach. 41.1 [Apocrypha]). Then, there are other men on whom this world does not smile so kindly. Rather it distresses and oppresses them with poverty, sickness or some other adversity.<br>Yet they fear death, partly because the body naturally abhors its own dreadful disintegration that death threatens, and partly by reason of illnesses and painful conditions that mean great physical suffering. These can often come to those who are sick before they die, or may accompany dying when it comes.</p>
<p><strong>A Third And Greater Reason Why Death Is Feared</strong></p>
<p>These two reasons seem significant and weighty to a worldly man to make him fear death. However, there is another reason much greater than any of those already mentioned that, indeed, make him rightly fear death. And that is the state and condition to which, at the ultimate end, death brings all those who have their hearts fixed upon this world without repenting or amending their lives. This state and condition is called the Second Death (Rev 21.8). To this all such people will be heading after their bodily death. And this is that death which, indeed, ought to be dreaded and feared. For it is an everlasting loss, without the relief of the grace and favour of God and of everlasting joy, pleasure and happiness. It is not only the loss forever of all these eternal pleasures. But also it is the condemnation to everlasting pains in hell both of body and of soul without either appeal or hope of redemption.</p>
<p>To this state death sent the unmerciful and ungodly rich man, that Luke speaks of in his Gospel. Living in great wealth and pleasure in this world, and supplying himself daily with delicious food and expensive clothes, he despised poor Lazarus who lay pitifully at his gate, miserable, diseased and full of sores and also desperately needing food. Both these two men were arrested by death. It soon sent Lazarus, the poor miserable man, by angels to Abraham's embrace – a place of rest, pleasure, and support. But the unmerciful rich man went down into hell. And being in torment, he called for comfort, crying out from the intolerable pain that he suffered in that flame of fire. But it was too late (Luke 16.19-31). So to this place physical death sends all those who in this world have their joy and happiness - all those who in this world are faithless towards God and loveless towards their neighbours - and so die without repentance and hope of God's mercy. Therefore, it is no wonder that the worldly man fears death; in fact he has much more cause to do so than he reckons. Thus we see three reasons why worldly men fear death. One, because by it they will lose their worldly fame, wealth, possessions, and all their hearts' desires. Another reason is because of painful diseases and the suffering from a physical condition either before or at the time of death. But the chief reason above all is the dread of the miserable state of eternal damnation both of body and soul, which they fear will follow after their departure from the worldly pleasures of this present life. For these reasons all mortal men who are given to the love of this world are both in the fear and in the state of death through sin, as the holy Apostle says, so long as they live here in this world (Heb 2.15).</p>
<p><strong>The Wonderful Christian Hope</strong></p>
<p>But we must eternally give everlasting thanks to Almighty God. Neither one of these three reasons, nor all three together, can ever make a true Christian man afraid to die – a Christian who is the very member of Christ, the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 3.16; 6.19), the Son of God, and a very inheritor of the everlasting kingdom of heaven. But quite the contrary: he reckons there are many good reasons, undoubtedly grounded on the infallible and everlasting truth of the Word of God, that move him, not only to put away the fear of physical death, but also that move him positively: that is from the many benefits and unique blessings that come to every faithful person.</p>
<p>These are the reason for wishing, desiring and longing heartily for death. For it will be to him no death but a true deliverance from death - from all pains, cares and sorrows, miseries, and unhappiness of this world. It is the very entry into rest and a beginning of everlasting joy - a tasting of heavenly pleasures so many that neither tongue is able to express, neither eye to see (1 Cor 2.9), nor ear to hear them, no, nor any earthly man's heart to conceive of them. So exceedingly great benefits are they which God our heavenly Father, by his mercy alone and for the love of his Son Jesus Christ, has laid up in store and prepared for those who humbly submit themselves to God's will, and evermore truly love him from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>And we ought to believe that death, being slain by Christ, cannot keep any man that truly trusts in Christ under its everlasting tyranny and subjection. Rather he will rise from death again to glory at the last day, appointed by Almighty God, just as Christ our Head rose again according to God's appointment on the third day. For St Augustine says: "The Head going before, the members trust to follow and come after" (Enarrationes in Psalmos, 65.1). And St Paul says, <em>"If Christ be risen from the dead, we shall also rise from the same"</em> (1 Cor 15.20-23). And all Christian persons are comforted by this, that Holy Scripture calls this bodily death <em>"a sleep"</em>, in which man's senses are, as it were, taken from him for a season; and yet, when he awakes, he is more fresh than he was when he went to bed (John 11.1,13; Acts 7.60; 1 Thess 4.13-18). So, although we have our souls separated from our bodies for a season, yet at the General Resurrection we shall be more fresh, attractive and perfect than we are now. For now we are mortal; then we shall be immortal; now infected with various infirmities; then clearly without all mortal infirmities; now we are subject to all carnal desires; then we shall be entirely spiritual, desiring nothing but God's glory and things eternal.</p>
<p><strong>Death The Door To Life</strong></p>
<p>So this bodily death is a door for entering into life, and therefore not so much to be dreaded, if it be rightly considered, as something for our comfort. It is not an evil, but a remedy for all evils - no enemy, but a friend; not a cruel tyrant, but a gentle guide; leading us not to mortality, but to immortality; not to sorrow and pain, but to joy and pleasure. And all that is to continue forever, if death is thankfully taken and received as God's messenger, and patiently borne by us loving Christ, who suffered most painful death loving us to redeem us from Eternal Death. Regarding this St Paul says, <em>"Our life is hid with Christ in God, but when our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory"</em> (Col 3.3-4).</p>
<p>Why then shall we fear to die, considering the manifold and comfortable promises of the Gospel and of Holy Scripture? <em>"God the Father hath given us everlasting life,"</em> says St John, <em>"and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son hath not life."</em> And, <em>"this I wrote,"</em> says St John, <em>"to you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have everlasting life and that you do believe upon the name of the Son of God"</em> (1 John 5.11-13). And our Saviour Christ says, <em>"He that believeth in me hath life everlasting, and I will raise him from death to life at the last day"</em> (John 6.40,47). St Paul also says, that <em>"Christ is ordained and made of God our righteousness, our holiness and redemption, to the intent that he which will glory should glory in the Lord"</em> (1 Cor 1.30-31). St Paul rejected and set little store by<em> "all other things, esteeming them as dung, which before he had in very great price, that he might be found in Christ"</em> (Phil 3.7-11) for the sake of everlasting life, true holiness, righteousness and redemption.</p>
<p><strong>St Paul's Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Finally, St Paul argues plainly like this: <em>"If our heavenly Father would not spare his own natural Son, but did give him to death for us, how can it be that with him he should not give us all things"</em> (Rom 8.32)? Therefore, if we have Christ, then we have, with him and by him, all those good things that in our hearts we can wish or desire, such as victory over death, sin and hell; and we have the favour of God, peace with him, holiness, wisdom, justice, power, life, and redemption; and we have by him everlasting health, wealth, joy and bliss everlasting.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Belief in God">(October 2016) Belief in God</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2016</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Is it Reasonable?</strong></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul argues in the New Testament that belief in God is utterly reasonable. In fact it is so reasonable and so in accord with common sense that a failure to face this truth has consequences – serious consequences. He writes in Romans 1:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth</em> [about God, our creator]<em>.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>He then immediately explains why:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse." </em>(Romans 1.18-20)</div></blockquote>
<p>That is not just a New Testament perspective; it is an Old Testament perspective as well. So writes King David, in a Psalm attributed to him:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.</em>(Psalm 19.1)</div></blockquote>
<p>But what about the modern world and the 21st century? Is our amazing universe as now understood still able to convince? The answer is, "Yes, most certainly." Take Sir Fred Hoyle (1915-2001), the British astronomer and cosmologist. As a younger man he was a militant atheist and was able to find theoretical support both for his atheism and for the remarkable "coincidences" necessary for the emergence and conservation of human life. But ultimately what has been called in astrophysics, "the atheist's dilemma", changed Hoyle's thinking. The dilemma says that "either there are monstrous coincidences of fine tuning in nature, or there is purpose in the universe." This led to Hoyle writing in later life as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics… The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.</div></blockquote>
<p>That was written back in 1981. In 2016 Roger Wagner and Andrew Briggs in their elegant book, just published, <em>'The Penultimate Curiosity – how science swims in the slipstream of ultimate questions'</em>, point out that …</p>
<blockquote><div>… in the years that followed Hoyle's discovery many other 'fine tunings' have been identified in the basic constants of reality, all of which were necessary for what another Cambridge cosmologist, Martin Rees, has called a "biophilic" <em>[life friendly]</em> universe to exist. To ascribe them to chance has seemed increasingly problematic.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is it Sufficient?</strong></p>
<p>However, is it enough just to believe that God exists? According to the letter of James the answer is, "No!" For, he says, belief in God needs to result in some positive outcome in a person's life. So he writes for someone whose faith does not lead to life changes as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe – and shudder!</em>(James 2.19)</div></blockquote>
<p>What more, then, is needed? First, we need an understanding of the nature of God. But what does that mean? Well, the problem today is far less the problem of the likes of Richard Dawkins and the younger Hoyle saying the Christian faith is unreasonable; rather, the problem today (as often down the centuries) relates much more to what God is like and how that affects us. Here is a robust statement of the problem by the theologian, R. C. Sproul, writing in a forward to the book, <em>'Whatever happened to the Reformation?'</em>:</p>
<blockquote><div>As far as I am concerned, the greatest issue facing the Christian church as we move into the twenty-first century is the character of God. Unless we recommit ourselves to understand who God is and what he is like, nothing else in the Bible will make sense. Apart from understanding God's justice, wrath, mercy and holiness, there is no way we can understand the gospel. The cross will make no sense to us if we do not understand why God's character required it. But if you understand the character of God, then not only does the gospel make sense, but the doctrines of Scripture, Christ, and everything else fall into place.</div></blockquote>
<p>All this is in line with the letter to the Hebrews where it says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Without faith it is impossible to please him </em>[God]<em>, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards </em>[literally, 'pays wages to']<em> those who seek him.</em>(Hebrews 11.6)</div></blockquote>
<p>And that is in line with Romans 6.23 that says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Both of these statements simply follow from the fundamental and classic formulation of the nature of God. This was given by God himself to the early Israelite leader, Moses, during an awe inspiring theophany, at a cardinal time in the history of our planet, and as recorded in the book of Exodus:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.</em>(Exodus 34.6-7)</div></blockquote>
<p>It is so clear. The real God, the creator of this unfathomable universe of space and time, is merciful and gracious – a God of true and genuine love. However, he is also committed to justice - <em>"by no means clearing the guilty"</em>. This is so hard for many to understand in the 21st century. It seems unloving that retribution (for such it is) should be essential to being just.&nbsp;But fair retribution is no more than making the punishment fit the crime. Mercy is somehow ensuring more leniency. Mercy, therefore, is meaningless without some fair standard whose outcome it softens. Also unless there is some concept of fair retribution, there is no limit to what you can do in terms of deterrence (for example, torture for minimal offences) or in terms of reformation (long incarceration in psychiatric hospitals for minimal offences). The punishment has to be "just", for the Bible and common moral sense witness to a moral order where some offences or sins are "worse" than others and deserve stiffer penalties. Armed robbery is worse than parking your car in the wrong place!&nbsp;Why this is so important is because divine judgment and retribution is at the heart of the Christian "gospel" – or good news. For Jesus Christ, as our Saviour, at the Cross of Calvary, mercifully bore the divine judgment (or wrath or retribution) for sin that would otherwise have fairly been visited on us.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, Belief in God</strong></p>
<p>In the Apostles' Creed, "I believe in God" is literally "I believe into God". It is more than "belief that God exists and has a certain character", necessary as that is, for it is a faith commitment to the God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit – one God in three persons. But what does that commitment involve? Paul wrote:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</em>(Romans 10.9)</div></blockquote>
<p>You need to confess publicly that Jesus is the divine Son - the Lord (and your Lord whom you obey). And you need to believe that he left a tomb empty that first Easter morning. For the resurrection of Jesus proves he was the divine Son, the second person of the Trinity; it proves that as by faith we unite with the risen Jesus, by his Holy Spirit we can have new life; also it proves his death really was in our place for our sins. So you will be saved by faith in Jesus Christ the Lord. Salvation means, regarding the past, your sins will be forgiven; regarding the present, you will have a new start in your spiritual life; and regarding the future, you will have a wonderful hope of resurrection life and heaven. Yes, Jesus Christ will come again. However, this time not for salvation but for judgment!</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Trump Enigma">(December 2016) The Trump Enigma</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2016</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Pollsters</strong></p>
<p>Time magazine for 21 November was a unique edition about Donald Trump. In it polling analyst, Frank Luntz, writes this:</p>
<blockquote><div>It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does it? President-elect Donald J Trump. A campaign that began with him blithely riding down an escalator ends with him boldly ascending to the highest office in the land. Polls missed it. Pundits dismissed it. Prognosticators blew it. For decades, millions upon millions of Americans have felt looked down upon and left behind. They were as mad as hell. On Nov. 8, they declared in unison: Enough … But it wasn't just the polls that were off. Never has the political class/industry/elite so misread the electorate and so misunderstood American priorities. The echo chamber of journalists, politicians and corporate leaders and the international community kept reassuring itself that there was no way 'a man like him' could win, even in times like these. The American people decided differently. They did it the British Brexit way, using this election as a vessel to vent their anger against All Things Big.</div></blockquote>
<p>So what particularly had the polls missed?</p>
<p><strong>The Media</strong></p>
<p>"The media is rigged" was a chant of Trump on the election trail. 'Bias' is probably the right word for why the media missed so much - simple bias from many mainstream journalists, who are secular conformists and so, while intelligent, quite ignorant of the Christian faith. In the UK it is probably even worse than in the US. We have now such a secular Government-controlled broadcast media. A relevant and classic example of bias sticks in my mind. It occurred on the night of President Obama's first election. The BBC journalist on the BBC live coverage, when Obama seemed to be in the lead, exclaimed excitedly, "We're winning". So much for the BBC's impartiality! The journalist was Justin Webb, then the North American Editor for BBC News (he now is a mainstay of the BBC4's <em>Today</em> programme).</p>
<p>Such partiality then means key embarrassing facts regarding favoured candidates are ignored. For example, in the last Trump broadcast debate with Hillary Clinton, two things were not cited as significant in the immediate 'news' reaction. One was the gruesome issue of partial-birth abortion, with Clinton saying she was in favour, while Trump was totally against. It was a substantive exchange with Trump saying, if elected, he would appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court who could change the abortion law. Then, secondly, there was no mention of the exchange regarding the 'wall along the Mexican border'. Trump alleged that Clinton was also in favour of such a wall. Nor did she deny it, but tried to wriggle out of the accusation. I subsequently discovered that in 2006, as a senator from New York, Clinton had voted for the Secure Fence Act authorizing 700 miles of fence for one third of the border which is now in place. Also subsequently I saw a <em>BBC</em> programme on the border. It featured a journalist accompanied by a local Hispanic lady, showing some of the unprotected areas where the local lady never dared go and where armed police roaming in cars have to face gun-battles with violent drug runners. It seemed from the programme that proper entry points were needed. I discovered Clinton had also 'wriggled' in January 2016 saying,</p>
<blockquote><div>I voted for border security and some of it was a fence. I don't think we ever called it a wall.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>81 Percent of Evangelicals Voted for Trump</strong></p>
<p>But the question remains, how do you explain the election result? It certainly has something to do with why 81 percent of Evangelicals, a huge proportion, voted for Trump. For at the end of the 20th century so many Evangelical Christians had formed the 'moral majority'. These were those who stood politically for 'family values' and sexual morality. But "how," asked the Evangelical theologian, Albert Mohler, "could 'family values voters' support a man who had, among other things, stated openly that no man's wife was safe with him in a room? A casino titan who posed for the cover of Playboy magazine? A man who boasted that he did not repent of his (well-documented) sins and would not?" The answer Mohler gave was, two words, "Hillary Clinton." So if Trump was bad, she must have been reckoned as very bad by many. But why? The answer is her moral views and decisions.</p>
<p>Mainstream secular journalists, in such as <em>Time,</em> <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Times</em> and on the <em>BBC</em> failed, and fail, to realize the great significance of the Evangelical and not least the Pentecostal vote (Pentecostals often being black rather than white). Because of his racist remarks, many black Pentecostals, unlike their white Christian brothers and sisters, would have been unable to 'hold their noses' and vote for Trump. But this time, for moral reasons, they would not have voted democrat as before, because of Clinton's, to the Christian, globally shocking policies. So they would not have voted or voted for another candidate, thus providing one reason for her loss of the black vote. Let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>Righteous Anger</strong></p>
<p>Apart from abortion, there were and are Clinton's views and actions over so called LGBT rights – 'gay' rights. And the mainstream media have, without reason, made this a primary value. So journalists fail to see how angry Christians in the West now are with anti-Christian, secular Governments enforcing on Christians these rights which they strongly believe to be 'wrongs'; and so called 'gay marriage' is seen, at the civilization level, as particularly corrupting and pernicious. But in the run-up to the election in the United States, the imposition by President Obama of 'transgender rights' for many (and not just Christians) was a bridge too far. Obama's enforcing schools to allow boys to sleep in girls' rooms on away trips and to use their toilets and showers if they claim to want to be girls (and vice versa) is seen as trumping Trump for sexual abuse – his being adult, this being child, sex-abuse. No wonder North Carolina voted Republican and for Trump. The State had defied Obama's imposition and then had been punished with all sorts of sanctions and threats.</p>
<p>But Hillary Clinton has been a prime-mover in this decadence. Exactly five years ago, on 6 December 2011, these headlines appeared in <em>The New York Times</em>, "US to Aid gay rights abroad Obama and Clinton say." Hillary Clinton was then Secretary of State and so the chief promoter. The article went on:</p>
<blockquote><div>The Obama administration announced on Tuesday that the United States would use all the tools of American diplomacy, including the potent enticement of foreign aid, to promote gay rights around the world.</div></blockquote>
<p>As a trustee of AID (Anglican International Development) I have been involved in the setting up of a progamme of training desperately needed South Sudanese health workers. Because of the current sad political and dangerous situation in the South Sudan the programme has had to be transferred to, and hosted in, the Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. When two summers ago, Dr Rose Mutumba, the Hospital Medical Director, came to Jesmond with the Programme Director to report to me, as chairman of AID, I discovered the following: Dr Rose was having to lay-off half the staff in her 60 strong Aids clinic in the Mengo hospital, where 75% of the funding was from USAID; and she would have money only to last until Christmas. The reason? The funding was being withdrawn following an invasion by USAID workers with clipboards, going round her staff asking their views on homosexual relationships. We thank God that on visiting the hospital last May, I learnt that as a result of strong action by angry US Christians, the money somehow came back via another route. But who do you think those US Christians voted for on Nov. 8?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The answer probably is some stayed at home; some, like one American pastor I know, voted for another candidate; but the 81 percent, probably were voting for what they judged the morally least worse. But what should we do in the UK? Of course, pray at least that Mr. Trump keeps his good promises better than he kept his promises to two women called 'Mrs. Trump'. Finally, we should note these words from one American Christian on this election:</p>
<blockquote><div>It's more of a reaction than a renewal … Ordinary citizens are complicit in all of the appetites and short-sightedness of liberal consumer democracy. Voters have merely tapped the brakes. The direction of the car hasn't changed. Conversion – real conversion of heart and behaviour – was not on this year's ballot … One of two deeply flawed candidates is now the president-elect. It is a good moment to remember that we're Christians first and political animals second. Our task now is to support the good in Mr. Trump's policies and to resist the bad" (Francis Maier).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="The Turning of the Tide?

                                                <p><strong>The Facts</strong></p>
<p>The International Bulletin of Mission Research (IBMR) reported last year (2016) the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>In 2014, a significant milestone in world Christianity went unnoticed. For the first time ever, Latin America passed Europe <em>[including Russia]</em> as the continent with the most Christians. Note that in 1900 Europe had six times as many Christians as Latin America. Looking ahead to 2025, we see that Latin America is likely to be surpassed by Africa, with 628 million in the former and more than 700 million in the later. We also project that by 2050, Asia will surpass Europe in the number of Christians. Each of the three continents in the Global South could outnumber Europe, together representing nearly 80% of all Christians (from just over 20% in 1900).</div></blockquote>
<p>Also you can read in the IBMR that by 2050 36% of the World population should be Christian while 28% should be Muslim (i.e. together nearly two thirds of the entire world). The great decline is in the unaffiliated (atheists, agnostics and those who do not identify with any religion). It is predicted that they will shrink as a percentage of the world's population (from 16% in 2010 to 13% in 2050).</p>
<p>In all this the key figures are the world-wide growth trends. From 2000 to mid-2016 while the global population was growing at 1.19%, Christian growth was 1.30% (but Muslim growth was 1.87%). That 1.30%, as you would expect, marks radical differences. For while African Christians grew at 2.79%, Asians at 2.19% and Latin America at 1.19% in North America it was 0.56% and in Europe a mere 0.14% (with I suspect much of that small growth due to immigration). However, from 2000 to 2016 the world-wide growth for Non-religionists is 0.31%; for Agnostics 0.36%; and Atheists 0.05% with a permanent numerical decline for Atheists now predicted while, of course, the world population grows.</p>
<p><strong>The Wrong Side of History</strong></p>
<p>It certainly looks from a global perspective that Western secular extremism, now in the driving seat, with its anti-Christian "religion of me" is nearing the end of its shelf life and already on the wrong side of history. And certainly it looks as though from the 2016 Western election results something is being rejected. With Catholics waking up in France and Evangelicals in America, there is some sort of common-sense revival against the legitimizing of any and every form of consensual sexual aberration, family patterning and self-harm (including drunkenness and drug abuse).</p>
<p>At the time of writing I read in The Times newspaper that a student at Newcastle University, being initiated into the Agric Society, "got really drunk and they didn't realize he had stopped breathing until it was too late." So, just before Christmas he "died at the Royal Victoria Infirmary … after 18 hours on a life support machine with his parents at his bedside." But that terrible tragedy was one of hundreds of thousands of the fruits of a pervasive philosophy of life and culture that is utterly foolish and cruel.</p>
<p>This culture has been imposed since the 1960's by, what sociologists call, the "new class". These are those who control in Western societies symbolic information – Government agencies, the educational empire, the therapeutic services and, because of the BBC, the media, with all having a vested interest in centralism, because centrally funded. Sadly, as corporate entities they have been major contributors to the emergence of a world gone wrong. They have given rise to this notion of self idolatry, 'the religion of me', where I am to define what it means to be human and to 'find myself'. Philip Rieff, in his Triumph of the Therapeutic, brilliantly describes this philosophy, or 'religion of me', as the creed that,</p>
<blockquote><div>we can live freely at last, enjoying all our senses – except the sense of the past – as unremembering, honest, and friendly barbarians all, in a technological Eden.</div></blockquote>
<p>For a host of reasons this philosophy has had amazing permanence. But at last people are realizing that the lone individual needs significant others, in stable families, as the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, taught and certainly the Bible teaches. And families need to be in wider societies which have to have some common philosophy and notion of the common good, other than that a consensus (or democracy) itself is a common good. Normal human beings want a consensus about the truth or what is actually good and beneficial for society. Societies cannot be infinitely pluralistic.</p>
<p><strong>Things are Changing</strong></p>
<p>But things are changing. Certainly the reality of populist movements suggest so. What the British Referendum result in June 2016 to leave the EU hinted might be the case, the November 2016 US Presidential election result seems to have confirmed. So what is going on? The answer may be clearer from considering the other side of the Atlantic when American electioneering was getting to white-heat. For here is how Walter Russell Mead summarized the situation – writing, note, in May 2016, long before the election of Trump, when he was seriously unpopular and unattractive to the punditocracy:</p>
<blockquote><div>But this apparent weakness and vulnerability conceals a strength: Trump is an unconventional candidate whose proposition to the electorate isn't about particular stands, experience, credentials or even personal and political honesty. Trump is the purest expression of the politics of 'No!" that I personally can recall. He's the candidate for people who think the conventional wisdom of the American establishment is hopelessly out of touch with the real world. He's the little boy saying that the emperor, or in this case, the aspiring empress, has no clothes. What energizes the Trump phenomenon is the very power of rejection: people who think the train is about to head off a cliff want to pull the emergency cord that stops the train even if they don't know what happens next. To many of Trump supporters, Hillary Clinton looks like Nurse Ratched in <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em>:&nbsp;the enforcer of a fatally flawed status quo and the personification of bureaucratic power in a system gone rogue.What makes Trump so appealing to so many voters is that the establishment does seem unusually clueless these days. The great American post–Cold War project of seeking peace and security through the construction of a New World Order based on liberal internationalism and American power doesn't seem to be working very well, and it's not hard to conclude that neither the neoconservatives nor the Obama-ites really know what they are doing. When it comes to the economy, it's been clear since the financial crisis of 2008 that something is badly awry and that the economists, so dogmatic and opinionated and so bitterly divided into quarrelling schools, aren't sure how the system works anymore, and have no real ideas about how to make the world system work to the benefit of ordinary voters in the United States. With the PC crowd and the Obama administration hammering away at transgender bathroom [toilet] rights as if this was the great moral cause of our time, and with campus Pure Thought advocates collapsing into self-parody even as an epidemic of drug abuse and family breakdown relentlessly corrodes the foundations of American social cohesion, it's hard to believe that the establishment has a solid grip on the moral principles and priorities a society like ours needs.</div></blockquote>
<p>The writer of these comments was expecting Hilary Clinton to be elected. Also he was not confident that,</p>
<blockquote><div>burning down the old house is the best way to build something new. But it would be equally wrong and perhaps more dangerous to take the view that there is nothing more fueling <em>[Trump's]</em> rise than ignorance, racism and hate".</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>How are we to respond to all that is happening? Many American Evangelicals, who helped the election result, responded by seeing this as, in Franklin Graham's words, "one of the most stunning victories in the history of Western democracy" and claiming it was because "hundreds of thousands of Christians from across the US had been praying." I, also, respond by remembering Psalm 146.3-5:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation. When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish. Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>I quoted, in December (to which this January Coloured Supplement is a sequel): "one of two deeply flawed candidates is now the president-elect" (F. Maier). So the good in Trump's policies needs to be supported while the bad resisted.</p>
<p>But, it needs also to be said, that if Trump is a bellwether for the Western world (America currently being a 'lead society'), we must expect changes eventually to come in Britain. And if what is happening is a revolt, for a range of reasons, against the decadent and divisive culture and politics of the West, it is not enough to say "No!" There needs to be a positive vision to which people say "Yes"! So this presents Christian people with a great opportunity to fill a dangerous vacuum that could be filled by what is worse rather than by what is better. So next month (February) I hope to suggest ways forward for recovering our Christian roots, and that are in line with our vision of 'Changing Britain'.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Turning of the Tide?

                                                <p><strong>The Reality</strong></p>
<p>On the 20th January 2017, Donald J Trump became President of the United States of America. His inaugural message gave rise to this headline in Time magazine: "The new President reverses course on a century of U.S. leadership." Trump, with his concern for "America First", wants to be more of a national executive than the leader of the free world. But then came the demonization and some violence in response. Clare Poges (formerly David Cameron's speech writer) comments:</p>
<blockquote><div>millions are in the grip of Traumatic Trump Syndrome … Of course, we are entitled to feel concerned by some of his policies, not least the three-month suspension of arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries … Strangely there was not the same outcry when Obama banned refugees from Iraq for six months in 2011.</div></blockquote>
<p>Nor, we should note, was there an outcry when Hilary Clinton voted successfully for the start of the Mexican wall in the 2006 Secure Fence Act resulting in 700 miles of the wall having been built already.&nbsp;So what was and is going on? After all, 60 million people democratically voted for Trump, who was judged by them the best of two very flawed candidates; and he is doing just what he told the electorate he would do. Why such vitriol?</p>
<p>In simple terms Trump is rolling back aspects of the extreme secular culture that progressives thought was theirs by right and have been promoting for the last eight years. According to one commentator, Richard Merry, they have never addressed five reasons why Trump is where he is. First is his blowing apart a political correctness that curbs free speech and rational discussion. Secondly, there is his concern over illegal and uncontrolled immigration that among other things can destroy a nation's values, culture and freedoms (which in the US have a Christian basis). Thirdly, he wants to stop blue-collar middle-class poverty with its attendant social havoc of divorce, alcoholism, drug use and crime. Fourthly, he is a nationalist and so an internationalist rather than a cosmopolitan globalist. And the fifth reason for his election is the coarsening of American culture. Since the sixties there has been an assault on traditional sexual morality and marriage and an increase in drug use, bad language in the media and pornography. All this helped pave the way for Trump's own rude and crude language and allowed the other four factors to secure his election.</p>
<p><strong>Culture War</strong></p>
<p>Behind everything are fundamental questions of life – what is its meaning and how should you live? For many of the anti-Trumpers that meaning comes from the contemporary secular philosophy, popularly called "The Religion of Me." Its roots are in the 18th century Franco-German Enlightenment that taught that if there is a God, he is distant from this world and certainly doesn't interfere in it. Furthermore, there is no such thing as "sin", for man is, in principle, good and not bad, and is perfectible through evolution or education.</p>
<p>Two centuries and two World Wars later, when this deism had morphed into plain atheism, in 1947 this philosophy led the famous French philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, to publish his book <em>Existentialism</em> in which he said this:</p>
<blockquote><div>If I've discarded God the father, there has to be someone to invent values … To say that we invent values means nothing else but this: life has no meaning a priori. Before you come alive, life is nothing, its up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing else but the meaning that you choose.</div></blockquote>
<p>And that existentialism combined with fashionable Marxism gave rise to an entire sexual revolution 20 years later. For, by now, it was argued that the true "me" is made up of my instincts that are inherently good and so must be expressed and not suppressed. Influential in 1972 was the best-seller, <em>Open Marriage</em>, by Nena and George O'Neill, which in a few paragraphs opened a new door to marital infidelity. That was soon followed by a clever, but to many shocking, drive to normalize homosexual acts that became an obsession with people like Hillary Clinton and David Cameron. However, in America more than in Britain, there was organized resistance. Rich Lowry reports:</p>
<blockquote><div>A fight has raged here since the 1970s over such issues as abortion, school prayer, traditional sexual mores, gay rights, religious displays on public property, pornography, graphic content in television shows and movies and school curriculums. The combatants have been, roughly speaking, secular coastal elites on the one hand and a religious heartland on the other.</div></blockquote>
<p>This "fight" put the brakes on the secular landslide. But President Obama's election in 2008 signalled full speed ahead in the previous direction.</p>
<blockquote><div>Traditional marriage continued to decline, the entertainment culture got more coarse and old-fashioned sexual morality became the stuff of mockery. The rout on gay marriage has been so complete, with the Supreme Court making gay marriage legal throughout the land, that the left has moved on to the new cause of transgender rights.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Christian View</strong></p>
<p>Then came Trump. He is hardly a Christian culture warrior with his record regarding women and wives. But what he has done is to change the agenda of the culture war. He accepts gay marriage and allows transgenderism but is anti-abortion. However, he is concerned with general issues such as defeating political correctness; changing a biased mainstream media; and restoring the nation to its proper place as an essential social unit for business and as a culture carrier helping to maintain virtues and values, something a global culture cannot do.</p>
<p>But how should Christians react to a leader such as Mr Trump? The apostles Paul and Peter are of help. First, Paul says, we are to <em>"be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God"</em> (Rom. 13.1). Secondly, as Paul goes on to say,<em> "one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience"</em> (Rom. 13.5) or <em>"for the Lord's sake"</em> (1 Peter 2.13). So one obeys not only because of the governor's power (wrath) but because of "conscience" – because it is right, not merely prudent, to obey. Thirdly, that means that Mr Trump has a genuine God-given authority, not just power. And that is why a "governor" should be "honoured" (Rom 13.7; 1 Peter 2.17) - not because he is a nice man, which he may or may not be, but as we "honour" parents, because they have God's authority. Fourthly, Mr Trump's job along with his Government is to <em>"to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good"</em> (1 Peter 2.13). And, fifthly, Mr Trump's job along with his Government is also to work for a polity where citizens can <em>"lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way"</em> (1 Tim 2.2) - "godly" is being right with God, "dignified" is being right at the human level.</p>
<p>However, John's vision in Revelation 13 of a great blasphemous beast (traditionally understood as Rome at a time of Christians being persecuted) is also important. It prefigures all evil totalitarian rulers or Governments. Instead of punishing those who do evil and praising those who do good, Governments may punish those who do good and praise those who do evil. Such an evil doer must be disobeyed when you are required to do what God forbids, or forbidden to do what God requires. As <em>"Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'"</em> (Acts 5.29). But Trump is in no way such a ruler. Therefore, he has to be "honoured". That should happen in the US, as the Traumatic Trump Syndrome dies down. Then changes will take place, which because of our Special Relationship are bound to affect post-Brexit Britain. This, then, is an ideal time in both the US and Britain for evangelism and church growth. For however much you may dislike aspects of his agenda, Trump, having made some good appointments, is causing cracks in the godless mainstream secular culture.</p>
<p><strong>Our Agenda</strong></p>
<p>Godly Living – praying comes first, for President Trump and Mrs May that both may seek God's will for our nations and praying for their own godly living. And pray at this strategic time that all of us <em>"seek first God's kingdom"</em> in all areas of our lives in accordance with our verses for the year, Matthew 6.33-34.</p>
<p>Church Growth – prayer and appropriate action is needed for our Founders' vision of "the maintenance and promulgation of sound, scriptural and evangelical truth". For "maintenance", at this time of serious sexualization and compromise in the Church of England, we need prayer for the Holy Spirit's power, compassion and courage to help those with various confusions (Jude 20-23); and for "promulgation", prayer for the Holy Spirit's guidance as we need radical changes in the Church of England for evangelism and church planting.</p>
<p>Changing Britain – in this Lutheran 500th anniversary year, let's pray for a new Lutheran confidence, one, that God is there and in control; two, that the new nationalism is "under God" and open to peaceful, moral, non-violent migrants and not a dangerous godless nationalism; and, three, that, as we can, we graciously, firmly and openly apply our faith in Christ in the wider world as<em> "salt and light"</em> (Matt 5.13-14) and we, too, help roll back the godless secular culture.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Reformation in the Nation and Church">(March 2017) Reformation in the Nation and Church</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p>The Jesmond Conference 2017 at the end of February for clergy, church workers, charity leaders and educationalists was entitled, "Reformation in the Nation and Church" (the talks are all available on Clayton TV). The first session's subject was "The need for a new Reformation in the year of the 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation in response to what is happening in the wider world and church." Below is an extract from the second half of my 20 minute introductory talk. This came after detailing some facts about the wider world that show we obviously need a new Reformation.</p>
<p><strong>The Figures</strong></p>
<p>But do the figures suggest there are specific problems to be addressed? The answer is most certainly, "Yes!" The problems are evident when examining some statistics. For the evidence is that those churches committed to basic biblical faith (Jesmond's "sound scriptural and evangelical truth", which in fact is the Christian faith as established by law for the Church of England), and those in other denominations committed to the same theological understanding, will be, on average, seeing growth.</p>
<p>There was a recent five year longitudinal survey entitled, <em>Theology Matters: Comparing the Traits of Growing and Declining Mainline Protestant Church attendees</em>. It was published after contacting 2,225 churchgoers and surveying 29 clergy and 195 folk from the pews. And according to David Haskell, the study's lead researcher:</p>
<blockquote><div>If we are talking solely about what belief system is more likely to lead to numerical growth among Protestant churches, the evidence suggests conservative Protestant theology is the clear winner … The researchers compared the beliefs and practices of congregations and clergy at mainline Protestant churches whose attendances were growing with declining churches. On all measures, the growing churches 'held more firmly to the traditional beliefs of Christianity and were more diligent in things like prayer and Bible reading'.</div></blockquote>
<p>Among the key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 50% of clergy from declining churches agreed it was "very important to encourage non-Christians to become Christians", compared to 100% of clergy from growing churches.

</li>
<li>71% of clergy from growing churches read the Bible daily compared with 19% from declining churches.

</li>
<li>46% of people attending growing churches read the Bible once a week compared with 26% from declining churches.

</li>
<li>93% of clergy and 83% of worshippers from growing churches agreed with the statement "Jesus rose from the dead with a real flesh-and-blood body leaving behind an empty tomb".
<p>This compared with 67% of worshippers and 56% of clergy from declining churches.</p>

</li>
<li>100% of clergy and 90% of worshippers agreed that "God performs miracles in answer to prayers", compared with 80% of worshippers and 44% of clergy from declining churches.

</li>
<li>The study also found that about two-thirds of congregations at growing churches were under the age of 60, whereas two thirds of congregations at declining churches were over 60.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with all these challenges in the world and the church, what has Luther to say to us in this anniversary year of 2017? For any not knowing, let me first give you a brief summary of his life.</p>
<p><strong>Luther's Life and Theology</strong></p>
<p>Born on 10 November 1483, he had a good education ending up at the University of Erfurt. Luther then entered an Augustinian monastery in Erfurt at the age of twenty-two. In 1508 he was made Professor at the new University of Wittenberg where he remained more or less until his death in 1546. While lecturing there his doubts as to his own salvation were resolved through studying Paul's letter to the Galatians. Then in 1517 he posted his 95 theses on that church door in Wittenberg that included an attack on the false assurance of indulgences (money you could pay the Church to release you from purgatory). And so began the Reformation.</p>
<p>Luther then discovered that the Christian life was one of conflict – soon conflict against the Pope and the Emperor, then against the clever but weak Erasmus, then against the Radical Reformers, and then against the Peasants with their rebellion who jumped on the Reformation band-wagon and, in spite of some justifiable grievances, Luther saw as harming its cause.</p>
<p>So how can Luther help us today? I believe it is, first and foremost, by, one, his belief in God and the centrality of Christ – so relevant for our Islamic friends; two, his strategy and the resulting energy he put into the Reformation cause; and, three, his tone when necessary – he could call a spade.</p>
<p>Carl Trueman, I think has got it right. He is a Reformation scholar who sees the value of Luther, and the Reformers, in these terms:</p>
<blockquote><div>It is only to the extent that they brought God and Christ to bear upon the Church of their day that the Reformers have any ongoing relevance for us today. Luther himself hinted at this when he described the difference between himself and his precursors, John Wycliffe and John Hus. They, he said, attacked the morals of the papacy, but he attacked its theology. It is vital to grasp this: Luther's crusade was not ultimately a moral one; it was theological. Of course, the two are intimately related. His attack on indulgences in 1517 was in large part an attack on abusive pastoral practice driven by church greed; but it was also rooted in his changing theology which saw the sale of indulgences as cheapening God's grace, trivializing sin and misleading the laity. He did not attack the practice simply because it was abusive in its practical out-workings but because it rested upon a false view of God and of humanity's status before God.</div></blockquote>
<p>Trueman argues that a recovery of the doctrine of God will result in a recovery of one, understanding Christ's work for us on the Cross for our justification through faith; two, the Bible; and three, the doctrine of assurance. Luther's doctrine of God, therefore, requires that we pray for all those things. How much we pray, of course, will reflect our belief about God.</p>
<p>And may I say that in this anniversary year, a good way to remind yourself of Luther and his theology, or to introduce yourself to it, is to read The Bondage of the Will and in the translation of, and with the introduction by, J I Packer and Raymond Johnston (former Church Warden of Jesmond Parish Church).</p>
<p>To conclude let me give you two non controversial quotes, as a taster, from Luther. First, Luther on God's grace and how it works:</p>
<blockquote><div>All the many countless blessings which God gives us here on earth are merely those gifts which last for a time. But His grace and loving regard are the inheritance which endures throughout eternity…In giving us such gifts here on earth He is giving us only those things that are his own, but in this grace and love towards us He gives his very self. In receiving his gifts we touch but his hand; but in His gracious regard we receive His heart, His spirit, His mind, His will.Man receives grace immediately and fully. In this way He is saved. Good works are not necessary to assist Him in this: they follow. It is as if God were to produce a fresh, green tree out of a dry log, which tree would then bear its natural fruit.</div></blockquote>
<p>And finally here is Luther, so sane, on the normal Christian life:</p>
<blockquote><div>This life is not a state of being righteous, but rather, of growth in righteousness; not a state of being healthy, but a period of healing; not a state of being but becoming; not a state of rest, but of exercise and activity.We are not yet what we shall be, but we grow towards it; the process is not yet finished, but is still going on; this life is not the end, it is the way to a better.All does not yet shine with glory; nevertheless, all is being purified.</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="7th Century Lessons from the North East for the Evangelization of Britain in the 21st Century">(April 2017) 7th Century Lessons from the North East for the Evangelization of Britain in the 21st Century</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p>The following is an edited extract from my 20 minute introductory talk at the fourth session of this year's February Jesmond Conference.</p>
<p><strong>7th Century Missions</strong></p>
<p>The lessons actually have their roots in the early 5th century (AD) when the Roman legions had left Britain to defend the Empire nearer home; and, also, the lessons began in Celtic Ireland, not the North East of England, with Patrick who was born in 390 and who in 432 was a missionary bishop for Ireland. Amazingly before his death Ireland had become a Christian country. Patrick died in 461. However, his work bore more and significant fruit 100 years later. For in the 6th century, in 563, a wider Celtic missionary movement was launched from Ireland by Columba, who founded a monastery on Iona, an island off the west coast of Scotland, that then became a centre for evangelizing Scotland.</p>
<p>The next important initiative as far as Britain was concerned was in 597, 34 years later. That was when there was a new Italian, or Roman, missionary initiative. It began small with Pope Gregory (590-604) sending a team under Augustine (not to be confused with the great Augustine, Bishop of Hippo) to the south of England. He was to establish diocesan structures and with provincial archbishoprics in London and York, following the pattern of government left by the Roman legions nearly two centuries earlier. Augustine saw people converted and he established bishoprics in London and Rochester. But, sadly, in 616 in the face of a pagan resurgence the bishops of London and Rochester had to flee across the Channel. Paulinus, however, who had joined Augustine's team, went up to York in 625 and was involved in the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria. But, sadly, that mission too was short-lived. For with Edwin's death in 633, pagans gained control of Northumbria and Paulinus had to flee south. So by the early 630s, forty years after its start, the Roman mission to Kent appears to have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>But in God's timing there was now to be a new Celtic mission to England, coming from Iona to Lindisfarne, the island off the North East coast, just south of Berwick upon Tweed. How did it happen? Well, only a year or two after Edwin's death, a Christian named Oswald gained power as the Northumbrian king. He immediately invited not a person from Paulinus' Roman connection, but from Celtic Iona to re-evangelize the north. After a short visit by someone unsuitable, Aidan came as a missionary bishop, and in 635 he founded the monastery on Lindisfarne. This island, now "Holy Island", then became the 7th century centre for Christianity in England. Aidan and other church planters went out from Lindisfarne not only evangelizing Northumbria but many other parts of the country; and this resulted in a significant advance of the Christian faith. So the Celtic mission took over where the Roman mission had failed and converts now stood firm. Nor was Lindisfarne only an evangelistic centre. It also became a centre for education and scholarship, with the world-famous Lindisfarne Gospels being completed at the monastery around the year 700.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons for Today</strong></p>
<p>The strength of the Celtic mission certainly has lessons for us today. Not least is the fact that it was centred on monasteries (or minster churches) under abbots (with bishops assisting). Evangelistic teams were then going out from the monasteries which were not regulated or restricted by diocesan structures. This was so different to the Roman pattern of working. As John Finney puts it:</p>
<blockquote><div>The Roman pattern was to set up a skeleton organisation and then evangelise. The Celtic pattern was to gather the people and then set up an appropriate framework for them.</div></blockquote>
<p>But the Celtic mission was not without challenge. It seems the Pope, or those of the Roman connection in the south, had worries over a lack of practical conformity and organization (with the presenting problems being the date for Easter and the tonsure of monks). According to the early 8th century Tyneside historian, Bede (672/673-735), himself a Northumbrian and pro-Roman monk, matters came to a head at the Synod of Whitby in 664. And at this synod the Roman tradition won the day. Things then changed but only gradually. For with society so unstable and people too often on the move as they were displaced through invasion or war, there was something to be said for the Celtic method and for the comment that "the Celts looked after people while the Romans looked after geographical areas". Be that as it may, the fact is that after Whitby, the Roman diocesan and parish system was now on its way but not fully established. However, in the 21st century, once again the Celtic missionary methods are being seen to be of value as distinct from established parish models. For following the Act of Toleration 1689 allowing freedom for free churchmen to meet; with Roman Catholic emancipation in 1829; with the advent of modern urbanization; with phones and cars; and especially when, after 1960, the Church of England became seriously divided doctrinally and has declined numerically, the parish system has raised many questions.</p>
<p>So that is why in England many are now arguing the time has come to try again, alongside the parish system, a Celtic model of church order and evangelism – the minster model with missionary bishops. Churches like Holy Trinity, Brompton, in London, most famously, but other churches, including Jesmond Parish Church, are beginning to operate as "minster model" churches. True, in England the parish system cannot be abandoned in terms of duties (for example, for weddings and funerals). But a parish has lost its rights to a monopoly once churches of other denominations are in its parish and when many laypeople in its parish choose to attend another parish church, a church of another denomination or no church at all. Currently official Church of England figures for 2015 show us that the national average is for 1.5% of the population to go to church each week. That means 98.5% of people in England are not attending the Church of England on a Sunday. It is, therefore, truly sad when some clergy claim "no-go" areas in their parish to prevent others evangelizing those 98.5% when they are only able to attract to church 1.5%!</p>
<p><strong>Missionary Bishops</strong></p>
<p>A new model of Celtic mission, however, needs missionary bishops to help with visitorial and governance issues in the new churches planted. Also, and most importantly, such bishops are needed to help steer the church plants in a faithful, apostolic and biblical direction. A value of establishing the historic episcopate with regard to new church planting is to remind people that it is not only a small church in the North East of England (or wherever) but also part of the universal, or catholic, Church of God that has existed ever since the Resurrection and Day of Pentecost. And for Anglican churches and bishops that direction has to be determined by the words of Canon A5 …</p>
<blockquote><div>the doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.</div></blockquote>
<p>And current implications of that are spelt out in the REFORM covenant (an orthodox Anglican statement of belief and behavior). So the Church of England is based on the Bible. The tragedy is that we are going through a period when too many clergy, including bishops, are ignoring the Bible – hence another reason for the value of new Celtic evangelism. So we need to pray that God in his grace, and for the re-conversion of England, will raise up men for a genuinely apostolic and missionary episcopal ministry. This will result in what is a "mixed economy" Church about which a former Archbishop of Canterbury spoke, Rowan Williams (many will agree with him on this while disagreeing on other matters):</p>
<blockquote><div>Church is what happens when the call of Jesus is definitively heard. God calls. God makes a difference. God draws together a community of people. We hold to Scripture and sacraments as the essential common language God has given. But what then? Then, I suspect, it's a lot more chaotic than we have usually assumed. In Wales, we used to talk about the 'mixed economy' Church - that is, one which is learning how to cope with diverse forms and rhythms of worshipping life. The parish system works very well in some contexts. It's just that we are increasingly aware of the contexts where it simply isn't capable of making an impact, where something has to grow out of it or alongside it, not as a rival (why do we cast so much of our Christian life in terms of competition?) but as an attempt to answer questions that the parish system was never meant to answer… Mission, it's been said, is finding out what God is doing and joining in. And at present there is actually an extraordinary amount going on in terms of the creation of new styles of church life. We can call it church planting, 'new ways of being church' or various other things; but the point is that more and more patterns of worship and shared life are appearing on the edge of our mainstream life that cry out for our support, understanding and nurture if they are not to get isolated and unaccountable"(Archbishop Rowan Williams, Presidential Address at General Synod, York, 14 July 2003).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="New Style Orthodox Bishops">(May 2017) New Style Orthodox Bishops</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>What is proposed?</strong></p>
<p>I read two significant articles in April 2017. The first was in <em>The Mail on Sunday</em>. It came from its paper's Religion Correspondent, Jonathan Petre. The headline was, <em>African threat to 'plant' bishop in UK to defy Welby on gay Christians</em>. It said the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>Conservative Anglican archbishops from Africa and Asia are plotting to create a new 'missionary' bishop to lead traditionalists in the UK – after warning that the Church of England is becoming too liberal on homosexuality … Archbishop Welby alarmed conservatives in February by issuing a letter softening his stance on homosexuality. In the letter, written with his counterpart in York, John Sentamu, he called for a 'radical new inclusion' for gays and a '21st Century understanding' of sexuality - apparently paving the way for the first formal services to celebrate gay couples.The Archbishop of Nigeria, Nicholas Okoh, who chairs the Global Anglican Futures Conference (GAFCON) group of conservative archbishops, said the 'distressing' letter had 'downgraded the historic and biblical mind of the Church'. Even more alarming for GAFCON leaders, however, is that the liberal Scottish Episcopal Church is expected to become the first Anglican body in the UK to approve full-scale gay marriage at its annual synod in June.At least seven GAFCON archbishops, who represent a vast swathe of the world's Anglicans, will be at the five-day meeting starting tomorrow in Lagos, together with UK clergy. Although several options will be discussed, the most dramatic would involve African archbishops consecrating a new bishop who could then be 'parachuted' into the UK to minister to traditional parishes. Church of England leaders will see this as a highly unwelcome parallel Anglican Church set up without the permission of Archbishop Welby. It is thought the most likely candidate to become the first such bishop is Canon Andrew Lines, who runs the mission organisation Crosslinks in South London and who is already the chair of GAFCON UK.</div></blockquote>
<p>That was written on 23 April 2017. On 30 April the GAFCON Archbishops "replied" via a Communique from the Primates Council to its members and supporters as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>During our meeting, we considered how best to respond to the voice of faithful Anglicans in some parts of the Global North who are in need of biblically faithful episcopal leadership. Of immediate concern is the reality that on 8th June 2017 the Scottish Episcopal Church is likely to formalize their rejection of Jesus' teaching on marriage. If this were to happen, faithful Anglicans in Scotland will need appropriate pastoral care. In addition, within England there are churches that have, for reasons of conscience, been planted outside of the Church of England by the Anglican Mission in England (AMiE). These churches are growing, and are in need of episcopal leadership. Therefore, we have decided to consecrate a missionary bishop who will be tasked with providing episcopal leadership for those who are outside the structures of any Anglican province, especially in Europe … We believe that the complexity of the current situation in Europe does not admit of a single solution. Faithful Christians may be called to different courses of action.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is it proposed?</strong></p>
<p>The second article I read, again at the end of April, was in the journal <em>First Things</em>. It was from the current May 2017 edition and included a section on bishops. It asked the question: "Why do our bishops lead in such ecclesiastically unhealthy ways?" It then gave four reasons.</p>
<blockquote><div>First, many of them were theologically and morally formed during earlier days of British Christendom, before secular forces in the culture became dominant. During those days, the church and the culture mostly got along. If they did not, the church simply tried to catch up to the culture. The church and her leaders were seldom at odds with the culture and its leaders.Second, there are theological reasons for inept episcopal leadership. Liberal Protestantism's God, the 'God without wrath' who 'brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross' (as H. Richard Niebuhr put it) - has trouble saying 'No!' to anything except the racism, sexism, and other isms denounced by progressives. So do bishops who worship this God. As you might guess, these bishops believe this God is all - and I mean all! - about the grace of acceptance.Third, some key bishops are progressive in their moral theology, or at least they have progressive sympathies. They have clearly taken sides in the current church struggle; they do all they can to support the progressive cause; and they are all too willing to intimidate the more evangelical and orthodox bishops on the Council of Bishops.And, fourth, more than a few bishops lead in this way because of an articulated, or assumed, organizational calculation. This is what they figure: If they play the middle in this disagreement in their church, if they "reach out" to the progressives and the moderates and the traditionalists, if they try to please as many Anglicans as possible, if they create as many moral choices as possible for clergy and laity in the church, if they offend as few Anglicans as possible, if they work hard to "accommodate diversity," if they talk incessantly about the "unity" of the church (without substantive reference to doctrine, scripture, or truth), then they and their ministries will hold the Church of England together. Instead, their goal of accommodation is leading to a slow, continual erosion of the church.</div></blockquote>
<p>But that was not written about our bishops in the Church of England. It was written by Paul Stallsworth, an American United Methodist pastor and about Methodist bishops. I just changed the word American to British in the first reason, and United Methodist and United Methodist Church to Anglican and Church of England in the fourth reason. However, as the cap fits, it can be worn! Certainly seeking "good disagreement" between the moral and the immoral, the current Church of England bishops' policy, finds a place in that fourth reason. In the world, of course, we need to work at "good disagreement" as we seek to help people come to know Jesus as Lord and Saviour. But in the Church it is a very different thing. As Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 5.9-13:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people - not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler - not even to eat with such a one. For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. 'Purge the evil person from among you.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>You obviously cannot have a bishop teaching that greed, idolatry, reviling, being a drunkard or swindling requires "facilitated conversations" to lead to "good disagreement" in the Church between those not guilty and those "guilty of greed or an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler". So why should those "guilty of sexual immorality" be an exception?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>How do I respond to the GAFCON Primates? First, I thank them for proposing to consecrate one bishop as we need three such bishops. It will help orthodox Anglican church growth (with weekly only 1.5% of the population now in C of E churches). Consecrating a man such as Andy Lines, supposing the guess is right, will help meet the main need of the churches they specify - the ordaining of other men for ministry and helping with governance issues. I would, then, advise them to secure the consecration of Andy by bishops from churches like ACNA (the Anglican Church of North America) or REACH SA (the Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa). These are both good Anglican churches that have valid clerical orders but are technically not "in communion" with the Church of England. This, actually, can help Andy's identity remain in the Church of England, and not set up a "parallel Anglican Church". So it can help with reforming the Church of England, particularly if he is required to declare his commitment to Church of England Canon A5, the C of E Canon of Canons. This says: "the doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal."</p>                    <hr><h2 id="JPC Press Statement - New Style English Bishop">(May 2017) JPC Press Statement - New Style English Bishop</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p>On St Athanasius' Day, 2 May 2017, Jonathan Pryke, the senior minister, under its vicar, of Jesmond Parish Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, was consecrated a "bishop in the Church of God". This was by the Presiding Bishop of REACH SA (the Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa), formerly known as CESA (the Church of England in South Africa) and whose orders of bishop, priest/presbyter and deacon are recognized by the Church of England. But like the new ACNA (the Anglican Church in North America) whose orders are also recognized, it is not in communion with the Church of England. Officially the Church of England is in Communion with the heterodox ACSA (the Anglican Church of South Africa), and with the heterodox TEC (The Episcopal Church [of America]). But, in practice, many orthodox English and Global Anglicans are in communion with both REACH SA and ACNA.</p>
<p>The service took place neither in a Church of England "place of worship" nor an unconsecrated place of worship designated under s.43 of the Mission and Pastoral Measure 2011. It did not take place in Jesmond Parish Church. The ceremony was according to the REACH SA consecration Holy Communion service with only REACH SA bishops taking part. The declaration, however, was to the Church of England's Canon A5 which says:</p>
<blockquote><div>The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal.</div></blockquote>
<p>The oath was of "all due reverence and obedience" not to the Presiding Bishop of REACH SA but to "bishops and other chief ministers" under whom Jonathan is set. So he has a dispersed responsibility and duty: in things temporal to the Bishop of Newcastle, with whom, sadly, in things spiritual, Jesmond Parish Church along with other churches in the diocese are in impaired communion; in terms of Jesmond Parish Church, to the vicar of Jesmond and where there is united agreement, to the Jesmond PCC; and, pastorally, to one of the participating REACH SA bishops. This bishop particularly understands the English situation and does not want to see bishops "parachuted in" to form a new "orthodox church" or "province". He sees the role of REACH SA simply as helping English people have the courage to take responsibility for reforming the Church of England to be in line with Canon A5, to evangelize and to see growth. This consecration took place after considerable discussion and encouragement from leaders in the Church of England, and with the Presiding Bishop of REACH SA convinced it right to proceed after discussion with the Secretary of GAFCON.</p>
<p><strong>Information for Editors</strong></p>
<p>Why is there a need of a bishop of someone on the staff of Jesmond Parish Church? The Jesmond PCC motion of 6 March 2017 sums it up:</p>
<blockquote><div>in the light of the vicar's fourth talk at the Jesmond Conference and the REFORM Covenant that expresses 'the need radically to reform the present shape of episcopacy and pastoral discipline to enable local churches to evangelize more effectively' the PCC supports planning for Jonathan Pryke to be consecrated for an alternative form of episcopal oversight.</div></blockquote>
<p>There are excerpts from that fourth talk in the Church Newsletter for April 2017 and there is a follow-on article in the Church Newsletter out for May 2017 on Sunday 7 May 2017. These are appended below.</p>
<p>Of course, two questions need to be answered. First, is it possible to have responsibilities in a Church of England parish while at the same time having episcopal responsibilities? Yes, certainly. For one of the Panel of UK GAFCON bishops before retirement was a priest in charge of a parish in the Church of England while at the same time a bishop of the Church of Rwanda, where he spent a month or two each year. Secondly, will this new role make a great deal of difference to Jonathan's work at Jesmond? No! He will spend 80% of his time in helping Jesmond Parish Church fulfil its mission of being faithful to its founder's 19th century vision of being "a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound scriptural and evangelical truth" and its 20th/21st century vision of "Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain". And 20% of his time in helping establish new churches. This follows the model of episcopacy in REACH SA where everyone except the Presiding Bishop is in a charge of a congregation.</p>
<p>Jonathan already is a member of the AMiE executive and so committed to planting 25 new churches by 2025 (essential, under God, for evangelism and growth) and 250 new churches by 2050. The main thing that is significantly different now as far as Jonathan is concerned is that Jonathan can ordain men for the ministry, whereas other presbyter/priests of us involved in evangelism cannot. Some leaders obviously need this "power" (as the 16th century Richard Hooker would say) as more men are trained for ministry and to be faithful to Canon A5. Also they need it to help planted churches corporately keep faithful to Canon A5. At the Jesmond Conference a group of senior leaders including one REACH SA bishop and one English GAFCON Bishop, agreed that three bishops were needed, one being consecrated with REACH SA orders; one being consecrated as a result of an initiative by the GAFCON Primates; and one other.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the GAFCON Primates will secure the consecration of a man in such a way that will enable the reform of the Church of England, with him responsible to English Christians rather than a distant Primate. In this 500th anniversary year of the 16th century Reformation it needs to be remembered that the independence of the local Province was a major concern of the English Reformation as well as the primacy of the Bible and Justification by Faith.</p>

<p><strong>7th century lessons from the North East for the evangelization of Britain in the 21st century</strong></p>
<p>The following is an edited extract from my 20 minute introductory talk at the fourth session of this year's February Jesmond Conference.</p>
<p><strong>7th Century Missions</strong></p>
<p>The lessons actually have their roots in the early 5th century (AD) when the Roman legions had left Britain to defend the Empire nearer home; and, also, the lessons began in Celtic Ireland, not the North East of England, with Patrick who was born in 390 and who in 432 was a missionary bishop for Ireland. Amazingly before his death Ireland had become a Christian country. Patrick died in 461. However, his work bore more and significant fruit 100 years later. For in the 6th century, in 563, a wider Celtic missionary movement was launched from Ireland by Columba, who founded a monastery on Iona, an island off the west coast of Scotland, that then became a centre for evangelizing Scotland.</p>
<p>The next important initiative as far as Britain was concerned was in 597, 34 years later. That was when there was a new Italian, or Roman, missionary initiative. It began small with Pope Gregory (590-604) sending a team under Augustine (not to be confused with the great Augustine, Bishop of Hippo) to the south of England. He was to establish diocesan structures and with provincial archbishoprics in London and York, following the pattern of government left by the Roman legions nearly two centuries earlier. Augustine saw people converted and he established bishoprics in London and Rochester. But, sadly, in 616 in the face of a pagan resurgence the bishops of London and Rochester had to flee across the Channel. Paulinus, however, who had joined Augustine's team, went up to York in 625 and was involved in the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria. But, sadly, that mission too was short-lived. For with Edwin's death in 633, pagans gained control of Northumbria and Paulinus had to flee south. So by the early 630s, forty years after its start, the Roman mission to Kent appears to have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>But in God's timing there was now to be a new Celtic mission to England, coming from Iona to Lindisfarne, the island off the North East coast, just south of Berwick upon Tweed. How did it happen? Well, only a year or two after Edwin's death, a Christian named Oswald gained power as the Northumbrian king. He immediately invited not a person from Paulinus' Roman connection, but from Celtic Iona to re-evangelize the north. After a short visit by someone unsuitable, Aidan came as a missionary bishop, and in 635 he founded the monastery on Lindisfarne. This island, now "Holy Island", then became the 7th century centre for Christianity in England. Aidan and other church planters went out from Lindisfarne not only evangelizing Northumbria but many other parts of the country; and this resulted in a significant advance of the Christian faith. So the Celtic mission took over where the Roman mission had failed and converts now stood firm. Nor was Lindisfarne only an evangelistic centre. It also became a centre for education and scholarship, with the world-famous Lindisfarne Gospels being completed at the monastery around the year 700.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons for Today</strong></p>
<p>The strength of the Celtic mission certainly has lessons for us today. Not least is the fact that it was centred on monasteries (or minster churches) under abbots (with bishops assisting). Evangelistic teams were then going out from the monasteries which were not regulated or restricted by diocesan structures. This was so different to the Roman pattern of working. As John Finney puts it:</p>
<blockquote><div>The Roman pattern was to set up a skeleton organisation and then evangelise. The Celtic pattern was to gather the people and then set up an appropriate framework for them.</div></blockquote>
<p>But the Celtic mission was not without challenge. It seems the Pope, or those of the Roman connection in the south, had worries over a lack of practical conformity and organization (with the presenting problems being the date for Easter and the tonsure of monks). According to the early 8th century Tyneside historian, Bede (672/673-735), himself a Northumbrian and pro-Roman monk, matters came to a head at the Synod of Whitby in 664. And at this synod the Roman tradition won the day. Things then changed but only gradually. For with society so unstable and people too often on the move as they were displaced through invasion or war, there was something to be said for the Celtic method and for the comment that "the Celts looked after people while the Romans looked after geographical areas". Be that as it may, the fact is that after Whitby, the Roman diocesan and parish system was now on its way but not fully established. However, in the 21st century, once again the Celtic missionary methods are being seen to be of value as distinct from established parish models. For following the Act of Toleration 1689 allowing freedom for free churchmen to meet; with Roman Catholic emancipation in 1829; with the advent of modern urbanization; with phones and cars; and especially when, after 1960, the Church of England became seriously divided doctrinally and has declined numerically, the parish system has raised many questions.</p>
<p>So that is why in England many are now arguing the time has come to try again, alongside the parish system, a Celtic model of church order and evangelism – the minster model with missionary bishops. Churches like Holy Trinity, Brompton, in London, most famously, but other churches, including Jesmond Parish Church, are beginning to operate as "minster model" churches. True, in England the parish system cannot be abandoned in terms of duties (for example, for weddings and funerals). But a parish has lost its rights to a monopoly once churches of other denominations are in its parish and when many laypeople in its parish choose to attend another parish church, a church of another denomination or no church at all. Currently official Church of England figures for 2015 show us that the national average is for 1.5% of the population to go to church each week. That means 98.5% of people in England are not attending the Church of England on a Sunday. It is, therefore, truly sad when some clergy claim "no-go" areas in their parish to prevent others evangelizing those 98.5% when they are only able to attract to church 1.5%!</p>
<p><strong>Missionary Bishops</strong></p>
<p>A new model of Celtic mission, however, needs missionary bishops to help with visitorial and governance issues in the new churches planted. Also, and most importantly, such bishops are needed to help steer the church plants in a faithful, apostolic and biblical direction. A value of establishing the historic episcopate with regard to new church planting is to remind people that it is not only a small church in the North East of England (or wherever) but also part of the universal, or catholic, Church of God that has existed ever since the Resurrection and Day of Pentecost. And for Anglican churches and bishops that direction has to be determined by the words of Canon A5 …</p>
<blockquote><div>the doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.</div></blockquote>
<p>And current implications of that are spelt out in the REFORM covenant (an orthodox Anglican statement of belief and behavior). So the Church of England is based on the Bible. The tragedy is that we are going through a period when too many clergy, including bishops, are ignoring the Bible – hence another reason for the value of new Celtic evangelism. So we need to pray that God in his grace, and for the re-conversion of England, will raise up men for a genuinely apostolic and missionary episcopal ministry. This will result in what is a "mixed economy" Church about which a former Archbishop of Canterbury spoke, Rowan Williams (many will agree with him on this while disagreeing on other matters):</p>
<blockquote><div>Church is what happens when the call of Jesus is definitively heard. God calls. God makes a difference. God draws together a community of people. We hold to Scripture and sacraments as the essential common language God has given. But what then? Then, I suspect, it's a lot more chaotic than we have usually assumed.

And at present there is actually an extraordinary amount going on in terms of the creation of new styles of church life. We can call it church planting, 'new ways of being church' or various other things; but the point is that more and more patterns of worship and shared life are appearing on the edge of our mainstream life that cry out for our support, understanding and nurture if they are not to get isolated and unaccountable"(Archbishop Rowan Williams, Presidential Address at General Synod, York, 14 July 2003).</div></blockquote>

<p><strong>New style orthodox bishops</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is proposed?</strong></p>
<p>I read two significant articles in April 2017. The first was in <em>The Mail on Sunday</em>. It came from its paper's Religion Correspondent, Jonathan Petre. The headline was, <em>African threat to 'plant' bishop in UK to defy Welby on gay Christians</em>. It said the following:</p>

Consecrating a man such as Andy Lines, supposing the guess is right, will help meet the main need of the churches they specify - the ordaining of other men for ministry and helping with governance issues. I would, then, advise them to secure the consecration of Andy by bishops from churches like ACNA (the Anglican Church of North America) or REACH SA (the Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa). These are both good Anglican churches that have valid clerical orders but are technically not "in communion" with the Church of England. This, actually, can help Andy's identity remain in the Church of England, and not set up a "parallel Anglican Church". So it can help with reforming the Church of England, particularly if he is required to declare his commitment to Church of England Canon A5, the C of E Canon of Canons. This says: "the doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal."</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Jesmond Consecration">(June 2017) The Jesmond Consecration</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Part 1 - The following is by Dr Mark Thompson, Principal of Moore theological college, Sydney (the biggest Anglican seminary in the Anglican Communion).</strong></p>
<p>In October 1517 Martin Luther began a revolution. He had not intended to do so. His concern was that the church he loved might see the danger it was in and make a stand with him on the teaching of Scripture. It was a rather innocuous act at first sight, the posting of notice of a university debate. Yet the reaction to Luther's 95 theses and the subsequent action of this faithful Christian leader in the church and university of Wittenberg demonstrated quite clearly the determination of the institution, the entire hierarchical structure extending to the Pope in Rome, to resist reformation and to continue on its path of false teaching and unfaithful practice. They would not stand with him but opposed him with every weapon in their armoury. Before long, Luther and those around him would need to train and authorise faithful leaders for the churches in Germany and elsewhere. When the institution had failed so badly and was so demonstrably committed to directions contrary to the word of God, something needed to be done. They could no longer wait for the institutional structures to embrace reform and sit again under the word of God come what may. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p>500 years on there are places all over the world where a new reformation is sorely needed. The Church of England is a case in point. There are many faithful men and women within the Church of England who teach, believe, and live out the teaching of the Bible. There are many faithful vicars and church workers and at least one faithful theological college where men and women are trained for a biblical ministry in the Church of England. There are even a few biblically faithful, godly, evangelistically-minded bishops in the Church of England. The picture is certainly not uniformly black. Yet for decades the structures of the Church of England have proven resistant to reform in the light of the Scriptures. Unbelief and immorality are not challenged but excused and, more recently, embraced. When the faithful are attacked for seeking to live out the same quiet, biblical faith as the sovereign, they find little support from the hierarchy of the Church of England, and whatever support they do receive is heavily qualified. The leadership is powerless or unwilling to act. When the faithful have cried out for protection against the predatory liberalism within the Church of England, which masquerades as tolerance and sophisticated broad-mindedness, little or nothing is done. Quietly the stranglehold of unbelief on the structures of the Church of England gets tighter and tighter. The disdain with which evangelical churches and institutions are treated is obvious and the subtle and not so subtle attempts to pressure them into conformity have continued to increase. The nation needs to be re-evangelised and meanwhile the bishops seem entangled in endless debates about legalities and how they might baptise the cultural consensus. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p>On 2 May the Revd Jonathan Pryke, a long serving member of the ministry staff at Jesmond Parish Church, was consecrated as a bishop in the the north of England. It was an entirely valid and legal consecration, though irregular. It was not initiated or sanctioned by the hierarchy of the Church of England. The consecrators were bishops of the Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa (REACH-SA). The action was taken independently of bodies such as the AMiE (Anglican Mission in England) and GAFCON. It is regrettable that it has come to this, yet time and again every attempt to bring the Church of England back to the teaching of Scripture has been blocked by bishops, the General Synod, or the committees and organisations of the church. Those out of fellowship with their bishop over a number of doctrinal and ethical issues have had no support or encouragement from the leadership of the church. The so-called 'provision' for conscientious dissent has proven to be ineffectual in many cases, since it requires the permission of the local bishop who may well be entirely opposed. The faithful have waited and waited and now some have judged the time has come to act.</p>
<p>Bishop Pryke is a godly man who is committed to the teaching of the Scriptures. He is a conscientious Anglican who believes the classic doctrine of the church as expressed in the 39 Articles and the Book of Common Prayer. His godly character is attested by those who have observed him in ministry over many years. He is an entirely appropriate candidate for leadership among God's people. The consecration is valid, there can be no doubt about that. It is, however, irregular, but that irregularity is borne out of the desperate situation in which believers who remain within the Church of England find themselves.</p>
<p>Already there have been threats of legal action and the accusations and denunciations have begun. Of course it is permissible for evangelical Anglicans in England and elsewhere to conclude 'I would not have done it that way'. We must not copy the tactics of coercion used by others and insist on a uniformity of opinion. Nevertheless, the impasse between evangelicals (often labelled 'conservative evangelicals' in the UK) and the church hierarchy could not continue forever. Something has had to be done and now a group of faithful men and women have acted. Even if I wish there had been another way to do this, I still want to pray, encourage, and support those who have been courageous enough to act. In particular, I want to support Bishop Pryke in prayer. I will pray that he will provide the kind of leadership that has been lacking in the Church of England and that he will provide effective pastoral care for those who have felt stranded and isolated within their own church.</p>
<p>There were those in Luther's time who thought 'now is not the time' and 'we can still work within the existing structures' and 'it's not as bad as you make out'. Yet he — with all his flaws — was God's instrument in bringing lasting and beneficial change to the Christian churches. The biblical gospel was recovered and, though it was not called this at the time, a work of re-evangelising Europe was begun. We can look back from 500 years on and say 'Yes, it was the time'. My hope is that we will look back at the events of last week and give thanks to God that this was a pivotal moment in a movement that sees the gospel, and the Lord of the gospel, honoured and treasured again throughout England.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 - A comment by David Holloway - vicar of Jesmond</strong></p>
<p>What is at stake in Jonathan Pryke's consecration which has received widespread support and approval, such as expressed by Mark Thompson? So why has there been some, even libelous, opposition? It is not enough to say it was "irregular" as contrary to church regulation, for it was not: rather it was "irregular" as being unique and to which regulation did not apply and so for which it was praised by one mainstream bishop. Nor is it enough to say the opposition was because of "fake news", which there has been and caused by some dubious intentional ambiguity. Nor is it enough to say it is because of the surprise caused by necessary confidentiality. Nor is it enough to say it is because it was without the formal support (from the need for confidentiality) of both GAFCON and AMiE, since it had their informal support with members wanting it to go ahead but not wanting to say so publicly. What, then, is the issue? I believe it is very significant as relating not only to the Church but also the State and relevant for our thinking at this time of a General Election. The issue, I believe, is the loss by senior leadership in both Church and State of what social-scientists are having to call "classical authority". And Jonathan Pryke in a minor way is not only exposing this loss but seeking to model a way of rectifying it and by following the Celtic tradition appropriate to the North East of England. But critics are wrong-headedly judging Jonathan Pryke against the roles, and so requirements, of mainstream Church of England bishops which are irrelevant in this case. Therefore, such opposition is through a misjudgment.</p>
<p>Classical or traditional authority has evolved in Western society from the Greco-Roman and Christian traditions. It is where authority is based on the notion of a common unifying vision. It is, therefore, distinct from domination on the one hand and persuasion on the other - from militaristic tyrants whose authority is from enforcement through the gun, or charismatic dictators who use illiberal oratory and then manipulation – like Hitler. But in our Western liberal democratic tradition political and governing authority in both Church and State has been until recently to procure a common unifying vision, which in Europe has had a Christian foundation. However, the secular "religion of Me" with its pervasive individualism has led to the undermining of a common unifying vision. This has led to what is being called "a new authority". As the academic theologian Philip Turner says, "the new authority rests not upon the presence of shared beliefs and practices but upon their absence. Within modern and postmodern cultures, this new way of having authority … functions not to further what is common but to ensure a social order within which people who regard one another as strangers and potential enemies, can follow differing beliefs and ways of life without in the process doing unacceptable harm one to another." All of that is inevitable (and dangerous) in a secular State that is rejecting much of its Christian heritage, but not inevitable in the Church. But many Church of England bishops have now accepted this new authority under the guise of "good disagreement" over sexual ethics. However, like the sale of indulgences for Luther, this is both symptomatic and a fundamental doctrinal matter which according to the established law of the land could be judged heretical, cf. Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974 (5.1), Paul (1 Cor 5.9-13) and the letter of the risen Christ To the Church in Thyatira (Rev 2.18-26).</p>
<p>So please pray that Jonathan Pryke's consecration, with his assent to the wording of the Church of England's biblical Canon A5, is, indeed, part of a new reformation for the good of Church and Society and, above all, for God's glory.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Graduation Address at Namirembe Cathedral, Kampala, Uganda">(August 2017) Graduation Address at Namirembe Cathedral, Kampala, Uganda</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2017</li><li>The Worldwide Church</li></ul>
                                                <p>The following is the address given at the commissioning service held on 3rd June 2017 in Namirembe Cathedral, Kampala, Uganda during the Graduation Weekend for the first 49 South Sudanese students completing the National Institute of Health Sciences (Jonglei province) training programme. This is for training Midwives, Clinical Officers and Registered Nurses to work in South Sudan, which has one of the worst health records in the world. This Christian run training programme has the support (but not financial) and encouragement of the South Sudan Government. Anglican International Development (AID) has helped fund it; and its medical faculty has been working on behalf of the International Christian Medical and Dental Association (ICMDA). Because of fighting tragically breaking out in the South Sudan, the National Institute could not be established in Bor (the capital of Jonglei) in 2014. However, the Mengo Hospital, a great Christian hospital in Kampala, Uganda - was willing to provide space for the programme. The commissioning of the students was led by the Archbishop of Uganda, with the service including a version of the "Hippocratic" Oath from the US Christian Medical Fellowship. Also at the service were interested representatives of the wider community. Please pray on for the continuation of this programme and its financing.</p>
<p>As chairman of Anglican International Development (AID), can I say how honoured I am to be able to be with you all on this remarkable occasion. And straightaway I need to say a big thank you, on behalf of all us visitors, above all to God for his goodness, and then to our friends working on behalf of the International Christian Medical and Dental Association (ICMDA). So a huge thank you to Anil and Shalini Cherian and the Staff at the National Institute of Health Sciences Jonglei for their leading and teaching that has made this service possible and necessary! And a great thank you too, to Dr Rose Mutumba, and her hospital authorities for allowing Mengo to host the Institute these past three years. And last not least we thank his Grace, the Archbishop, and the Dean of this cathedral, for enabling us all to be here this evening.</p>
<p>I first entered this building in 1965 - 52 years ago, as a CMS missionary working in the Sudan, when visiting Uganda with some South Sudanese students for a Christian conference. Much has changed since then, but not Jesus Christ. As Hebrews 13.8 says: <em>"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."</em></p>
<p>And that is why in 2017 we still need to study Jesus' word and that of his Apostles, which of course means studying the Bible. So what does the Bible say to students that are soon to leave and seek work as Midwives, Clinical Officers and Registered Nurses, in today's world with all its problems, challenges and opportunities? I want to be simple and suggest four things it teaches you to do.</p>
<p>They are in the form of four couplets, first, Seek First; secondly, Finish Strong; thirdly, Keep Christian; and, fourthly, Watch Yourself. So...</p>
<p><strong>1. Seek First</strong></p>
<p>What does that mean? Well, it is from the promise of Jesus in his Sermon on the Mount, where he says: <em>"Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these things </em>[basic human needs that we so often worry about]<em> will be added to you"</em> (Matt 6.33).</p>
<p>A number of you are soon to start a new phase in your lives. So how are you thinking about what you will be doing not only as Midwives, Clinical Officers and Registered Nurses but as Christian Midwives, Clinical Officers and Registered Nurses? What do you expect to happen when you are out in your clinic, health centre or hospital?</p>
<p>The first thing to say is that if you go where God is calling you to go, and you seek first his kingdom, you will find life truly fulfilling in all sorts of ways. But don't get me wrong. The Bible doesn't promise that life will be always easy. And God's supply is not always in the way you think or want. Certainly that has been true of my life.</p>
<p>The place where I was called to work after first leaving college was Omdurman, in the Sudan. Working with the Church Missionary Society (seconded to the Presbyterian American Mission), I flew out in October 1964. But our Comet Jet plane had to overfly Khartoum as the airport was shut. A revolution was going on and General Abboud (then the President) was being overthrown. After staying in Aden, on my eventual arrival in Khartoum, I was met and driven through tear gas and rioting to Omdurman. While there, the Christian school where I was teaching was destroyed by older boys invading the school in their hundreds to attack our fine Northern Sudanese Christian headmaster. Also, with literally hundreds of thousands on the streets our huge mission centre in the middle of Khartoum with so many facilities was also utterly destroyed during one night of fighting and carnage.</p>
<p>But apart from the bad times, I learnt so much during my time in Omdurman and Khartoum. I learnt the truth of the Psalmist when he says: <em>"Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart"</em> (Psalm 37.4).</p>
<p>There was suffering and great danger but also times of lasting happiness as well. Yes, the gospel is the Good News of Jesus. But as Paul and Barnabas taught their new converts <em>"through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God"</em> (Acts 14.22). So if you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, you can trust that God will somehow supply your needs. It will not, however, always be an easy ride. There will be tribulations and testings. But God will always be in control.&nbsp;Then, secondly, you need to...</p>
<p><strong>2. Finish Strong</strong></p>
<p>I know of someone, a clergyman, who has this as his staff motto: "start well, get better, finish strong." We heard in our New Testament reading how Paul finished strong – verses 6-7 of 2 Timothy say this: <em>"… the time for my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished race, I have kept the faith."</em></p>
<p>Paul wrote that not long before he died, and from prison. So because life can be hard for the Christian – for the devil will be attacking in all sorts of ways – you need to persevere and not give up at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>Jesus is a wonderful example of not giving up once he had started on his "ministerial career", if I may call it that. For Jesus lived in hard times. Palestine was under Roman control. People felt and were oppressed. Jesus' second cousin John, John the Baptist, was in prison. He had been preaching, baptising and preparing for Jesus' ministry. He was a fearless man of God. That meant he was willing to denounce King Herod and his "wife" Herodias for their sexual immorality. Herod, then, had him arrested and imprisoned; and before long Herodias had him executed, ISIS style, by being beheaded.</p>
<p>But was Jesus depressed? Did he give up? No! Mark 1.14-15 says: <em>"After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 'The time has come,' he said. 'The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news.'"</em></p>
<p>Jesus didn't flee from Herod. Rather, he went into his territory. For Herod (Herod Antipas) had jurisdiction over Galilee. And that is just where Jesus fearlessly goes to work to start his ministry. From God's perspective this was not a bad time and place but a good time and place for Christ to begin his ministry on earth. It was the right time for God the Son, incarnate, to live, teach and die and rise again.</p>
<p>And the nub of what Jesus was teaching was that God – the God of the Bible – is the ultimate King. The ultimate authority is not Herod's or Tiberius Caesar's – nor Salva Kiir's or Riek Machar's or Mrs May's or Donald Trump's. The ultimate authority is Christ's. He has <em>"all authority in heaven and earth"</em> as after his Resurrection he told his disciples. And that was, and is still today, the good news.</p>
<p>So people need to repent and admit they need Christ's kingship over their lives. For he provides a way out of the mess human beings are in. Through his Cross sins can be forgiven and through the power of his Holy Spirit new life – spiritual life – can be received. Who needs to admit the truth of that message this evening and then trust and obey Christ? For with him you will be able to persevere and finish strong as you seek first God's kingdom in your life and work.&nbsp;Then thirdly...</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep Christian</strong></p>
<p>The medical profession today worldwide is a product of the Christian faith. Of course, it is built upon streams from other traditions and faiths. But from the word "go" Christians took seriously Jesus' command to <em>"heal the sick"</em>. And uniquely the early Christians were known for their respect for the sanctity of life from conception, since human beings are all made in God's image – with the incarnation and humanity of Jesus beginning with his conception not with Christmas Day. From the earliest days of the Church, therefore, they were known for being opposed to abortion and infanticide.</p>
<p>Also they were marked by their compassion. Let me read you something from a letter, written a little later in 361, by the Roman Emperor, Julian the Apostate, a bitter opponent of Christianity. In it he had the honesty to write this:</p>
<blockquote><div>Now we can see what it is that makes these Christians such powerful enemies of our gods. It is the brotherly love which they manifest towards the sick and poor.</div></blockquote>
<p>It is simply a fact that Christianity introduced a new note of compassion for the sick. So, soon Christian hospitals sprang up. Before the European Reformation Christian monasteries did much work for the sick. But after the Reformation sizeable hospitals sprang up as Christian foundations in Europe. Also Christians were in the forefront of the new learning and in the forefront of the new 16th and 17th century practices in medicine and surgery. The surgeon Ambroise Paré famously said of a patient: "I dressed him but God cured him" – that is, "I used my skills but God then used my skills to heal."</p>
<p>One of the great doctors of this generation of four centuries ago was Thomas Sydenham, who became known as the English Hippocrates – Hippocrates being an Ancient Greek physician. He gave this advice to students entering the medical profession – and, of course, entering at any level:</p>
<blockquote><div>Whoever takes up Medicine should seriously consider, <em>[first]</em> that he must one day render to the Supreme Judge an account of the lives of those sick men <em>[and women]</em> who have been entrusted to his care. Secondly, that such skill and science as, by the blessing of Almighty God, he has attained, are to be specially directed towards the honour of his Maker <em>[God]</em> and the welfare of his fellow creatures; since it is a base thing for the great gifts of heaven to become the servants of avarice and ambition <em>[that is to say, selfishly used to make money and to become famous]</em>. Thirdly, he must remember that it is no mean or ignoble animal that he deals with. We may ascertain the worth of the human race, since for its sake God's only begotten Son became man, and thereby ennobled the nature that he took upon him.</div></blockquote>
<p>So "keep Christian" – in your medical ethics and attitudes to patients. There are many other voices trying to shape modern medicine, but in godless and harmful ways. Learn to say, "No!", therefore, to those voices for the good of your patients. So, Seek First, Finish Strong, Keep Christian and then, fourthly...</p>
<p><strong>4. Watch Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Mark tells us that Jesus spent much of his time at the start of his ministry healing the sick and those oppressed by demons. And it seemed a revival soon had broken out. We read in Mark 1.33 that <em>"the whole city was gathered together"</em> to experience Jesus' ministry and hear his teaching. But what do we then read, that Jesus called for more gatherings? No! But that, verse 35: <em>"rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed, and there prayed."</em></p>
<p>Jesus knew that there was a spiritual war on and prayer was essential. For prayer is the great weapon in this war against the evil one. It is also waged with <em>"the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God"</em> – as Paul tells you in Ephesians 6.17. And it is so essential in your personal life, if you are medical, to have time to pray and read God's word regularly, on your own and together in small Bible study groups and to hear it expounded in Church on a Sunday.</p>
<p>For life will be hard. The devil will attack you. And if you are medical and faithful to your patients, you often will be very busy. But Jesus was so busy that he realized he needed to pray. For prayer is the way the devil is defeated and priorities are established. So Paul said to Timothy in his first letter: <em>"keep a close watch on yourself"</em> (1 Tim 4.16) – on your spiritual self. If Bible study and prayer are ways to keep spiritually alert to the devil's activity and temptation, he will tempt you not to read the Bible and not to pray. So watch yourself and check you are not drifting spiritually.</p>
<p><strong>I must conclude.</strong></p>
<p>I do so by simply encouraging you, with God's help, to seek first [his kingdom]; finish strong [persevere when the going is hard]; keep Christian [when the acids of secularism or other religions are destroying our wonderful medical tradition]; and keep watch on yourself [for you so need prayer for the Holy Spirit to strengthen you when the going is hard and for God's word to guide you when the world is confusing]. Amen.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The 16th Century Reformation of Religion (Part I - The Background)">(September 2017) The 16th Century Reformation of Religion (Part I - The Background)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p>Next month, on 31 October 2017, we celebrate 500 years of Luther's 95 Theses that formed his "Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences". This was allegedly affixed to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. It certainly was seismic, although it would not have seemed so at the time. Luther, a German monk and university teacher, was simply questioning some relics of medieval Catholic dogma that were being manipulated by the current Pope for financial gain. However, a spark was being lit that turned into a mighty spiritual and political fire. So what were the real problems? You can cite various factors, but as well as Christian theology, also involved were politics, money, power and sex.</p>
<p><strong>Church and State Too Identified</strong></p>
<p>Politically the Church was too identified with the State through the power and position of the Pope (the bishop of Rome). There are always problems regarding how far the Church as such should be involved in the State. Christians are to be salt and light in society (Matt 5.13-14). If they are totally withdrawn from public life and remain in their own little ghettos, obviously they can neither preserve (as salt) or enlighten (as light) the wider world and the State. But if the Church is totally identified with the State, one of whose tasks is the restraining of human sin, Christians can lose their savour and their shine. Yes, Jesus had taught that we are to <em>"render to Caesar </em>[the State]<em> the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's"</em> (Mark 12.17). Then Paul taught that the political authorities, in his case the Roman Emperor (a pagan), had divine authority, amazingly from Christ (Rom 13.1; Matt 28.18; 1 Cor 15.24-25). But when the State commands what God forbids, or forbids what God commands, you must obey God rather than the State according to Peter (Acts 5.29). And John in the book of Revelation (Rev 13.1-10) made it clear that sometimes the State can be quite demonic. Then Peter's teaching has to be put into practice and, as he was to learn himself, at the cost even of your life. That teaching on Church and State in those earliest of times was relatively clear and simple, although for some terrifying. But when in the 4th century the emperor Constantine endorsed, as a Christian, the Christian faith, Christians were often asked (and have been since) to exercise power and advise on policy; and things became more complicated.</p>
<p>So what followed the 4th century onwards has been a series of "ups and downs" between the Church and the State both in and beyond Europe. It has been likened to a "less-than-ideal-marriage". You can say the first three centuries were like "going out". Then from the "conversion" of Constantine to the end of the 8th century, you have the engagement period. The next and complicated period of actual marriage began on Christmas Day AD 800 when the Pope "crowned" Charlemagne as emperor, in fact, of Europe. But eventually a great crisis came with the ending of the 15th century. For in the 16th century you have the Reformation of Religion when real explosions occurred in the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Money and Power</strong></p>
<p>The papacy was a, if not the, great problem. Popes were often political figures with vast power and men who could amass fortunes. Sometimes they had questionable morals. Erasmus, who stayed a loyal Roman Catholic and opposed Luther, responded to this papal problem by writing a savage epitaph for Pope Julius II (1503-13), entitled "Julius Exclusus". This was a dialogue in which the deceased Pope is pictured approaching heaven. It then goes like this:</p>
<blockquote><div>Julius: What the devil is up? The gates not open? Some one has monkeyed with the lock.Spirit: Maybe you have the wrong key. You've got the key of power.Julius: It's the only one I ever had …Peter: Who are you?Julius: Can't you see the key, the triple crown, and the pallium sparkling with gems?Peter: It doesn't look like the key Christ gave me. How should I know the crown which no barbarian tyrant dared to wear? As for the gems and the jewels, I trample them under my feet …. Tell me again, what have you done for the Church?Julius: I found the Church poor. I made her splendid with regal palaces, splendid horses and mules, troops of servants, armies, and officers.Spirit: And glamorous prostitutes and obsequious pimps.Peter: But how now? The Church was not like this when founded by Christ … Paul did not speak of the cities he had stormed, the princes he had slaughtered, the kings he had incited to war. He spoke of shipwrecks, chains, dangers plots. These are the glories of the Christian General. I beseech you, the chief pastor of the Church, have you never thought how the Church began, increased and was established? Was it by wars, was it by wealth, was it by horses? No indeed. It was by patience, the blood of the martyrs including mine, by prisons and by stripes. You say the Church is increased when the priests have thrown the world into tumult. You consider it flourishing when drunk with debauchery, tranquil when enjoying vices without reproof, and when the grand robberies and furious conflicts are justified by the princes and doctors as the 'defence of the Church.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Money and Sex</strong></p>
<p>Julius was then followed by Leo X (1513-21), the Pope at the time of Luther's posting of his 95 Theses. Mark Noll, the church historian, says this about him:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>[He]</em> was more pious than his predecessors but no less convinced that the measure of papal greatness was an increase in papal lands and a sponsorship of the arts. Leo, who had become a cardinal while still in his teens and who rose to power via his family connections as a Medici, was a great patron of theatre, arts, and music, as well as a great hunter, a great promoter of his many Medici relatives, and a great spender of money. In fact, Leo's profligacy as patron and builder, which kept him perpetually strapped for cash, lay behind his authorization of the sale of indulgences in Germany against which Luther's Ninety-Five Theses was such a forceful protest.</div></blockquote>
<p>So there was corruption at the top of the Church in the corridors of Roman power and in Germany. But what was it like generally in Britain? This is how one contemporary, Thomas Becon, described the situation in 16th century England. Writing in mid-century (1547) it was quite shocking. For Becon reported:</p>
<blockquote><div>Although there want not, good Christian people, great swarms of vices worthy to be rebuked (unto such decay is true godliness and virtuous living now come), yet, above other vices, the outrageous sea of adultery (or breaking of wedlock), whoredom, fornication and uncleanness have not only burst in, but also overflowed almost the whole world, unto the great dishonour of God, the exceeding infamy of the name of Christ, the notable decay of true religion and the utter destruction of the public wealth; and that so abundantly that, through the customable use thereof, this vice is grown to such an height, that in a manner among many it is counted no sin at all, but rather a pastime, a dalliance and but a touch of youth, not rebuked but winked at, not punished but laughed at.</div></blockquote>
<p>As well, therefore, as corruption at the top, among the general population there was also corruption. But change was on its way across Europe. In England Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the leader of the Reform movement. And we can still learn from him today as we face our problems in the Church and the State. Of course, Luther, Cranmer and the other reformers with their essential correctives, were not all right while Rome all wrong. But reading the Homilies that Cranmer edited is still a very valuable exercise. These are referred to in Article 35 of the Church of England's Thirty-nine Articles. There the Homilies are described as containing "a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and necessary for these times". As well as being spiritually helpful, they are also a good introduction to the Reformation issues themselves. They are simple but profound. Uniquely for a Reformation Church, the Church of England had among its foundation documents these sermons (for such they are, and by different people). They were in place of a lengthy and systematic Confessional statement. So the Church of England has the Bible first but then those Thirty-nine Articles (which were 39 separate points of doctrine that needed to be highlighted), its classic Book of Common Prayer and the Homilies (or sermons) at its foundation, and as its foundation.</p>
<p>So in Part II of this look at the Reformation, I shall try to outline those Homilies by Cranmer himself which give you as good a statement of Reformation fundamentals as any. He wrote four of the first six homilies. They were on 1) Scripture, 3) Salvation (Justification by faith), 4) Faith, and 5) Faith and good works (homily 2 was on "Sin and the Fall" by John Harpsfield and 6 was on "Love" by Edmund Bonner. That excerpt on adultery was a quote from homily number 11).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Anglican Opportunities and Challenges">(October 2017) Anglican Opportunities and Challenges</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2017</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Jesmond Parish Church and the Church of England</strong></p>
<p>The mission statement of Jesmond Parish Church is Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain. That is because we take seriously the teaching and commands of Jesus. First, comes Matthew 22.37:<em> "you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."</em> That is the secret of 'Godly Living' which involves obeying the Word (for us 'God's Word written', the Bible) and trusting in Christ. Secondly, there is Matthew 28.19: <em>"go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</em> That is how we can contribute to 'Church Growth' which involves telling the world and serving the Church. And, thirdly, of course, is Matthew 22.39: <em>"you shall love your neighbour as yourself"</em>. That means we need to be practically involved in the wider world and that at least involves caring for needs and contending for truth. So that mission statement identifies us. But if that is who we are, what can I say about "Anglican Opportunities and Challenges" for us? That was the title given me on which to speak for a few minutes during our "Facing the Future" meeting in early September. What follows includes part of what I said then.</p>
<p>The Church of England is in somewhat of a sad state. But it still has great opportunities. For one thing, its fundamental doctrine is excellent. According to the law of the land, that doctrine is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.</div></blockquote>
<p>That is Canon A5, a brilliant expression of the English Reformed Christian tradition. But how is that of value to Jesmond Parish Church? It is because of our own founders. They required JPC to be "a central point for the maintenance and promulgation of sound, scriptural and evangelical truth" and in the Church of England. But think about those words.</p>
<p>We have to be concerned with the "truth" (for there is truth). But what truth? Answer: "evangelical truth" (the truth about the gospel [the 'evangel'] which is about Jesus). But which Jesus? One from a sentimental imagination? No! For it is to be "scriptural and evangelical truth" (that means only the Jesus of the Bible). But, you say, the Bible can be interpreted in so many ways. Yes! That is why it is to be "sound scriptural and evangelical truth". And that is where the Church of England's Thirty-Nine Articles are so helpful for defining a "sound" reading of the Bible. In Article XX it says clearly and simply, you may not "so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another." It is that basic principle that gives you "sound Scriptural and Evangelical truth". But, then, regarding that truth, our Founders required two things and both are essential.</p>
<p>One, we are to "maintain it" and not let it be corrupted or eroded. But we are not then just to pride ourselves on a dead orthodoxy. For we are, two, to "promulgate" it – share this truth with others and evangelize. But we are, then, not to be so taken up with evangelism that we fail to maintain the truth when it is being eroded, so that eventually there is little left to share. And that sadly is the case with many folk in the Church of England today. It is that that presents us with challenges – but not just us.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>In September someone gave me a somewhat acerbic newspaper article. It was following the survey that found now only 15% say they follow the Church of England (whatever that means) - for only 1.4% of the English population are in a Church of England on a Sunday. The writer complained about the centrist bishops who want to include everything and everyone however good or bad. He said, "Unfortunately today's bishops are too wet to be stirred into action." And quoting Mrs. Thatcher: "If you stand in the middle of the road, you will be run down from both directions." However, he ended positively:</p>
<blockquote><div>I believe the Church of England will survive and prosper. It will do so from two ends of the spectrum – its evangelical and its traditional wings, which both offer a clear view. The one part of Anglicanism doomed to failure, alas, is the Centrist element.</div></blockquote>
<p>Certainly things have been very wrong this summer. A particular rot seemed to set in on 8th June when the Scottish Episcopal Church voted in favour of changing its canons to allow same-sex marriages. Then from the 7th-10th July was the General Synod of the Church of England. Here are the notes of one General Synod member, a gifted lay woman, who was present in York for the meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start about 20 members 'protest' the presence of the visiting Bishop of Edinburgh in the light of the gay-marriage vote. Bishop of Tampere (Finland) also visiting uses his ecumenical greetings to describe how his church is moving forward on same-sex relationships.</li>
<li>Synod votes against an amendment that sought to define the 'common good' as that which is 'revealed in the Bible and taught by the Church.'</li>
<li>Synod votes against an amendment urging bishops, clergy and lay people to take every opportunity to commend to all the people of England faith in Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>Synod votes against an amendment which highlighted a report on the 'uniqueness of Christ' in the context of multi-faith relationships.</li>
<li>Synod told by the Bishop of Newcastle, Chair of the Pastoral Advisory Group, that Diocesan LGBTI Liaison officers and involvement in Pride marches "do not exhaust the ways that dioceses can offer a welcome."</li>
<li>Synod votes against an amendment to the "conversion therapy [i.e. helping people deal with unwanted same-sex attraction]" motion – an amendment which affirmed that, "pastoral care, prayer, and professional counselling are legitimate means of supporting people". It votes in favour of calling on the government to ban conversion therapy!</li>
</ul>
<p>That is just from one week and I could add more from the Synod such as a motion calling on the bishops to consider "nationally commended <em>[transgender]</em> liturgical materials" and, then, how over the summer there were Cathedrals and Bishops involved in Gay Pride celebrations, while some Cathedrals were celebrating the tercentenary of Freemasonry. But regarding the latter, the Church of England 1987 report entitled Freemasonry and Christianity "points to a number of very fundamental reasons to question the compatibility of Freemasonry and Christianity." But how do you respond to all these challenges?</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have to "maintain" the truth in the face of so many "strange and erroneous doctrines" going around. But how we need to "promulgate" (or promote) the truth as we can. So we need to see more Churches planted and this Church growing. Nor do we want Schism – hence the reason for the method and manner of Jonathan Pryke's consecration as a bishop earlier in the year. Our vision is not to leave the Church of England but to see change and reform, in line with Canon A5 and so the Reform Covenant and the Jerusalem Statement and Declaration and the majority of people in the world-wide Anglican Communion. And I am particularly concerned for the faithful poor in the Anglican Communion as Chairman of AID (Anglican International Development). So we are in fellowship with the Evangelical Archbishops and their Provinces rather than bishops who with their cathedrals and clergy promote and join in celebrations of forbidden sex. So please pray for Jonathan Pryke and I being invited to the third GAFCON in Jerusalem next June and please pray for AID which is to help that constituency - AID which is at a transition point but with all sorts of possibilities and opportunities for the future.</p>
<p>But we must be encouraged by the great opportunities we have here in Jesmond and not least through television, for which we thank God. Clayton TV, our Christian Internet Television Channel (featuring evangelical Bible talks, sermons, conferences, training courses, music and a section for kids), last year had a 1 year goal of 20% growth in viewing figures. But, quite miraculously, we had almost 300% growth this year, from 370,000 video plays to 1.08 million! This summer alone because of Keswick we had 1/3 million video plays in just 3 weeks. We are now also linked with a nationwide TV channel in Kenya, Pillar TV of the diocese of Kirinyaga, a diocese we have long been partnering. They are about to broadcast content filmed here in Jesmond. And a similar request has just come in. So please pray for Zoe Earnshaw and the TV team.</p>
<p>But thank God, as Ian Garrett reminded us as we were "Facing the Future", for a "unique opportunity that the Lord brings us every year". What is that? Answer: "a new mission field of roughly 15,000 new students and visiting scholars." So please pray for Matt Elder as he takes over as our Student Co-ordinator and Ben Cadoux Hudson our Internationals Co-ordinator. And may we all, whoever we are and as we can, be praying and working for Godly Living, Church Growth and Changing Britain (or whatever is your home country).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Luther">(December 2017) Luther</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2017</li><li>Church History and Future</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Reflections on Luther</strong></p>
<p>We are coming to the end of this 500th centenary year of Luther's action in 1517 in Wittenberg marking the formal start of the 16th century Reformation. But how, in a few words, can Luther's fundamental contribution be summarized? Carl Truman, the Lutheran Scholar, writes fairly enough:</p>
<blockquote><div>Luther has been a polarizing figure from the moment he nailed the Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church. For many ordinary people in his own day, he was a hero, a figure of near mythical proportions … For his Catholic contemporaries he was at best an arrogant upstart, at worst a sex-crazed lecher.</div></blockquote>
<p>That vicious charge of being "sex crazed" was because Luther taught that current Church practice of forbidding clergy to marry was wrong. However, there was also some crudeness in Luther's writings. And Truman along with many others know of the weaknesses of Luther (how his attitude, for example, towards the Jews was not right and so useful centuries later for evil Nazi propaganda). Nevertheless, they would say that the world owes an amazing debt to Martin Luther. And that was at least for his being a catalyst for what became a continent-wide rediscovery of the Bible and of the doctrine of "justification by faith".</p>
<p><strong>The Bible</strong></p>
<p>For Luther the Bible became supremely important. Yes, he had a place for Church tradition, but that tradition had to be subordinate to Scripture. For Luther the Bible was Queen:</p>
<blockquote><div>this Queen must rule and everyone must obey, and be subject to her. The pope, Luther, Augustine, Paul, an angel from heaven – these should not be masters, judges, or arbiters but only witnesses, disciples, and confessors of Scripture.</div></blockquote>
<p>So Luther wanted the German people to have a Bible in their own language. Accordingly, in a relatively short space of time he translated into German Erasmus' new Greek New Testament and saw it published in 1522. The translation of the Old Testament (a team effort) he saw published in 1534. All this had a seminal effect on shaping German language, but more importantly on shaping German people's faith. And Luther taught them to read the Bible like any other book, taking the common-sense meaning of the words and not looking for hidden and allegorical meanings as so many had been doing. Luther said there is only one meaning of the text which was not to be read into the text:</p>
<blockquote><div>The Holy Spirit is the simplest writer and adviser in heaven and on earth. That is why his words could have no more than the one simplest meaning which we call the written one, or the literal meaning of the tongue.</div></blockquote>
<p>We are, therefore, to "pay attention to the expression of Holy Scripture and abide by the words of the Holy Spirit." When there are difficulties in understanding a passage of the Bible you are to let other passages throw light on what is hard to understand. So Luther's commentary on Genesis contains references to other books of the Bible. With regard to creation itself, the New Testament, indeed, supports the Genesis' claim that God created the world and it was no accident.&nbsp;John's Gospel, for example, often read in Carol Services, says (John 1.1-3):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And <em>"the Word"</em> is the second person of the divine Trinity, God the Son, Jesus Christ. Similarly, Hebrews 11.3 says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible." </em></div></blockquote>
<p>Luther said:</p>
<blockquote><div>Scripture, therefore, is its own light. It is a grand thing when Scripture interprets itself.</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course, for Luther the supreme authority of the Bible came about because it is the book about Jesus Christ and contains the gospel for those …</p>
<blockquote><div>… preaching about Christ, Son of God and of David, true God and man, who by his death and resurrection has overcome for us the sin, death, and hell of all men who believe in him. Thus the gospel can be either a brief or a lengthy message; one person can write of it briefly, another at length. He writes of it at length, who writes about many words and works of Christ, as do the four Evangelists. He writes of it briefly, however, who does not tell of Christ's works, but indicates briefly how by his death and resurrection he has overcome sin, death, and hell for those who believe in him, as do St Peter and St Paul.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The doctrine of Justification by Faith</strong></p>
<p>If the Bible was one great plank of the 16th century Reformation, the doctrine of "justification by faith" was the other great plank. Luther tells us how he came to understand what this meant, when referring to his own spiritual state by 1519:</p>
<blockquote><div>however irreproachably I lived as a monk, I felt myself before God to be a sinner with a most unquiet conscience, nor could I be confident that I had pleased him with my satisfaction. I did not love, nay, rather I hated, this righteous God who punished sinners, and if not with tacit blasphemy, certainly with huge murmurings I was angry with God, saying; 'As though it really were not enough that miserable sinners should be eternally damned with original sin and <em>[then]</em> have all kinds of calamities laid upon them by the law of the Ten Commandments.</div></blockquote>
<p>Luther had an assured faith in the utter holiness of God and the sinfulness of human beings – not just in the wrong things they did, but how that human pride and self-absorption could be part of what was considered good. So how could Luther ever please and satisfy God? He tells us that the problem words for him were Paul's words in Romans 1.17:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous </em>[or just]<em> shall live by faith'.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>But then he writes:</p>
<blockquote><div>At last, God being merciful … I began to understand the justice of God as that by which the righteous man lives by the gift of God, namely, by faith; and this sentence 'the justice of God is revealed in the gospel' to be that passive justice with which the merciful God justifies us by faith, as it is written: 'The just lives by faith'. This straightway made me feel as though reborn and as though I had entered through open gates into Paradise itself.</div></blockquote>
<p>Luther came to see that, yes, his good works, including and even his confession of sin, would not be good enough to satisfy an all holy and righteous God. But the good news or the "gospel" was that God promised forgiveness for his sins. This was not on the basis of Luther's good works and confession, but on the basis of Jesus Christ's good works. These were perfect and on the Cross of Calvary by his death were offered up for Luther and the whole world that first Good Friday. So Luther could now trust (however inadequately) in Christ and God's promise of forgiveness and be absolutely assured. For he was now sharing in Christ's perfect righteousness which was reckoned as his through that faith union.</p>
<p>So what about good works? They were possible and necessary as evidence of genuine faith in Christ, but only because of the Holy Spirit received by God's grace through that faith in Christ. However, Luther remained adamant regarding two things: <em>one</em>, that you cannot love God as you ought with your natural powers apart from God's grace; and, <em>two</em>, this side of heaven even with God's grace and strength you are not able to perform works of perfect righteousness that earn merit. Yes, they please God but do not justify you. So you still need to shelter under Christ's righteousness and receive forgiveness. The great Anglican theologian and reformer of the Elizabethan period, Richard Hooker, explains these nuances as follows. He distinguished righteousness (or goodness) with regard to, <em>one</em>, justification (as you become a believer), <em>two</em>, sanctification (as you continue as a believer) and, <em>three</em>, glorification (life in heaven):</p>
<blockquote><div>There is a glorifying righteousness of men in the world to come; and there is a justifying and sanctifying righteousness here. The righteousness wherewith we shall be clothed in the world to come, is both perfect and inherent; that whereby here we are justified is perfect <em>[because Christ's]</em> but not inherent; that whereby we are sanctified, inherent but not perfect.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Post Script</strong></p>
<p>Luther was a remarkable man. So read more about him. There is an easy-read introduction to him in chapter 2 of Michael Reeves, <em>The Unquenchable Flame</em>. For Luther's fundamental theology read Luther's <em>The Bondage of the Will</em> in the edition of, and with an introduction by, J.I.Packer and O.R.Johnston.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Fight">(January 2018) The Fight</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2018</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>J.C.Ryle, the 19th century first bishop of Liverpool, wrote the classic Christian book, Holiness. It is a series of papers, many written before he became bishop in 1880. One, published not long after Jesmond Parish Church was founded in 1861 and undoubtedly read by many of our Founders, was on the struggle that is normal in the Christian life.</em></p>
<p>As we look forward into 2018 we cannot expect life to be easy for Christians - in the world, in the church and in their own personal lives. For we are all facing (and not least those in the educational world) what can be called "Bourgeois Religion". That, according to one commentator, "denotes the fusion of church culture with the moral consensus held by the good, respectable people who set the tone for society as a whole" and focuses on sexual morals. Following the sexual revolution of the '60s, the moral consensus progressively moved from contraception for everyone to easy divorce, to cohabitation, to recreational sex and now to homosexual sex and transgenderism. All have to be affirmed. And "during all this, the same consensus became hostile to those who say otherwise. It became 'cruel, 'hateful,' and 'bigoted' to call something wrong that the bourgeois consensus now deems right." So for the Christian there is a spiritual war going on. But Ryle has good advice. Bear in mind Ryle's language is Victorian and he quotes the old Authorized Version of the Bible, but the substance is as vital and challenging in 2018 as it was in the 19th century.</p>
<p><strong>True Christianity - A Fight</strong></p>
<p>True Christianity! Let us mind that word "true." There is a vast quantity of religion current in the world which is not true, genuine Christianity. It passes muster; it satisfies sleepy consciences; but it is not good money. It is not the real thing which was called Christianity eighteen hundred years ago. There are thousands of men and women who go to churches and chapels every Sunday, and call themselves Christians. Their names are in the baptismal register. They are reckoned Christians while they live. They are married with a Christian marriage service. They mean to be buried as Christians when they die. But you never see any "fight" about their religion! Of spiritual strife, and exertion, and conflict, and self-denial, and watching, and warring, they know literally nothing at all. Such Christianity may satisfy man, and those who say anything against it may be thought very hard and uncharitable; but it certainly is not the Christianity of the Bible. It is not the religion which the Lord Jesus founded, and his Apostles preached. It is not the religion which produces real holiness. True Christianity is "a fight."</p>
<p>The true Christian is called to be a soldier, and must behave as such from the day of his conversion to the day of his death. He is not meant to live a life of religious ease, indolence, and security. He must never imagine for a moment that he can sleep and doze along the way to heaven, like one travelling in an easy-carriage. If he takes his standard of Christianity from the children of this world, he may be content with such notions; but he will find no countenance for them in the Word of God. If the Bible is the rule of his faith and practice, he will find his course laid down very plainly in this matter. He must "fight."</p>
<p><strong>The Opposition</strong></p>
<p>With whom is the Christian soldier meant to fight? Not with other Christians. Wretched indeed is that man's idea of religion who fancies that it consists in perpetual controversy! He who is never satisfied unless he is engaged in some strife between church and church, chapel and chapel, sect and sect, faction and faction, party and party, knows nothing yet as he ought to know. No doubt it may be absolutely needful sometimes to appeal to law courts, in order to ascertain the right interpretation of a Church's Articles, and rubrics, and formularies. But, as a general rule, the cause of sin is never so much helped as when Christians waste their strength in quarrelling with one another, and spend their time in petty squabbles.</p>
<p>No, indeed! The principal fight of the Christian is with the world, the flesh, and the devil. These are his never-dying foes. These are the three chief enemies against whom he must wage war. Unless he gets the victory over these three, all other victories are useless and vain. If he had a nature like an angel, and were not a fallen creature, the warfare would not be so essential. But with a corrupt heart, a busy devil, and an ensnaring world, he must either "fight" or be lost.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting the Flesh</strong></p>
<p>Even after conversion he carries within him a nature prone to evil, and a heart weak and unstable as water. That heart will never be free from imperfection in this world, and it is a miserable delusion to expect it. To keep that heart from going astray, the Lord Jesus bids us <em>"watch and pray."</em> The spirit may be ready, but the flesh is weak. There is need of a daily struggle and a daily wrestling in prayer. <em>"I keep under my body,"</em> cries St. Paul, <em>"and bring it into subjection."</em> – <em>"I see a law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity."</em> – <em>"O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"</em> – <em>"They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."</em> – "Mortify your members which are upon the earth." (Mark 14.38; 1 Cor. 9.27; Rom. 7.23-24; Gal. 5.24; Col. 3.5.)</p>
<p><strong>Fighting the World</strong></p>
<p>The subtle influence of that mighty enemy must be daily resisted, and without a daily battle can never be overcome. The love of the world's good things – the fear of the world's laughter or blame – the secret desire to keep in with the world – the secret wish to do as others in the world do, and not to run into extremes – all these are spiritual foes which beset the Christian continually on his way to heaven, and must be conquered. <em>"The friendship of the world is enmity with God: whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." – "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." – "The world is crucified to Me, and I unto the world." – "Whatsoever is born God overcometh the world." – "Be not conformed to this world."</em> (James 4.4; 1 John 2.15; Gal.6.14; 1 John 5.4; Rom.12.2.)</p>
<p><strong>Fighting the Devil</strong></p>
<p>That old enemy of mankind is not dead. Ever since the fall of Adam and Eve he has been <em>"going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it,"</em> and striving to compass one great end – the ruin of man's soul. Never slumbering and never sleeping, he is always <em>"going about as a lion seeking whom he may devour."</em> An unseen enemy, he is always near us, about our path and about our bed, and spying out all our ways. A <em>"murderer and a liar"</em> from the beginning, he labours night and day to cast us down to hell. Sometimes by leading into superstition, sometimes by suggesting infidelity, sometimes by one kind of tactics and sometimes by another, he is always carrying on a campaign against our souls. <em>"Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat."</em> This mighty adversary must be daily resisted if we wish to be saved. But <em>"this kind goeth not out"</em> but by watching and praying, and fighting, and putting on the whole armour of God. The strong man armed will never be kept out of our hearts without a daily battle. (Job 1.7; 1 Peter 5.8; John 8.44; Luke 22.31; Eph. 6.11.)</p>
<p><strong>Too Strong Statements?</strong></p>
<p>Some men may think these statements too strong. You fancy that I am going too far, and laying on the colours too thickly. You are secretly saying to yourself, that men and women in England may surely get to heaven without all this trouble and warfare and fighting. Listen to me for a few minutes and I will show you that I have something to say on God's behalf. Remember the maxim of the wisest General that ever lived in England – "In time of war it is the worst mistake to underrate your enemy, and try to make a little war." This Christian warfare is no light matter. Give me your attention and consider what I say. What saith the Scripture? – <em>"Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life" – "Endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ." – "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the ruler of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand." – "Strive to enter in at the strait gate." – "Labour for the meat that endureth unto everlasting life." – "Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace but a sword." – " He that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one." – "Watch ye, stand fast in the faith: quit you like men, be strong." – "War a good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience."</em> (1 Tim. 6.12; 2 Tim 2.3; Eph. 6.11-13; Luke 13.24; John 6.27; Matt. 10.34; Luke 22.36; 1 Cor. 16.13; 1 Tim. 1.18-19.) Words such as these appear to me clear, plain and unmistakable. They all teach one and the same great lesson, if we are willing to receive it. That lesson is, that true Christianity is a struggle, a fight, and a warfare. He that pretends to condemn "fighting" and teaches that we ought to sit still and "yield ourselves to God," appears to me to misunderstand his Bible, and to make a great mistake.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Task Ahead - A snap-shot of Christianity in the North East">(February 2018) The Task Ahead - A snap-shot of Christianity in the North East</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2018</li><li>The Church of England</li></ul>

<p><strong>Nick Robinson (BBC Presenter):</strong> We're broadcasting from Lambeth Palace this morning and I've moved to the chapel where prayers will soon be held. Now if you choose to go to church this Christmas Eve, as so many of us will, you may struggle to find a place in the pews. But go to church just a week later, you'll probably be able to sit pretty much anywhere you like. This is a country that is becoming less and less religious and less and less Anglican. Fewer than a million attend Church of England services each week. That is less than the membership of the RSPB. Under the surface of the debates we so often hear about in the Church of England, whether it's about women bishops, or gay rights, is another debate: how to reach those people the Church currently struggles to reach.</p>
<p><em><strong>A Street Pastor:</strong>&nbsp;…We pray that as we go out with the privilege of being able to serve you, that we would be able to demonstrate the love that Jesus brought into this world…</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> God, we're told, moves in mysterious ways and here on Saturday night on the streets of Newcastle, the party capital of the Northeast, and home to 67,000 students, there are many wonders that need to be performed. The legends (sic) who help those too drunk to help themselves are Newcastle's street pastors.</p>
<p><em><strong>John Sinclair:</strong> Even when you're drunk, God loves you unconditionally.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> The Reverend Canon John Sinclair is one of those who patrols the streets of this city offering a mixture of practical help and God's love.</p>
<p><em><strong>John Sinclair:</strong> We do this, not to grow the church directly. The church forever really has said: here we are; come to us. Actually, we need to go out there because God is at work in people's lives out here so being out on the streets just makes the church available to them</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> There is, of course, nothing new in Christians reaching out beyond the pulpit. What is new, though, is the sense in the Church of England, that if they don't do so, the church risks an existential crisis. For the first time this year, more than half the British population describe themselves as having no religion. The percentage identifying themselves as Anglican has halved since the beginning of the Millennium to less than one in seven of the population</p>
<p><em><strong>Vox Pops:</strong></em><br><em>a) I don't not believe in it; I just never really thought about it.</em><br><em>b) I don't think much of the Church that much to be honest.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Christine Hardman:</strong> It does matter whether we manage to talk about God in a way that makes sense to people.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> Christine Hardman is the Bishop of Newcastle</p>
<p><em><strong>Christine Hardman:</strong> Rational discourse is now proving less effective actually in influencing and touching people. I think we're into a rather more emotional culture. I think story matters and I think lived out symbolism matches action matters and if I am trying to show the grace and truth of Jesus Christ – this is the scary bit – people will be taking more notice of how I am, what I do, than what I say.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> Who you are in what respect?</p>
<p><em><strong>Christine Hardman:</strong> Am I a loving person on the whole? Am I kind? Do I speak of faith in a way that sounds as if I mean it?</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> But what exactly it means to be a loving person is something the Church is desperately divided about. Some are yet to love women bishops. And a debate still rages about whether love between same-sex couples should be accepted, let alone celebrated</p>
<p><em><strong>Clayton TV musical intro and the voice of Ian Garrett:</strong>&nbsp;If you're a Christian actually the worst impact of sexual sin is not on our self-worth or image or any of the other things that get damaged. The worst impact is in our relationship with Jesus Christ.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> Jesmond Parish Church is one of two parishes in Newcastle that are still holding out against the appointment of women bishops. It also maintains a traditional line on sexual relationships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ian Garrett:</strong> Experiencing desires, like same-sex attraction, for what's outside God's will - that isn't sin but running those desires into practice is.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> It's an approach defended by Rod Thomas, the Bishop of Maidstone. He was appointed to minister to parishes that couldn't accept women in leadership roles. He believes that in a time of endless, often disorientating change, people crave certainty.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rod Thomas:</strong> By all means change how you go about seeking to reach people. But if you change your message, you cease to provide people with spiritual food and at the end of the day, the real need that people have is for their spiritual hunger to be satisfied and that can only be done when people are clear about the Gospel message.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> If for example some people say we need to change in our attitudes to sexuality, that's something you say no to?</p>
<p><em><strong>Rod Thomas:</strong> Well, we have to understand why people are more and more concerned about that sort of issue and part of the reason is because people are very concerned about their identity: what it is that makes them who they are; what it is that makes them human.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> But what have you got to say to gay men and women then?</p>
<p><em><strong>Rod Thomas:</strong> I think we've got a great message because what we've got to say is that, in Jesus Christ, we find our identity primarily in him and in what he's made us to be – one aspect of ourselves – which is our sexuality.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> This struggle between the Church's liberal and conservative wings is much more than a theological argument or one limited to the proceedings of the C of E's parliament, the General Synod. It's also about whether resisting social change, or embracing it, is more likely to make people turn up on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p><em><strong>Andy Mason:</strong> Welcome to St John's Gym.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> The Reverend Andy Mason runs a gym in St John's on the World's End estate just off the King's Road in Chelsea but a world away from it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Andy Mason:</strong> 12 years' ago when we came here we looked into how we could reach local guys and we looked at what local guys were doing. We saw they did two things: they smoked weed and they lifted weights. And we thought, we can't smoke weed with them but we can lift weights.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> Don't though confuse a change in the way this church communicates its message with a change to the message. This church was set up by a conservative evangelical group whose teaching would be seen by many as old fashioned.</p>
<p><em><strong>Andy Mason:</strong> We find actually that, if we care about people, love people, but actually talk clearly about what the Bible talks about, people are very interested so we've found that people are actually quite drawn to what some people would see as the traditional teachings of the Bible, historic Christianity. People are actually very engaged by that.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> Outside The Sinners Nightclub – yes The Sinners – Newcastle's street pastors have another call. Simon is huddled in an alleyway. They can't wake him but they leave him with a space blanket to keep out the cold. For those who can still walk, though not in the high heels they headed out in, the street pastors have another gift: flip flops. But shouldn't they be offered something else as well I asked the Bishop of Newcastle: advice that they're boozing too much, having too much sex and giving too little respect for God's values?</p>
<p><em><strong>Christine Hardman:</strong> When we go just telling people how they should behave, or criticising their style, that actually isn't the way we resonate. People have got these big questions: am I leading my life the right way? Does my life have meaning? I have all sorts of conversations at a very deep level with people. Very often when things are going with difficulty in people's lives and then we're open to asking those deep questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Robinson:</strong> Are you saying, at risk of being flippant, that what begins with the flip flops, can end with God?</p>
<p><em><strong>Christine Hardman:</strong> Yes. I am saying that Nick. </em></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Nashville Statement">(March 2018) Nashville Statement</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2018</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p>The February Jesmond Conference 2018 (for Anglican Clergy and other church leaders) was entitled <em>Sexual Chaos – causes and counteraction</em>. It had Bible readings given by Jonathan Pryke on Malachi 2 and 1 Corinthians 6 and the discussion of papers I gave on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The reason for, and the cost of, the chaos</li>
<li>Marriage, the problems and the Anglican Ideal</li>
<li>Homosexualism and Transgenderism</li>
<li>The way ahead for the church (and society)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first response was that the Conference supported the Nashville Statement (see below). This was composed by a Christian coalition of distinguished scholars, pastors and leaders meeting last August "in the hope of serving Christ's church" and can be signed individually (Google "Nashville Statement"). The final Jesmond Conference session was given over to hearing personal accounts of how individuals as Christians had handled conflict resulting from the sexual chaos in the Church and the world. The main sessions should all be on Clayton TV.</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>NASHVILLE STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Know that the Lord himself is God; It is he who has made us, and not we ourselves" </em>(Psalm 100.3)</div></blockquote>
<p>Evangelical Christians at the dawn of the twenty-first century find themselves living in a period of historic transition. As Western culture has become increasingly post-Christian, it has embarked upon a massive revision of what it means to be a human being. By and large the spirit of our age no longer discerns or delights in the beauty of God's design for human life. Many deny that God created human beings for his glory, and that his good purposes for us include our personal and physical design as male and female. It is common to think that human identity as male and female is not part of God's beautiful plan, but is, rather, an expression of an individual's autonomous preferences. The pathway to full and lasting joy through God's good design for his creatures is thus replaced by the path of shortsighted alternatives that, sooner or later, ruin human life and dishonour God.</p>
<p>This secular spirit of our age presents a great challenge to the Christian church. Will the church of the Lord Jesus Christ lose her biblical conviction, clarity, and courage, and blend into the spirit of the age? Or will she hold fast to the word of life, draw courage from Jesus, and unashamedly proclaim his way as the way of life? Will she maintain her clear, counter-cultural witness to a world that seems bent on ruin?</p>
<p>We are persuaded that faithfulness in our generation means declaring once again the true story of the world and of our place in it - particularly as male and female. Christian Scripture teaches that there is but one God who alone is Creator and Lord of all. To him alone, every person owes glad-hearted thanksgiving, heart-felt praise, and total allegiance. This is the path not only of glorifying God, but of knowing ourselves. To forget our Creator is to forget who we are, for he made us for himself. And we cannot know ourselves truly without truly knowing him who made us. We did not make ourselves. We are not our own. Our true identity, as male and female persons, is given by God. It is not only foolish, but hopeless, to try to make ourselves what God did not create us to be.</p>
<p>We believe that God's design for his creation and his way of salvation serve to bring him the greatest glory and bring us the greatest good. God's good plan provides us with the greatest freedom. Jesus said he came that we might have life and have it in overflowing measure. He is for us and not against us. Therefore, in the hope of serving Christ's church and witnessing publicly to the good purposes of God for human sexuality revealed in Christian Scripture, we offer the following affirmations and denials.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 1</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that God has designed marriage to be a covenantal, sexual, procreative, lifelong union of one man and one woman, as husband and wife, and is meant to signify the covenant love between Christ and his bride the church.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship. We also deny that marriage is a mere human contract rather than a covenant made before God.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 2</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that God's revealed will for all people is chastity outside marriage and fidelity within marriage.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that any affections desires, or commitments ever justify sexual intercourse before or outside marriage; nor do they justify any form of sexual immorality.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 3</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that God created Adam and Eve, the first human beings, in his own image, equal before God as persons and distinct as male and female.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that the divinely ordained difference between male and female render them unequal in dignity or worth.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 4</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> the divinely ordained difference between male and female reflect God's original creation design and are meant for human good and human flourishing.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that such differences are a result of the Fall or are a tragedy to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 5</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that the differences between male and female reproductive structures are integral to God's design for self-conception as male or female.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that physical anomalies or psychological conditions nullify the God appointed link between biological sex and self-conception as male or female.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 6</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that those born with a physical disorder of sex development are created in the image of God and have dignity and worth equal to all other image bearers. They are acknowledged by our Lord Jesus in his words about <em>"eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb."</em> With all others they are welcome as faithful followers of Jesus Christ and should embrace their biological sex insofar as it may be known.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that ambiguities related to a persons' biological sex render one incapable of living a fruitful life in joyful obedience to Christ.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 7</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that self-conception as male or female should be defined by God's holy purposes in creation and redemption as revealed in Scripture.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that adopting a homosexual or transgender self-conception is consistent with God's holy purposes in creation and redemption.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 8</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that people who experience sexual attraction for the same sex may live a rich and fruitful life pleasing to God through faith in Jesus Christ, as they, like all Christians, walk in purity of life.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that sexual attraction for the same sex is part of the natural goodness of God's original creation, or that it puts a person outside the hope of the gospel.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 9</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that sin distorts sexual desires by directing them away from the marriage covenant and toward sexual immorality – a distortion that includes both heterosexual and homosexual immorality.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that an enduring pattern of desire for sexual immorality justifies sexually immoral behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 10</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that it is sinful to approve of homosexual immorality or transgenderism and that such approval constitutes an essential departure from Christian faithfulness and witness.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that the approval of homosexual immorality or transgenderism is a matter of moral indifference about which otherwise faithful Christians should agree to disagree.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 11</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> our duty to speak the truth in love at all times, including when we speak to or about one another as male or female.<br><strong>We deny</strong> any obligation to speak in such ways that dishonour God's design of his image-bearers as male and female.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 12</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that the grace of God in Christ gives both merciful pardon and transforming power, and that this pardon and power enable a follower of Jesus to put to death sinful desires and to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that the grace of God in Christ is insufficient to forgive all sexual sins and to give power for holiness to every believer who feels drawn into sexual sin.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 13</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that the grace of God in Christ enables sinners to forsake transgender self-conceptions and by divine forbearance to accept the God-ordained link between one's biological sex and one's self-conception as male or female.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that the grace of God in Christ sanctions self-conceptions that are at odds with God's revealed will.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE 14</strong><br><strong>We affirm</strong> that Christ Jesus has come into the world to save sinners and that through Christ's death and resurrection forgiveness of sins and eternal life are available to every person who repents of sin and trusts in Christ alone as Saviour, Lord, and supreme treasure.<br><strong>We deny</strong> that the Lord's arm is too short to save or that any sinner is beyond his reach.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="'Be Separate" - A Billy Graham Message">(April 2018) "Be Separate" - A Billy Graham Message</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2018</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>Billy Graham, who was one of the most influential Christians in the 20th century, died recently, aged 99. As a school-boy I heard him on his first visits to England in 1954 and 1955. In 1959 Billy Graham gave an address on Christian Separation after (or during) a visit to West Point military academy (the US equivalent of our Sandhurst). Graham had been challenged by the discipline and commitment of the cadets, compared to the discipline and commitment of so many of us in the Church of Jesus Christ. He said of the visit: "As I looked out upon that sea of determined, dedicated young faces – some of the cream of American youth – I could not help but think of the weak, emaciated, milquetoast Christians in the average church who claim to be following Jesus Christ." As a tribute to the man and a challenge also to ourselves, the following is that 1959 address (used with permission). How we should thank God for Billy Graham!</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p>While the nation sees an increase of crime, immorality, adultery, drunkenness, irreverence, infidelity and open apostasy, millions of professing Christians have forgotten the word of Scripture that says, <em>"If anyone would come after me, let him … take up his cross daily"</em> (Luke 9.23 ESV).&nbsp;Our Lord regarded his followers as a select company that belonged to a different world from other people. He warned the disciples to be loyal to his teachings and principles. He told them that they were to set their affection on things above.&nbsp;He also warned that they would find circumstances exceedingly difficult. Refusing to conform to worldly principles, and living under the lordship of Christ, they would soon become marked men. He told them that the world would hate them.</p>
<p>They could not make their light shine by sinking to the world's low level. It was only by abiding in Christ and living under the ruling power of his Holy Spirit that they could elevate the world. The power and progress of the Christian Church would depend on its unlikeness to the world and its likeness to Jesus Christ.&nbsp;The distinction between the lives of those who lived for this world and those who lived for Christ's world was so clear that it made a deep impression on the pagan world of the first century. The early Christians influenced thousands to embrace the Christian faith because they were more loving and more considerate than their neighbours.&nbsp;Christ meant for his followers to be different. But being merely different was not enough. They were to be the cleanest, kindest, most industrious, most thoughtful, truest and most loving people on Earth.</p>
<p>The world of today is just as pagan in spirit as it was 2000 years ago. In recent years, the most cultured nations in the world have been guilty of acts of barbarianism that would have shocked even pagan Rome.&nbsp;Millions no longer worship stone idols, but they do worship fleshly idols. They worship film and TV stars, sex, success, wealth and money, but they have little place for God. The TV set has become the sanctuary of millions in an atmosphere that is hostile to spiritual growth.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the American church has become merged with the world. It has adopted so many of the world's ideals and standards that it has lost its ability to stem the tide of crime, deception and immorality that is sweeping the nation. For millions of Church members there is no deep commitment to the cause of Christ, no regularity of attendance at public worship, no sacrificial giving, no personal religious discipline.&nbsp;The aim of many churches today seems to be to get names on a list, and the deeper meaning of Christ's call for discipleship is neglected. Therefore, the world has moved into the Church. There is apparent success, but in reality there is tragic failure. Quaker theologian Elton Trueblood once said, "Our main mission field today, so far as America is concerned, is within the Church membership itself."</p>
<p>Ezekiel's parable of the valley of dry bones pictures Israel as dried up and nearly lost, with no evidence of life. All that remain are the bones, dry and dead. This is true of hundreds of churches today. The organization is going smoothly, but there is little life.&nbsp;The thrilling thing about Ezekiel's story, however, is that new life is possible. The miracle of regeneration can occur: <em>"Breathe on these slain, that they may live"</em> (Ezekiel 37.9).&nbsp;Though Ezekiel was talking about Israel, his parable applies equally well to the Church of Christ. The Church can be revived. God's interest is not merely in reaching outsiders, important as they are; he is concerned equally with changing the insiders. The call of Christ is for rededication to him – a call to follow him, to pattern our lives after his.</p>
<p>As Christians, of course, we must live in the world. We must infiltrate the world with a purpose to help win the world. But we are not to participate in the evils of the world. There are certain things that a Christian must say "No" to – in politics, in the shop, in the office. We must show that we are citizens of another world, and many times we may suffer misunderstanding and persecution because of it.&nbsp;We should refuse to support anything that does not meet with the approval of our Christian conscience. Thousands of professing Christians are betraying their Christian principles because they are more concerned for the world's smile than the commendation of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that the casual Christian has little influence upon others. It is only the Christian who refuses to compromise in matters of honesty, integrity and morality that is bearing an effective witness for Christ.&nbsp;Worldly Christians are prepared to do as the world does. They will condone dishonest and unethical practices because they are afraid of the world's displeasure. Only by a life of obedience to the voice of the Spirit, by a daily dying of self, by a full dedication to Christ and constant fellowship with him, are we enabled to live a godly and influential life in this ungodly world.</p>
<p>Many Christians, however, have misunderstood worldliness. Certain elements of daily life are not sinful in themselves but have a tendency to lead to sin if they are abused. Abuse literally means 'overuse' or 'extreme use' of lawful things which then becomes a sin.&nbsp;Pleasure is lawful in its use, but unlawful in its overuse. Ambition is an essential part of true character, but it must be fixed on lawful objects and exercised in proper proportion. Our occupation, reading, dress, friendships and other aspects of life are legitimate and necessary but they can easily become illegitimate, unnecessary and harmful.</p>
<p>Thousands of people engaged in various business enterprises have sold their souls to the devil for an extra dollar. They are willing to cheat, lie and steal in order to make more money. Worldliness is a spirit, an atmosphere, an influence permeating human society, and we need to guard against it constantly and strenuously.&nbsp;The Bible says, <em>"Do not love the world or the things in the world"</em> (1 John 2.15). The Bible also warns that the world and the desires for it shall pass away, but he who does the will of God abides forever (cf 1 John 2.17). To the Romans, Paul wrote, <em>"Do not be conformed to this world"</em> (Rom 12.2). To the Corinthians, he wrote, <em>"Go out … and be separate"</em> (2 Corinthians 6.17). James says, <em>"Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God"</em> (James 4.4).</p>
<p>These Scriptures clearly teach that the Christian is to be in the world, but not of it; separated from it, yet a witness to it; not molded by it, but exerting an influence for good over it; not compromising with it, but challenging it; not coming down to its level, but seeking to lift souls up to a higher level.</p>
<p>There must be an out-and-out stand for Christ. It does not mean that in society we are snobs or have a superiority complex. But the Christian should stand out like a sparkling diamond against a rough background. He (or she) should be more wholesome than anyone else. He should be poised, cultured, courteous, gracious, but firm in the things he does or does not do. He should laugh and be radiant; but he should refuse to allow the world to pull him down to its level.</p>
<p>The greatest need today in Christendom is a revival within the church of dedicated, separated, disciplined Christians, living for the Lord Jesus. The Bible says, <em>"I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect"</em> (Romans 12.1-2).</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Hell And Modern Mores">(May 2018) Hell And Modern Mores</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2018</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Confusion</strong></p>
<p>A month ago, on Good Friday, the front page of <em>The Times</em> newspaper had the following headline under a large picture of the Pope, <em>Thank heavens: Pope puts Hell in doubt</em>. A reporter then wrote:</p>
<blockquote><div>Hell, it turns out, is not a fiery pit of eternal damnation. Neither does it involve varieties of extreme torment. Rather, the punishment for sinners upon death is simply that they disappear.</div></blockquote>
<p>The Vatican press office then denied that these words were a faithful transcription of what the Pope actually had said in answer to a question. So assuming the Pope is orthodox, <em>The Times</em> certainly is not. For inside the newspaper the main editorial was given over to this subject of ultimate judgment under the sub-heading: "The Pope's suggestion that Hell is imaginary shows his instinct to reconcile the eternal truths with the mores and understanding of the modern age." It then began:</p>
<blockquote><div>In church services today across the world, Christians will recall the fate of a figure nailed to a cross, flanked by two criminals, in ancient Palestine. More than that, they will affirm their faith that Jesus of Nazareth was both human and divine, and that in his crucifixion, he voluntarily suffered and atoned for the sins of humanity. In two millennia since, Christ's followers have wondered and reasoned about the fate of those who are saved and those who are lost. This week the Pope has injected a distinctive view into this theological debate. In an interview with La Repubblica, he appears to suggest that Hell is an imaginary construct and that the fate of unrepentant sinners, rather than eternal torment, is to disappear.</div></blockquote>
<p>It then went on to say that if the Pope was accurately reported, he was saying only what other people have said who wanted a position that was "a humane one that accords with modern mores".</p>
<p><strong>The Reality of Hell</strong></p>
<p>So what do we say to all this? First, let me say how one theologian begins to answer that question:</p>
<blockquote><div>To any normal person the thought that people one knows and cares for, not to mention oneself, might face a destiny that could be described as eternal punishment, will be profoundly disturbing. It rudely disrupts the sort of peace of mind that we in the Western world cultivate today – the peace of mind, that is gained by constantly telling oneself that there is nothing to worry about and everything will work out all right in the end. But since this complacency is part of our culture, and is sniffed like glue in the air we breathe and does in fact operate as a deadening drug on the mind, it is a kind of knee-jerk reaction with us to resent having it disturbed. From thence comes our tendency to dismiss the doctrine of eternal punishment in all it forms as debased Christianity. We scoff at Hell Fire as a bad dream, the murky stamping ground of redneck fundamentalists, backwoods preachers, and old-fashioned Roman Catholics; and we write off the idea as a hangover from primitive ages now long past" - J.I. Packer</div></blockquote>
<p>But with that caution, we then need to say that the real trouble for the editorial writer in <em>The Times</em> is not with "the mores and understanding of the modern age" but with "the eternal truths" of the risen and reigning Jesus, the divine Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, the agent in the creation of this amazing universe and his teaching. For a fundamental part of his teaching, that was not just an echo of Jewish apocalyptic, was his doctrine of eternal punishment. As W.T. Shedd famously put it sometime ago but, nevertheless, still is true:</p>
<blockquote><div>The strongest support of the doctrine of Endless Punishment is the teaching of Christ, the Redeemer of men … Christ could not have warned so frequently and earnestly as he did against 'the fire that shall never be quenched' and 'the worm that dieth not', had he known that there is no future peril to fully correspond to them. Jesus Christ is the person who is responsible for the doctrine of Eternal Perdition. He is the being with whom all opponents of this theological tenet are in conflict.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is it Difficult to Believe?</strong></p>
<p>First, some people may still fail to realize that it is metaphorical language or the language of imagery that is being used to describe the reality of Hell. That is needed because it is beyond the power of human description to describe. So human imagination has to be put to work. Fire and darkness, two images used, are incompatible in a literal sense, of course. Where there is fire there cannot be darkness and vice-versa. However, both words are used to refer to the same condition, namely one of hopelessness that is unimaginably dreadful. Then logic takes over and says, 'I must avoid this at all costs – it is so terrible.'</p>
<p>Secondly, some cannot understand how a God of love can be connected with the idea even of such an unspeakable destiny as Hell. Must not the suggestion as extinction after death be, therefore, right? The problem comes because many fail to realize that the statement <em>"God is love"</em> is only one truth about God. John's first letter is the source of the proposition that <em>"God is love"</em> (1 John 4.8). But John then says also that God is light (1 John 1.5) and Jesus is righteous (1 John 3.7). It insists on divine moral holiness and absolute justice.&nbsp;That great Old Testament scholar, J.A. Motyer writes:</p>
<blockquote><div>It is not easy to come to a single definition of the divine nature. Alongside the incredibly benevolent God of Genesis 2, ever thoughtful of Adam's welfare, there is the God of Genesis 3, with his stern questions, his imposition of a curse on that which he had earlier given in blessing, and his personal action in driving out the first pair and placing a flaming sword to prevent their return … The same apparent opposites occur, however, and the same variety of attributes in the Lord Jesus, yet all of them are unified into one Person! … We must never imagine that the existence of love and wrath in the same nature is evidence of a split personality, but only evidence that God is greater than can be grasped in our finite logic. The one divine attribute which more than any other is suggested by the Bible as the sufficient description of God is 'holiness'.</div></blockquote>
<p>God's holiness cannot tolerate sin. But such intolerance was especially seen at the moment of God's ultimate expression and proof of his love for sinners – at Calvary, on that first Good Friday to which <em>The Times</em> editorial referred. This was when Jesus <em>"became sin"</em> for us. But at that point our Holy God was unable to tolerate such a one in his presence. So Jesus cried, <em>"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</em></p>
<p>Biblical 'holiness' means two things (at least) with regard to God. First that he is utterly transcendent – <em>"high and lifted up"</em> and so distant from us; and secondly, his moral character (that gives rise to his Ten Commandments). And, as Isaiah tells us (Isaiah 6) such experienced holiness brings immediate conviction of our own sinfulness. "If we were frank," writes Motyer, "we would admit that we rarely see sin as a serious thing; our imagination will not even stretch to seeing why God was so 'intolerant' towards Adam and Eve, or Ananias and Sapphira, or any others who came under his wrath. In other words, a sinner's imagination is no gauge to the reactions of a Holy God, and we need to beware of imprisoning the Almighty within the meagre grasp of our fallen nature."</p>
<p><strong>The Good News</strong></p>
<p>But the good news is that Hell is not the last word. John in his Gospel could not be clearer – John 3.16-21:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>It could not be clearer. Hell is not God's choice. For the love of God is reflected in the fact that Jesus, God incarnate, suffered Hell, that ultimate separation from the Father, for you and me. That means if by faith <em>"you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved"</em> (Romans 10.9) for now and for eternity.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Abortion, Ireland, What Next? (Part 1)">(June 2018) Abortion, Ireland, What Next? (Part 1)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2018</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                <p>W.B. Yeats, Irish poet, fascist, and spiritualist, for all his weird views brilliantly penned the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>the centre cannot hold … the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.</div></blockquote>
<p>In the abortion Referendum in Ireland, at the end of May, the majority voted to legalize abortion. These are the 'passionate' who hold an ethic of so-called rights, in particular the right of a woman to require a doctor to kill her unborn baby. But that ethic has been given such publicity, it seems over recent years to have led to a loss of 'conviction' on the part of those supporting the ethic that no doctor should perform an abortion. Yet that was the normative ethic for humanitarian communities since the Greek Hippocrates, 'the Father of Medicine' (BC 460-370), and certainly since the time of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Scripture</strong></p>
<p>The traditional Christian ethic follows the witness of the Bible: namely that abortion together with research destructive of nascent human life are, in principle, wrong. The Bible provides at least five pointers that lead to this conclusion.</p>
<p>First, violence to the foetus is considered a lesser offence than violence to the mother, but offence it still is (Exodus 21.22). Secondly, a reverent agnosticism and humility over the generation of human life is to be encouraged: <em>"you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child"</em> (Ecclesiastes 11.5). Thirdly, the history from conception, of that which is in the womb belongs to a discrete individual and not to a mere combination of cells: <em>"The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name"</em> (Isaiah 49.1). Fourthly, according to the Gospel narrative, the incarnation of the Son of God – the revelation of what is truly human – began not with Jesus' birth but conception. As the Creed says, <em>"He was conceived..."</em> And, fifthly, human life is a 'gift': <em>"the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away" </em>(Job 1.21).</p>
<p>So human life or being a human individual is not an 'achievement'. This last consideration means that the duty to protect human life is not based on any 'achievement', whether of physical performance or psychological development. Indeed, such a grounding has sometimes led to a totalitarian exclusion from the category of the 'human' of non-achievers. This is because of non-achieving in terms of racial origin, adult mental health or even political views. They are then treated as 'sub-human'. That was the wickedness of the 18th and 19th century slave trade. Rather the duty to protect human life is based on the 'given' fact of young or old, well or ill, developing or developed, being in the image of God:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image" </em>(Genesis 9.6).</div></blockquote>
<p>In the jargon, a person's humanity depends on ontological rather than functional factors (what someone 'is' rather than on what someone can 'do').</p>
<p><strong>Tradition</strong></p>
<p>The principles that gave rise to the Christian ethic of 'no abortion' are not only there in the Bible. They have been underlined by Church tradition, in Canon Law and other Church pronouncements. These have been pretty uniformly of opposition to abortion from the earliest days of the Church until some ideas of liberal Protestants in the last third of the 20th century. The early Christians would have judged such teachers as heretics. They, too, knew there were alterative points of view. For abortion and infanticide were common in the ancient world. Yes, they preached forgiveness through the Cross of Christ for any sin, including abortion. But as is well documented in the period of the early church Fathers, the Church was noted for resisting abortion and extending protection to developing human life. In this they were quite counter-cultural. So Ireland and much of the West is not being progressive. Rather it is going back to pre-Christian times.</p>
<p>The earliest Church 'manual', the Didache, speaks of "two ways, one of life and one of death." To avoid the way of death, it includes prohibitions not only of murder, adultery, "corrupting boys", fornication, stealing, magic, sorcery, but it also says,</p>
<blockquote><div>do not murder a child by abortion or kill a newborn infant.</div></blockquote>
<p>Another example is Clement of Alexandria (AD 150-215), an early theologian, who wrote that those who "in order to hide their immorality, use abortive drugs which expel the matter completely dead, abort at the same time their human feelings."</p>
<p><strong>Reason</strong></p>
<p>But it is not only Scripture (the Bible) and tradition that witness to the wrongness of abortion but also reason. For a start, abortion is now known to be damaging to people who have abortions, as Clement hinted. The sheer lie that all is well with having an abortion is a wicked lie. I have been in meetings where I have heard women speak of their experiences; and they were uniformly bad and sad. John Wyatt, the distinguished neonatologist, documents some:</p>
<blockquote><div>After the abortion I felt relief. I was just pleased to have made a decision. However, as time goes by, I realize what I have lost. I miss my child. I feel empty and guilty. It was a horrific experience which will stay with me for a long time. I don't blame myself because I know I was upset and confused.""On the day of the procedure I was petrified, and I cried for hours. I felt like the worst person in the world. I couldn't understand how I was about to murder my own child. I love children dearly and had previously worked as a nanny. I just didn't know where all my emotions were coming from … Now I think about it every day. I think about how selfish I am. I have nightmares of giving birth, of looking for my lost child. I fear that this has been made worse by the lie to my partner, and the guilt I feel as he too is struggling with the situation.""The day I 'terminated' my baby is the day my life changed forever. I have three beautiful children and whenever I say that to people, I always feel a lump in my throat as I so want to say 'four'. When I look back (four years ago now), I see so clearly the huge mistake my husband and I made, but it is so weird that at the time you just don't see it. Maybe your mind is fogged with sickness, financial worries, or lots of other 'reasons' that seem so acceptable at the time. As soon as I woke from the anesthetic I cried and cried, not from relief but from regret.</div></blockquote>
<p>I could give more. John Wyatt also tells of talking to a BBC producer who was making a major documentary on abortion. She told him how she interviewed doctors who used the politically correct phrase, "termination of pregnancy". However, in her view the women interviewed were more honest on abortion's emotional impact. They virtually all spoke about "killing their babies". But none of that should be surprising. For abortion seems to be a breaking of what the theologians call "natural law" to which our consciences witness. Paul describes that in Romans 2.14-16.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There is much more to say about Scripture, Tradition and Reason and how there cannot be a general moral right for a woman to require a doctor to kill her unborn baby. But if there are compelling grounds to say abortion is wrong, how were so many persuaded to vote to overturn the 8th Amendment in Ireland? One reason was that half-truths were told regarding sad cases. For example, on the day after the Referendum result was known, <em>The Observer</em> newspaper wrote:</p>
<blockquote><div>The tragic, avoidable death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 became the rallying cry for reform. Denied an abortion when she began to miscarry, she died of sepsis in hospital a week later. Over the years, there have been many more cases that illustrate the costs of religious fundamentalism trumping compassion and common sense.</div></blockquote>
<p>But the Sunday Telegraph had the honesty to mention regarding Savita Halappanavar the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>it would later emerge that her death was more medical incompetence and carelessness than denial of abortion, but few care about the facts.</div></blockquote>
<p>More, too, is to be said about hard cases; but legalizing abortion is only minimally about hard cases.</p>
<p>The latest figures for abortion in England and Wales for 2016 are that 190,406 abortions were carried out. Only 1.7% (3,208) were for the risk that the child would be born 'seriously handicapped'! So 187,198 healthy human individuals were killed in 2016 by the medical profession in England and Wales. We are talking about most abortions being 'social' abortions. That is very serious. So what next? Part 2 is to follow.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Abortion, Ireland, What Next? (Part 2)">(August 2018) Abortion, Ireland, What Next?

                                                <p><strong>A tectonic moral shift</strong></p>
<p>What was, and is, behind the fact that in the abortion Referendum in Ireland at the end of May 2018 the majority voted to legalize abortion? And why are the latest official annual figures for abortion in England and Wales those shocking figures with which I concluded Part 1? The simple answer to those questions of 'what?' and 'why?' is that a tectonic moral shift is taking place in Europe and in other parts of the Western world. And it is this moral shift that is behind the "dramatic and utterly unforeseen collapse of Catholicism in Ireland in little more than a generation", to quote Professor Richard Rex, the Cambridge historian.</p>
<p>So Roman Catholics in Ireland, buying into this moral shift, undoubtedly caused their Referendum's green light on abortion. But, of course, this is not just a Roman Catholic problem. It is affecting Protestants as well. However, Rex also says this tectonic moral shift has to be seen in the light of world history. For it harks back to two other such crises in the church. The first of these was the Arian crisis and the second was the Reformation. The Arian crisis centred on the deity and manhood of Jesus Christ. That was in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, from the Council of Nicaea to the Council of Chalcedon.</p>
<blockquote><div>This was an agonized and church-rending argument over the question, 'What is God'.</div></blockquote>
<p>The crisis was resolved, of course, with the mainstream Church's doctrine of the Trinity of one God, but Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and the Son, Jesus Christ being fully God and fully man. And this doctrine is expressed in the Athanasian Creed. However, Rex goes on like this:</p>
<blockquote><div>The second great crisis was that of the Reformation … an agonized and church-rending argument over the question, 'What is the Church <em>[and Salvation]</em>?' Our <em>[contemporary]</em> crisis, at least as great as those, is all about a question that would once have been expressed as 'What is man?' The fact that this wording is now itself seen as problematic is a symptom of the very condition it seeks to diagnose. 'What is it, in other words, to be human?</div></blockquote>
<p>So abortion is just one aspect of a much wider argument about the nature of humanity, human life and human sexuality. Rex reminds us of "tensions in Western culture as a whole, relating to an entire alphabet of beliefs and practices: abortion, bisexuality, contraception, divorce, euthanasia, family, gender, homosexuality, infertility treatment." And he adds, that the way these issues are playing out indicate "a moral shift of an epochal nature."</p>
<p><strong>Philosophically</strong></p>
<p>What then has led to this moral shift? Looked at philosophically one thing was this. The Western world of the 20th century developed "habits of the heart" and a belief system that was "subjectivist". That is to say, somehow it has allowed what are classed as "values" – the things we label "good" or "to be desired" etc. – to be seen as just the result of our subjective feelings. So it is said, "there is nothing inherent in what is 'good', or 'to be desired'. It is simply what we 'like'. So I can like one thing; but you can like another."</p>
<p>C.S.Lewis was provoked into writing <em>The Abolition of Man</em> in 1943 over this issue, in the middle of the Second World War with Hitler still doing his worst. He had been sent a complimentary copy of a book on English intended for "boys and girls in the upper forms of schools". In one chapter the authors refer to the poet and philosopher, Coleridge, at a waterfall with two tourists present. One called it "sublime" and the other "pretty", with Coleridge mentally endorsing the first judgment but rejecting the second with disgust. The authors of the English book comment:</p>
<blockquote><div>When the man said <em>This is sublime</em>, he appeared to be making a remark about the waterfall … Actually … he was not making a remark about the waterfall, but a remark about his own feelings. What he was saying was really <em>I have feelings associated in my mind with the word 'Sublime</em>, shortly, <em>I have sublime feelings</em> … This confusion is continually present in language as we use it. We appear to be saying something very important about something: and actually we are only saying something about our own feelings.</div></blockquote>
<p>Lewis' entire little book, <em>The Abolition of Man</em>, follows on from that. But his initial reaction included this:</p>
<blockquote><div>the schoolboy who reads this passage … will believe two propositions: firstly, that all sentences containing a predicate of values are statements about the emotional state of the speaker; and, secondly, that all such statements are unimportant … And <em>[the schoolboy]</em> has no notion that ethics, theology, and politics are all at stake. It is not a theory they <em>[the authors]</em> put into his mind but an assumption, which ten years hence, its origin forgotten and its presence unconscious, will condition him to take one side in a controversy which he has never recognized as a controversy at all.</div></blockquote>
<p>So when people like these boys, <em>one</em>, later are persuasively told that some lives "are not worth living"; <em>two</em>, are asked to vote on abortion; <em>three</em>, have ceased to believe in objective values; and, <em>four</em>, have had no biblical and traditional Christian teaching at home or at school on abortion (see the June 2018 <em>Coloured Supplement</em>), they will vote "Yes", <em>feeling</em> abortion to be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>The doctrine of objective value</strong></p>
<p>However, the Bible is so clear about 'objective value'. Paul in Romans 1.19 argues that human beings all have had some knowledge of God and the reality of his holy divine nature:</p>
<blockquote><div>what can be known about God is plain to them <em>[human beings]</em>, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honour him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</div></blockquote>
<p>Paul then argues in verses 24-32 of Romans chapter 1 that in their folly fallen men and women have "exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator." And, importantly, they no longer affirm common sense traditional values and morals – objective values. For their darkness has led to the divine removal of restraints resulting in sexual decadence, particularly same-sex decadence – yes, Paul highlights that. This, we are told, then leads to further serious moral and social breakdown. But there is no suggestion that the moral law and objective values have gone into hibernation. As Romans 2.14-16 says:</p>
<blockquote><div>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</div></blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that once you read key writers from other faiths and philosophies, ("Gentiles" such as Aristotle, Cicero, Mohammed etc.), not only is there that with which we have profoundly to disagree, there is also evidence of that universal moral law "written on their hearts". But it is also obvious that once you flout God's moral law – our Creator's design for the good life – and the belief, as Lewis puts it, "that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are," there will be serious trouble. Interestingly, Holland was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage on 1 April 2001 and also latest statistics show annual deaths by euthanasia in Holland increasing by 10% to 6091. Is it, then, a coincidence that on the 30 July 2018 a headline in <em>The Times</em> newspaper was, "Amsterdam is lawless jungle after dark"? The report went on:</p>
<blockquote><div>Arre Zuurmond, the ombudsman said, 'Criminal money flourishes, there is no authority and the police can no longer handle the situation … Mr Zuurmond moved into the heart of the tourist centre for two weeks to see for himself the problems of the city known for its red-light district. 'One night we counted 900 offences,' he said. 'There's violence but no action.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>But to believe we live in a moral universe that is subject to divine law is just a start. The modern crisis requires a return to a truly Christian humanism – the subject of Part 3.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Abortion, Ireland, What Next?

                                                <p><em>Re-reading on holiday </em>Christianity: The True Humanism<em> (from 1985) by J.I.Packer and Thomas Howard, I realized that, as an appendix, was attached </em>A Christian Humanist Manifesto<em>. This had appeared in 1982 in </em>Eternity<em> magazine (now defunct). Packer and Howard were among the many consultants who helped to determine its final shape and content. August's Coloured Supplement, Part 2 of </em>Abortion, Ireland, What Next?<em> concluded with "to believe we live in a moral universe that is subject to divine law is just the start. The modern crisis requires a return to a truly Christian humanism – the subject of Part 3."</em></p>
<p><em>This manifesto is a helpful starting point for that return.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Starting Point</strong></p>
<p>The proper study of mankind is not man alone, but God and man together. The triune God – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – is the Creator of the Universe and of each person within it. God, who is the ultimate meaning of the universe, is eternally self-existent, though the created order is not.</p>
<p>By thus acknowledging God, the Christian view of reality embraces more than does that of the secular humanist.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>Human nature combines physical and spiritual, natural and supra-natural characteristics. To the physical, sexual, and social aspects of normal human life, in which we rejoice, must be added the understanding that human beings alone of all creation are made in God's own image.</p>
<p>We can, therefore, create, love, assert, reflect on our past and future, communicate with words, and distinguish good and evil. Even more fundamentally we can worship the One whose image we bear. This gives man an intrinsic dignity beyond mere animals. Human beings can never be understood only as animals, however complex, for at heart they are religious beings.</p>
<p><strong>Value of Life</strong></p>
<p>Because human beings, male and female, bear God's image, their life, which is his gift, claims our care and protection throughout, from the time of conception to the furthest point at which it can continue. Neither abortions of convenience nor euthanasia when social usefulness has passed can therefore be justified.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Exist</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of human life is moral and spiritual: moral, in the performance of God's will, which is both just and loving; spiritual, in a fellowship with God and other persons. No human life, however prosperous, healthy, or devoted to others is complete when this moral and spiritual development is lacking.</p>
<p><strong>The Human Task</strong></p>
<p>From his creation, man as male and female has been given stewardship over nature, commanded by God to develop a culture and nourish human life from the productive earth.</p>
<p>Labour and leisure, science and art, family and state, belong to human life as God meant it to be. Yet the meaning of life is not found in these activities but in the God who enables them.</p>
<p><strong>Science and Art</strong></p>
<p>God created and maintains pattern and consistency in the universe, making science and technology possible. Secular humanism, lacking this ultimate foundation for science, must posit the consistency of the universe as a mysterious 'given'.</p>
<p>The form and materials of his creation also make art and beauty possible: human creativity thus echoes God's own.</p>
<p><strong>Truth and Error</strong></p>
<p>Something of God's character and will may be known by all people, even if dimly and with confusion. An awareness of God and of moral standards is natural to mankind, and the urge to worship, though often misdirected, is indestructible.</p>
<p>God the Creator has clearly revealed his character and will in history, culminating in Jesus Christ. This revelation, in which God interpreted for us the whole of human life and met in principle the whole of human duty, is now permanently available in Holy Scripture; and no one who lacks knowledge of it knows enough for a fully human life.</p>
<p>Though we know only in part, God's revealed truth is absolute, not relative. Because truth can be known, error can be identified, and a path is thereby opened through the contemporary religious and philosophical confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Evil</strong></p>
<p>Human life is blighted by the alienation from God introduced by human disobedience after man's creation. Moral evil, though universal throughout history, is therefore abnormal. Its root lies in human rebellion against God's Lordship and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Ours has become a bent world: selfishness, violence, injustices, pride, self-destructiveness, and inhumanity everywhere pervade human life.</p>
<p>This evil may appear in individuals or institutions. It is manifest in governments, businesses, and families. The human will, rather than social conditions alone, however, is the decisive factor in evil. No explanation of human brutality that omits sinful choice is adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Providence</strong></p>
<p>In the face of this pervasive evil, God maintains a governance of human affairs that sets limits to evil, prospers human life, and preserves his purposes in history. The end of history, like its beginning, is under the sovereign control of God.</p>
<p><strong>Human Restoration: Reconciled to God</strong></p>
<p>To end our alienation from him and to restore human life to its original design and purpose, our Creator has acted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, a first-century Jew, who was, in truth, the second person of the Trinity, God incarnate.</p>
<p>The appearance of Christ, therefore, is the most important event in all human history. By his sacrificial death, he paid the moral debt of those sinners who submit to his transforming reconciliation.</p>
<p>The loving service of God and man, which Jesus taught and practiced perfectly, is the model of true humanness.</p>
<p><strong>The Kingdom of God Begun</strong></p>
<p>From the ministry of Christ sprang an international, multiracial community of forgiven sinners. They acknowledge a common calling to proclaim Jesus as King and to bring all human life under his sway. This community, the Church, despite failures, inconsistencies, and hypocrisies, has pioneered a many-sided humanitarianism.</p>
<p>The Christian movement has been the cultural matrix of the modern Western world. Christian fruit, however, cannot continue in society without Christian convictions.</p>
<p><strong>World Crisis</strong></p>
<p>Current social and political problems are overwhelming: international tensions, crime, family breakdown, abuse of the powerless (including the unborn and the aged), scarcity of resources, nuclear threat, and more.</p>
<p>Christian humanism offers, not a program to solve these problems, but a framework for their solutions – truth linked to spiritual power.</p>
<p><strong>Pessimism, Optimism, Realism</strong></p>
<p>Human life is not perfectible and progress is not inevitable, but despair at the human prospect is no more justified than is naïve optimism. Hope for mankind lies in the knowledge that Jesus Christ, the Lord of all things, will make all things new at his Second Coming. The Christian Humanist therefore avoids both the pessimism and the over optimism of secular humanism.</p>
<p>The individual Christian facing death, can likewise know that conscious friendship with God and other persons is forever. Death can destroy the body, but it does not destroy the person or meaning.</p>
<p>In contrast to secular humanism, therefore, Christian humanism does not hesitate to speak of absolute truth, goodness, beauty, love, morality, the sanctity of life, duty, fidelity, hope and immortality. These are not empty religious sentiments but the natural language of those who know, even if partially, of their creation and redemption by a loving God.</p>
<blockquote><div>God has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end" (Ecclesiastes 3.11).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Lying and the Erosion of Truth">(October 2018) Lying and the Erosion of Truth</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2018</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The biblical background</strong></p>
<p>The appointment to the Supreme Court in the USA to fill its final vacancy last month brought to the attention of the World a moral sickness at the heart of modern Western, culture – namely lying. An ethicist writes:</p>
<blockquote><div>In a society where deceit and falsehood have apparently become an essential part of personal living, trade and industry, advertising, politics and international relationships, Christians are called to demonstrate, in life and word, truth that reflects the nature of God.</div></blockquote>
<p>So how are we to think about this problem? What for a start is the nature of God? Well, in the Old Testament Isaiah speaks of <em>"the God of truth"</em> (65.16). In the New Testament in John's gospel we read of Jesus saying: <em>"I am … the truth"</em> (14.6). And in the same gospel we read that the Holy Spirit is called <em>"the Spirit of truth"</em> (15.26). Our Trinitarian God is, therefore, the very opposite of the evil one, the devil. For also in John's gospel Jesus describes the devil as having <em>"nothing to do with the </em>truth,<em> because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies"</em> (8.44). So we need to resist the temptation to lie. Genesis says the very first sin was the serpent lying to Eve in the Garden of Eden (3.4). Proverbs says: <em>"Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord"</em> (12.22). Paul writes to the Colossians: <em>"Do not lie to one another"</em> (3.9). And in Revelation lying is the very last sin mentioned in the Bible: <em>"as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death"</em> (21.8).</p>
<p><strong>The erosion of truth</strong></p>
<p>This current erosion particularly started in the second half of the 20th century with a secular utilitarian ethic, namely "if it works, it is justifiable". But is it? For example, a lawyer, Charles Curtis thinks so: "I don't see why we should not come out roundly and say that one of the functions of the lawyer is to lie for his client." Hitler, of course, earlier had this ethic in justifying the 'big lie': "the great masses of the people … will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one." Today, of course, the "big lie" comes from the media, not least mainstream broadcasting. This often is by broadcasting or writing just one side of a story, thus communicating a distorted and false message. This is the Pinsky Principle, named after an American Journalist, Walter Pinsky. It says: "if my research and journalistic instincts tell me one thing, my political instincts another … I won't fudge it, I won't bend it, but I won't write it!" But such a culture of lying and misinformation results in a dangerous brainwashing. The remarkable philosopher Hannah Arendt writes as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>It has frequently been noted that the surest result of brainwashing in the long run is a peculiar kind of cynicism, the absolute refusal to believe the truth of anything, no matter how well it may be established. In other words, the result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth, and truth be defamed as lie, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world – and the categories of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end – is being destroyed.</div></blockquote>
<p>That is undoubtedly happening in Britain. For, according to opinion polls there is an increase in terms of belief in the "nones" – the people who don't want to commit themselves to any definite worldview including the Christian worldview, in spite of all the evidence for it. But only one-third of those are positively atheist. That is after the media generally, and the government in particular, in health and education, have been pushing an atheistic secularist worldview.</p>
<p><strong>Augustine of Hippo</strong></p>
<p>So with this biblical and historical background, what is the classical Christian doctrine regarding lying? Answer: it comes from Augustine, an early church theologian and bishop. And it was strict. These are his words:</p>
<blockquote><div>every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive. Now it is evident that speech was given to man, not that men might therewith deceive one another, but that one man might make known his thoughts to another. To use speech, then, for the purpose of deception, and not for its appointed end, is a sin. Nor are we to suppose that there is any lie that is not a sin, because it is sometimes possible, by telling a lie, to do service to another.</div></blockquote>
<p>However, there were a few, like Jerome in the early church, who thought there were exceptions to save lives – a lie "is sometimes possible". People, then and since, have pointed to Old Testament examples like the prostitute Rahab hiding the Israelite spies in her roof and lying to protect them (Jos 2.4-6, cf Heb 11.31). However, John Wesley wrote this in support of Augustine:</p>
<blockquote><div>If any, in fact, do this – either teach men to do evil that good may come or do so themselves, their damnation is just. This is particularly applicable to those who tell lies in order to do good thereby. It follows, that officious lies, as well as all others, are an abomination to the God of Truth. Therefore, there is no absurdity, however strange it may sound, in that saying of the ancient Father, 'I would not tell a sinful lie to save the souls of the whole world'.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Corrie ten Boom</strong></p>
<p>This was also the view of the 18th century, philosopher Kant. It was also the view during World War II of Corrie ten Boom's sister Nollie. Corrie ten Boom and her two sisters, Betsie and Nollie were remarkable women. They helped in the Dutch resistance movement protect Jews from the occupying Nazis. Both Corrie and Betsie ended up in Ravensbruck concentration camp, but not Nollie. Unlike her sister Nollie, Corrie believed it was right to lie to help the cause. She tells us in her book <em>The Hiding Place</em> that the first time she did so was lying over the possession of radios. She wrote: "I had known from childhood that the earth opened and the heavens rained fire upon liars … But only as I walked out of the building <em>[where she was being interrogated]</em> did I begin to tremble. Not because for the first time in my life I had told a conscious lie. But because it had been so dreadfully easy." Nollie, however, had amazing experiences of God's protection as recorded by Corrie when, against the odds, she told the truth.</p>
<p>Augustine knew of these problem cases. He knew his Old Testament, where deception seemed to achieve good results. He denied, however, that there was such a thing as justifiable falsehood. True, he argued that some lies are worse than others. He had, in fact, an eightfold distinction worked out, with the worst being lies in teaching about God and the least being lies that do no harm but seem to help someone:</p>
<blockquote><div>It cannot be denied that they have attained a very high standard of goodness who never lie except to save a man from injury; but in the case of men who have reached this standard, it is not the deceit, but their good intention that is justly praised, and sometimes even rewarded. It is quite enough that the deception should be pardoned, without its being made an object of laudation.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Interesting change</strong></p>
<p>The "new" Roman Catholic Catechism that came out in 1994 included this sentence: "To lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead <em>into error someone who has the right to know the truth.</em>" However, the 1999 "Definitive Edition" (revised) reads in an Augustinian manner: "To lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error." That has omitted the qualification (in italics above). I am sure that is right. Augustine knew that if a good person does lie in an impossible situation, it is not to be seen as a "right action". Rather the whole situation is to be seen as a tragedy. The person should feel guilty, if they lie to save the life of another. But God will forgive the lie, if there is repentance. Augustine thought as he did because he had a clear belief that this life is not all there is. Heaven and hell await. He knew that death kills the body, but lying kills the soul. He argued, therefore, that to lie to save the life of another is a foolish bargain: "Therefore, does he not speak most perversely who says that one person ought to die spiritually so that another may live corporally?" Also Augustine believed in the sovereignty of God. To lie in the hope of helping another presupposes that you are right and there is no other way out.</p>
<p>Nor was it an academic exercise for Augustine. Many of the early Christians were given the opportunity to lie to save their <em>own</em> lives. The question the authorities asked them was: "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" If they admitted it, they were martyred, often cruelly. If they said, "No!" they were freed. Should they tell or act a lie? Some did. Many did not. They refused to give in to Caesar and the enemies of Jesus. Through their commitment to the truth, the Christian world has enjoyed a culture of truth for centuries. In time this has allowed much to develop and evolve in the West in terms of scientific achievement and democratic institutions. These can only work on a basis of truthfulness.</p>
<p>How, therefore, we need to witness to the truth as it is in Jesus, if we are not to see this legacy unravel because of a new secular tradition of lying.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Stress, the Sower, Secularism and the Sabbath">(December 2018) Stress, the Sower, Secularism and the Sabbath</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2018</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Stress in the 21st century</strong></p>
<p>The recent YouGov poll from the Mental Health Foundation, with a sample size of 4,619 (the largest known study of stress levels in the UK), found the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>1) in the past year, 74% of people have felt so stressed they have been overwhelmed or unable to cope. 30% of older people reported never feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope in the past year, compared to 7% of young adults. 2) 46% reported that they ate too much or ate unhealthily due to stress. 29% reported that they started drinking or increased their drinking, and 16% reported that they started smoking or increased their smoking. 3) 51% of adults who felt stressed reported feeling depressed and 61% reported feeling anxious. 4) Of the people who said they had felt stress at some point in their lives, 16% had self-harmed and 32% said they had had suicidal thoughts and feelings. 5) 37% of adults who reported feeling stressed reported feeling lonely as a result.</div></blockquote>
<p>So what are some causes of this stress? Well, according to the poll they were varied. A friend/relative's long-term health condition, debt, needing to respond to messages instantly, comparing themselves to others, comfort with their appearance and body image, housing worries, and pressure to succeed were all cited.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Sower</strong></p>
<p>But what did (and does) Jesus say about stress? Was he concerned for people with stress, and, then, its cause and consequence? Certainly! For example, on one occasion he highlighted a certain form of stress as a factor as to why sometimes his message did not have a positive effect in people's lives and through them other people's lives. There was no "fruit", as he put it, from his teaching. This was, as many know, in his <em>Parable of the Sower</em> (and the seeds and the soils).</p>
<p>In that parable he addresses a stress that can easily paralyse us spiritually unless we are very careful. This stress, he says, means that people are not like those people for whom his message has no effect at all. Nor are they like those for whom the effect is short lived. No! Rather they are like "seeds" that had fallen "among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them [i.e. <em>the seeds when they had taken root</em>]" (Matthew 13.3). Let me quote Jesus' precise application of the seeds and their four different types of soil (or lack of it) referred to in his parable:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Hear then the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty" (Matthew 13.18-23).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And in the original the word translated "cares" is the word used for "anxious thought" – so implying anxiety or worry.</p>
<p><strong>Secularization and "the cares of the world"</strong></p>
<p>If we are honest, most of us are subject to some of those stresses and causes outlined by the Mental Health Foundation to a greater or lesser degree. But we need to understand what is going on. We need to consider what is a fundamental background cause for modern stress. For in part, some (if not most) stress in the 21st century in modern Western societies is due or related to the process of secularization. But what is "secularization"? Os Guiness defines it as:</p>
<blockquote><div>a process through which, starting from the centre and moving outward, successive sectors of society and culture have been freed from the decisive influence of religious ideas and institutions.</div></blockquote>
<p>Secularization means that references to God and his kingdom have less and less of a place in public life. So secularization forces us to spend too much time and energy on "the cares of the world". But, of course, many of the things we have to worry about are not inherently bad. It is just that there are more and more of them! Therefore, we have less discretionary time for the things of God and his kingdom. Then little by little we can easily change our focus from God to the world and allow our "cares" to take over our lives and they "choke the word, and it proves unfruitful". That then subtly increases this insidious process of secularization. Craig Gay (of Regent College, Vancouver) in his article <em>The Worries of this life</em>, <em>the Deceitfulness of Wealth and Secularization in Modern Society</em> argues (in summary) that this process renders us more …</p>
<blockquote><div>… uniquely susceptible to being deceived in the manner that Jesus suggests … The challenge of secularization in contemporary society may not lie so much in the direct threat secularity poses to religious faith as in the subtle and indirect distraction and diversion of religious faith toward things that ultimately do not matter very much. Thus while the temptation to locate our hopes and aspirations in the wrong places is not new, the process of secularization provides exceptionally strong socio-structural support for focusing our spiritual energies on temporal rather than eternal matters.</div></blockquote>
<p>So our priorities, energy and devotion regarding temporal things becomes like a religion. For some it <em>is</em> their "religion". But as secularization forces us to have a greater focus on "the cares of the world", the secular environment encourages us to think that more money will solve our worldly problems when only sometimes does it do so. So we steward badly such riches as we have. Such is "the deceitfulness of riches" that Jesus especially links with "the cares of the world."</p>
<p><strong>"The deceitfulness of riches"</strong></p>
<p>Gay also makes the point that when the worries of this life are "pursued with something approaching religious intensity … we hardly even realise how thoroughly our spiritual energies have at first been distracted and then finally co-opted by 'this world'." The problem then is "technological affluence". Such "affluence" affects nearly all of us in the West. For most of us do not consider ourselves "wealthy". So we "make the tacit assumption we must be immune to the kind of deceit mentioned in Jesus' parable." But what is affluence?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<blockquote><div>the ability to control the environment and to realise our projects and aspirations in the face of various kinds of impediments to them? Along this line, we would do well to recall that even the lowliest member of the middle class today possesses a greater ability to control critical elements of his or her own environment than the wealthiest of citizens in Jesus' day.</div></blockquote>
<p>The wonders of technology provide us with modern medicine, fast air, rail and road transport and (in the West) amazing food supplies. But then technological affluence leads to all human problems being treated as lending themselves "at least in principle, to humanly calculated solutions." As Peter Berger comments:</p>
<blockquote><div>there is the assumption that all human problems can be converted into technical problems, and if the techniques to solve certain problems do not as yet exist, then they will have to be invented. The world becomes ever more 'makeable'. This view of the world is essentially that of the engineer. First expressed in engineering proper, in the systematic manipulation of nature and of machines, it is carried over into multiple forms of social engineering (including politics), and finally into engineering approaches to the most intimate areas of interpersonal experience (including psychology, qua the engineering of the self).</div></blockquote>
<p>The human condition is seen as a problem that is up to human beings to solve. So in all sorts of ways, modern technology makes it increasingly plausible for us to locate <em>all</em> of our hopes and aspirations in "this world" as opposed to "the world to come". But as many of our problems are moral and spiritual, how foolish that is!</p>
<p><strong>The Sabbath Principle</strong></p>
<p>Craig Gay believes a recovery of the Sabbath Principle is essential for dealing with stress. So one day per week, as much as possible, is to be enjoyably celebrated society wide, for the Lord for rest, worship, godly learning, godly reflection and a godly response to "the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches". But Europe for a long time, and Britain more recently, has lost this provision. That, however, needs another <em>Coloured Supplement.</em></p>                    <hr><h2 id="Brexit, Background and the Bible (Part 1)">(January 2019) Brexit, Background and the Bible (Part 1)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2019</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Winston Churchill's vision</strong></p>
<p>On 19 September 1946 at the University of Zurich, soon after the end of the Second World War, Winston Churchill, said the following:</p>
<blockquote><div>I wish to speak to you to-day about the tragedy of Europe. This noble continent comprising on the whole the fairest and the most cultivated regions of the earth, enjoying a temperate and equable climate, is the home of all the great parent races of the western world. It is the fountain of Christian faith and Christian ethics. It is the origin of most of the culture, arts, philosophy and science both of ancient and modern times. If Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance, there would be no limit to the happiness, to the prosperity and glory which its three or four hundred million people would enjoy. Yet it is from Europe that have sprung that series of frightful nationalistic quarrels, originated by the Teutonic nations, which we have seen even in this twentieth century and in our own lifetime, wreck the peace and mar the prospects of all mankind … Yet all the while there is a remedy which, if it were generally and spontaneously adopted, would as if by a miracle transform the whole scene, and would in a few years make all Europe, or the greater part of it, as free and as happy as Switzerland is to-day. What is this sovereign remedy? It is to re-create the European family, or as much of it as we can, and provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom. We must build a kind of United States of Europe.</div></blockquote>
<p>So spoke a man with huge moral influence having done, under God, as much as any other individual to save the freedom loving world from the evil tyranny of Hitler. And there was much sense in what he said. But fundamental to what he said was this:</p>
<blockquote><div>It <em>[Europe]</em> is <em>the fountain of Christian faith and Christian ethics</em>. It is the origin of most of the culture, arts, philosophy and science both of ancient and modern times. If Europe were once united <em>in the sharing of its common inheritance</em>, there would be no limit to the happiness, to the prosperity and glory which its three or four hundred million people would enjoy.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jean Monet</strong></p>
<p>Many agreed with Churchill's vision for a United States of Europe. And this was not only, in the words of the English evangelical Christian promoter of European unity, Sir Fred Catherwood: "to create peace in place of Europe's terrible tribal wars, the last two of which cost 50 million dead". No! For it was also, as for Churchill, positively inspired by Europe's Christian roots. Jean Monnet, the great architect of modern Europe, quite publicly expressed his motivation for establishing a new European order as resulting from his admiration for the glories of the old Holy Roman Empire. Others shared that motivation at the same time as they supported the idea of a "United States of Europe" for the goal of economic recovery. After the destruction and dislocation of the Second World War, they saw the economic benefit of such recovery as contributing to a peace that together with a renewed Christian worldview would protect Churchill's common inheritance of Christian faith and Christian ethics. In turn that would undergird and ground those liberal values that had been necessary for the positive achievements of the West that were the envy of many in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>However, years later, key members of the European Union (as we now have it) have been systematically deconstructing that faith and those ethics. In the many discussions prior to the latest EU Treaty, the Lisbon Treaty, which now defines the European Union, there was an adamant refusal of the proposal by Italy …</p>
<blockquote><div>… to recognize a 'historical truth' and refer explicitly to the 'Christian Roots of Europe' in its new constitution … The preamble of the current draft treaty, drawn up by the former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's convention, refers only to the <em>cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe</em>. Specifically mentioning Christianity or God was considered too controversial in the face of furious opposition from secular France and Protestant northerners such as Sweden and Denmark. Opponents argued it would be wrong to exclude Muslims and Jews, and would therefore be better to avoid any religious reference … <em>Mr Straw, aware of the feelings of British Muslims, told reporters that if there was a reference to one religious tradition, 'we would have to make reference to others'" (The Guardian</em> 24 May 2004).</div></blockquote>
<p>And d'Estaing won. So the European Union, that Britain has now voted to leave, has a Constitution (as amended by the Lisbon Treaty and containing 339 pages and presented to the UK Parliament in January 2008) that says the following in its opening introduction:</p>
<blockquote><div>RESOLVED to mark <em>a new stage in the process of European integration</em> undertaken with the establishment of the European Communities.DRAWING INSPIRATION <em>from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe</em>, from which have developed the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law.RECALLING the historic importance of the ending of the division of the European continent and the need to create firm bases for the construction of the future Europe.CONFIRMING their attachment to the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the rule of law.</div></blockquote>
<p>So this is unashamedly, as the first words tell us, a new stage towards closer union and all part of Jean Monnet's strategy of union by a slow and steady process. For he wrote in 1952 to Robert Schuman, the founder of the European Coal and Steel Community: "Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity."</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs</strong></p>
<p>But more importantly Churchill's heritage of "Christian faith and ethics" has been vetoed in favour of Europe's "<em>cultural, religious and humanist inheritance</em>". This, however, means, that, with no grounding in the Christian faith, the definition of "the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law" is "nebulous" (to use an adjective from the Brexit debate). The meaning of "religious" is now certainly nebulous. For a start, France's "religious inheritance" includes that infamous occasion when in 1793 in the Cathedral of Notre Dame there was a "Festival of Liberty and Reason". It featured in the nave an improvised mountain. On its top was a small Greek temple dedicated "To Philosophy". The high point of the ritual was when, out of the temple, appeared an actress of the Paris Opera, dressed in red, white and blue personifying Liberty. The congregation then stretched out their hands to her and sang a pagan hymn: "Come, holy Liberty, inhabit this temple, become the goddess of the French people." But such liberty as an absolute value means licence! Not surprisingly this religion didn't last long. However, it marked the beginnings of the more subtle religion of modern secular humanism. But not only is the term "religious" now nebulous, so also are "democracy" and the "rule of law". For Hitler could claim democratic election; and why should the meaning of the "rule of law" be that of the mainstream Western tradition and not Sharia?</p>
<p>But what is the alternative to Europeanization? Since the Second World War, there has been a genuine fear of xenophobic Nazi-style nationalism. It is easy to criticize Europe as it now is. But how can we prevent, in the next generation "that series of frightful nationalistic quarrels" that have emerged in my lifetime and against which Churchill fought? Surely, there has to be a significant return to those Christian roots, for which we must pray and work. For both internationalism and nationalism are necessary, but in their debased forms both can be demonic as Revelation 13 teaches. As we shall see in Part 2 the Bible has a vision for a fully international community in heaven, but with national distinctives being part of its joy. Yes, both internationalism and nationalism can be blessed by God. As has been well pointed out, Pentecost was nationalistic in the sense that Peter and his colleagues didn't preach in Esperanto. The miracle was that "each one was hearing them speak in his own language" (Acts 2.6)!</p>
<p>So the new community, the Church of Christ, that began that first Pentecost, accepted national differences but within an international community from day one. Luke tells us (presumably from Church records) there were at least present, "Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians" (Acts 2.9-11). Part 2, therefore, will try to suggest how the Bible helps with our thinking about this tension between, nationalism and internationalism, communitarianism and cosmopolitanism, populism and globalism or however you like to describe it. It certainly doesn't base everything on economics!</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Brexit, Background and the Bible (Part 2)">(February 2019) Brexit, Background and the Bible (Part 2)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2019</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Bible's view</strong></p>
<p>What is the Bible's view of the issues behind nationalism and internationalism (or populism and globalism or however you define the tension that is behind the two sides of the debate regarding Europe)? The answer has to start at the national level and with the biblical concept of the "nation".</p>
<p>We begin with Genesis where the actual division of the world into nations and empires was seen as historically progressive. Unlike marriage itself in Genesis 1 and 2, the nation as such and fully formed is not part of the Creation before the Fall. However, like the family, the nation is implied in the first command for the primeval human pair: "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth" (Gen 1.28). The realization of both the family "be fruitful" and the nation "multiply and fill the earth" could not be achieved immediately but only after the Fall in Genesis 3. But the command is clear. It is not to stay put, enjoying Eden as a couple, but bear children and move out across the world. So we see the start of "the family" soon in Genesis 4. And later in Genesis 10 we meet the evolution of the family into nations as part of God's providential ordering of human communal life on earth. For after the Flood humanity becomes not one homogenous multitude. It is reconstituted into different nations distinguished by land (or place), language, clan and, finally, nation (Genesis 10.5,20,31). And the last words of chapter 10 are: "These are the clans of Noah … in their nations and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood" (Gen 10.32).</p>
<p>However, the very next words in chapter 11 (complementing chapter 10) are:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there … they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth'" (Gen 11.1ff).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>This reveals the sin of pride in thinking glory and power through unity is better than God's plan for being dispersed. And it reveals the sin of disobeying that plan in not being willing to be dispersed for the common good through human communities and embryonic nations. And the people suffered. For instead of one language, Gen 11.1 says: "there the Lord confused the language of all the earth [destroying this godless unity]. And then from there [Babel] the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth" (Gen 11.9). So the Tower of Babel provides us with evidence of God's judgment and mercy. Judgment in causing language barriers and mercy in forcing migration for establishing nations for communal benefit. But, then Genesis chapter 12 tells how God's plan for world salvation following the Fall is worked out through the agency of the nation as well as individuals. For God calls Abraham, and his first promise is, "I will make of you a great nation, and … in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed" (Gen 11.2-3).</p>
<p><strong>Paul and John</strong></p>
<p>What, then, can we learn from the New Testament? Among other things there is Paul's teaching at Athens (Acts 17.26), where he told "the men of Athens" on the Areopagus:</p>
<blockquote><div>the God who made the world and everything in it … made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place.</div></blockquote>
<p>This divine "determination" seems to explain why in heaven national distinctives will survive, and where necessary be redeemed as John shows in Revelation (Rev 7.9; 15.3; 15.4; 21.24; 21.26; 22.2). The nation is not just God's remedy for fallen man to restrain human evil. It is also to promote what is good (Rom 13.3-4). And there is a suggestion that God's plan for nations was a positive plan from before the Fall: "God … made of one man … having determined [past tense] allotted periods and boundaries." Certainly Paul says the establishment of the nations was so "that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel their way towards him and find him" (Acts 17.27). God is clearly sovereign over the evolution of nations. Through his providential working he sets the nation as the context in which men and women can search for God. It is not surprising, therefore, that the famous Russian author, Solzhenitsyn, said in his Noble Prize lecture:</p>
<blockquote><div>the disappearance of nations would impoverish us no less than if all people were made alike, with one character, one face. Nations are the wealth of mankind, they are its generalized personalities; the smallest of them has its own particular colours, and embodies a particular facet of God's design.</div></blockquote>
<p>This was said in the context of Lenin's famous remark:</p>
<blockquote><div>Socialism's aim is not only to abolish the fragmentation of humanity into small states and to end all distinctions between nations, not only to bring nations together, but to bring about their fusion.</div></blockquote>
<p>That, of course, was a utopian challenge to God's judgment at Babel. But as O.R.Johnston (former Church Warden of JPC) writes in his <em>Nationhood: towards a Christian Perspective</em>, yes, there will be, one day, a bringing of nations together not for "fusion" but first for judgment (this is before any glory and honour):</p>
<blockquote><div>It is remarkable that at the consummation of all things, our Lord Jesus Christ sees 'all nations' arraigned before the glorious throne of judgment and separation (Matt 25.32). And beyond that, the vision of John is not that of a city of identical inhabitants, but rather a richly variegated community lit by the Lamb and the glory of God – 'by its light shall the nations walk; and the kings of the earth shall bring into it the glory and the honour of the nations' (Revelation 21.24,26). The ultimate destiny of the faults and weaknesses of each nation is perhaps hinted at in the final chapter where the leaves of the Tree of Life are seen to be 'for the healing of the nations'" (Rev 22.2).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Practical politics</strong></p>
<p>But that final judgment of the nations reveals, as does the book of Revelation, the demonic nature of some nations. "Babel", of course, relates to Babylon. And because of Babylon's subsequent history, it becomes synonymous with any nation like Babylon (Revelation 17-18). So it stands for any godless nation or empire from those of some Roman Emperors in the days of the early Church to Hitler, Stalin and their successors in the modern era. The nation as well as international communities, such as the Roman empire, can be good or bad. So how do we respond? Luke Bretherton in his article, <em>Valuing the Nation: Nationalism and Cosmopolitanism in Theological Perspective</em> quotes Augustine (AD354-430) in his <em>City of God</em> where his …</p>
<blockquote><div>… theo-political vision is a Christian cosmopolitanism wherein humanity is one but properly differentiated into particular polities that, while sinful and orientated in on themselves, find their fulfilment beyond themselves in a universal communion with God. Such a view is found consistently throughout the Christian tradition.</div></blockquote>
<p>Certainly the ultimate international community is that of the …</p>
<blockquote><div><em>… ransomed [by the blood of Christ] people of God from every tribe and language and people and nation … made … a kingdom and priests to our God" (Rev 5.9-10).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>This began at Pentecost after the death and Resurrection of Jesus and will be fully realized when he returns. So we should be neither utopian about the nation nor about any international body. However, it seems our first responsibility, this side of heaven, is to the nation. Failing nations are not good at internationalism! But the Christian is told also to "strive for peace with everyone." However, that goes on, "and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord" (Heb 12.14). It is not for peace at any price, but for godly international relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, finally, let me conclude with something I wrote in the year 2000. "Jesus lived under the first Roman Empire, the first extended Europe. The New Testament reveals an ambivalent attitude to the Roman Empire of the first century. Clearly Paul used the Roman Empire for evangelism – its roads and cities, its structures and peace helped the gospel go forward. But Rome was also demonic. Both minor and major persecutions took place, and there was much violence. That, surely, is important for the question of how we should respond to Europe now. Europe provides possibilities. It is also dangerous. Therefore, we need to be "as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves" (Matthew 10.16). We need to analyse the situation carefully and to make wise political judgments – which will be the least worse options in many cases – and then we need to evangelize. Ultimately Europe's needs will only be met by the gospel. Pentecost reversed Babel not by setting up new political structures but by the Holy Spirit convicting men and women of the truth about Jesus and his Resurrection and calling them to repentance through the preaching of the gospel and then obeying his commission to disciple the nations. A European Mission is still more important than a European Union" (from Church and State in the New Millenium p79).</p>
<p>And that is why, at this time, the Bible's most important teaching for us concerning Brexit is Paul's command to Timothy that we should pray …</p>
<blockquote><div><em>… for all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2.2).</em></div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Pride, Humility and God">(March 2019) Pride, Humility and God</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>March 2019</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>The following is from a paper by the late John Stott in a collection </em>Alive to God<em> for James Houston, the founder of Trinity College, Vancouver. The paper has been much abridged and edited by David Holloway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pride and Humility</strong></p>
<p>Richard Baxter (1615-1691), following Jesus' spiritual ideal of being like "a little child", wrote: "humility is not a mere ornament of a Christian, but an essential part of the new nature." How that contrasts with the more modern power philosophy of Nietzsche whose hero was the Übermensch - tough, brash, masculine and overbearing and who would become a "Lord of the Earth." There is no possibility of finding a compromise between these alternative models; we are obliged to choose.</p>
<p>Pride is more than the first of the seven deadly sins. It is itself the essence of all sin. For it is the stubborn refusal to let God be God, with the corresponding ambition to take his place. It is the attempt to dethrone God and enthrone ourselves. Sin is self-deification. But God says that since he is God and he alone, he will not share his glory with any other (e.g Is 42.8).</p>
<p>Humility, then, is not a synonym for hypocrisy, pretending to be other than we are. The real hypocrisy is pride, the pretence that we can manage without God or we can rival God. Humility is honesty, acknowledging the truth about ourselves, that as creatures we depend on our Creator's power and as sinners on our Saviour's grace. Only God depends for himself on himself. His eternal self-dependence is the ultimate reality in which humility rejoices and against which pride rebels.</p>
<p><strong>World History and Pride</strong></p>
<p>The ancient Greeks had a saying that those whom the gods would destroy "they first make mad." That particular madness was hubris, a combination of arrogance and insolence. The biblical equivalent is saying "pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall" (Pro 16.18); and Scripture provides numerous illustrations of this principle. Since God alone is able truthfully to declare, "I am the Lord, and there is no other" (Is. 45.6), it is intolerable that any nation or individual should presume to make these words their own as Assyria did (Zeph 2.15) and later Babylon (Is 47.8). Any human claim to be God constitutes such an offence against reality. Indeed, God cannot condone such a monumental lie or even allow it to remain unchallenged. Israel and Judah, God's people, were tiny kingdoms squashed between the successive empires of Assyria, Babylonia and Persia to the north east and of Egypt to the south-west. And God used these pagan nations to invade and subjugate his people, as the prophets explained, for punishment and discipline. But when these nations became proud of their successes, he discarded them and they, too, were laid low.</p>
<p>It has been the same throughout the history of the world. All tyranny is dreadful while it lasts; but it does not last. Wickedness flourishes for a while, but then withers. Evil empires rise, but then they fall. Hitler boasted that his Third Reich would continue for 1000 years; it lasted exactly twelve years, three months and two days. And if not all such proud persons or groups are humbled during their lifetime, they will certainly be brought low on the Day of Judgment. For on that day, all the veils of illusion will be stripped from us; idols will be exposed in their falsehood; and the living God will be revealed in his truth. In that blinding moment of reality, all people of all times and places will acknowledge that God is God, and human arrogance will be seen for the empty puff of vanity that it is:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>the arrogance of man will be brought low, and the pride of men humbled; the Lord alone will be </em>exulted<em> in that day" (Is 2.17).</em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Salvation history</strong></p>
<p>Within the general history of the world, over which the sovereign Lord presides, whether people acknowledge him or not, he has been working out a particular history of salvation. It began with the covenant he made with Abraham and renewed with Israel, and which culminated in Christ and the new community of Christ. In world history, as God of the creation, he has been active in the life of the nations. In salvation history, as God of the covenant, he has been especially active in the life of his people Israel.</p>
<p>In both histories the same double epigram has operated, that God humbles those who exalt themselves and exults those who humble themselves. In world history, however, the negative aspect has prevailed: God has brought low the pride of those who have refused to acknowledge him as God. In salvation history, by contrast, the epigram's positive aspect has predominated. God has delighted to exalt those who have humbled themselves before him. Indeed, he has disclosed himself in these terms – Psalm 113.5-8:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Who is like the Lord our God, who is seated on high, who looks far down on the heavens and the earth? He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>In other words, this is the kind of God he is. At the same time, and in consequence, he tells us the kind of people he wants us to be. He wants us "to walk humbly" with our God (Mic 6.8). Humility is to be an essential characteristic of his redeemed people. Of course, we need to consider God's own humility of mind and action. We are told that Christ Jesus, who shared eternally in the very nature of God, did not regard this equality with God as a prize or privilege to be selfishly enjoyed. Rather taking the very nature of a servant he "emptied himself" of his glory and "humbled himself' to serve. He fed the hungry and healed the sick. He fraternized with the dropouts of Palestinian society. He even donned a slave's apron and washed his apostles' feet. And the final stage of his self-humiliation was to become obedient to death, even to death by crucifixion. Therefore, because he had thus humbled himself to the depths, God exalted him to the heights, giving him the highest rank, in order that every knee should bow to him and every tongue confess him Lord (Phil 2.6-11).</p>
<p><strong>Personal history</strong></p>
<p>In his public teaching ministry Jesus commended humility as the pre-eminent characteristic of the citizens of God's kingdom, and went on to describe it as the humility of a child (Mt 18.2-4):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them and said, "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Many people are puzzled by this teaching, since children are seldom humble in either character or conduct. Jesus must therefore have been alluding to their humility of status, not behaviour. Children are rightfully called "dependents." They depend on their parents for everything. For what they know, they depend on what they have been taught; and for what they have, they depend on what they have been given. As we shall see, these two areas are, in fact, the very ones Jesus specifies when he develops the model of a child's humility.</p>
<p>In our thinking, we are to be adults not children, putting our God-given intellectual powers to their fullest use (1 Cor 14.20). Nevertheless, in the process of learning, we are to be like children. Jesus thanked his Father that he had "hidden these things from the wise and understanding" and had instead "revealed them to little children" (Mt 11.25). What he was rejecting was not, of course, wisdom and learning in themselves, but rather pride of intellect and trust in autonomous reason. Similarly, what he was advocating was neither ignorance nor irrationality, but rather humility before God's self-revelation in Christ. Christian humility begins with an open-minded readiness to listen to God and submit to his revelation. Childlike humility is to be expressed not only in an open mind (the way we learn what is taught us), but also in an open hand (the way we receive what is offered us). Jesus stressed this in relation to the kingdom: "Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it" (Mk 10.15). In other words, the kingdom (a synonym for salvation) is a free gift to be received - no merit can earn it, or even contribute to it.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Empty Tomb">(April 2019) The Empty Tomb</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2019</li><li>Apologetics</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Resurrection and skeptical views</strong></p>
<p>The New Testament doctrine of the Resurrection, not a post-modern reconstruction of it, lies at the heart of the Christian faith:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10.9).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>But was this not just a "spiritual" resurrection of Jesus rather than a "physical" resurrection? Of course the Resurrection of Jesus was not a crude resuscitation of a corpse; it was a glorious transformation. In that sense his old "flesh and blood" (to use Paul's phrase) did not inherit the new order of "the Kingdom of God" (1 Corinthians 15.50). But what Paul implies and the New Testament elsewhere makes quite clear is that on the first Easter morning Jesus' tomb was found empty; and it was found empty because Jesus had risen. To suggest that it does not matter if the bones of Jesus are still in the soil of Palestine is clearly contrary to the plain meaning of the texts and is, therefore, dangerous heresy and needs to be opposed.</p>
<p>People who still want to use the language of "resurrection" while denying the empty tomb have to say that the empty tomb is a myth. That is to say, they present it as a story concocted to illustrate the meaning of the word "resurrection". But that is not what the Bible teaches. According to the text of the Bible, the empty tomb is clearly not just an illustration of the meaning of the Resurrection; it is evidence for the Resurrection. Any liberal theology denying that, is not the position of the Christian Church down the centuries. It is not the faith that countless men and women have lived and died for. They knew that had the tomb not been empty everything that they affirmed would have been falsified. If Jesus' remains had still been in the tomb, only the extremes of Gnosticism could have believed that death had lost its sting and the grave had lost its victory.</p>
<p><strong>The New Testament</strong></p>
<p>How, though, can we be sure that the tomb <em>was</em> empty? Is the evidence of the texts not rather weak? No! The main textual evidence for the empty tomb is there in the Gospel narratives - the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. But the argument is sometimes put forward that the Resurrection accounts are all so different and therefore cannot be reliable. What do we say to this?</p>
<p>It is true that the Resurrection narratives are different in the four Gospels. But the basic difference lies in the accounts of the appearances of Jesus to the disciples, not in the accounts of how women (and others) found the tomb of Jesus empty. It is not at all strange, in any case, that the Gospel writers have different accounts of the appearances of Jesus to his disciples. Different apostles most probably reported different appearances on different occasions. On the other hand, it is quite remarkable how similar the accounts of the empty tomb are in all four Gospels. There is an amazing unanimity. The three Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) all agree on three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>that some women, including Mary Magdalene, went to the tomb of Jesus on the first day of the week and found the stone rolled away from the tomb's entrance;</li>
<li>that a young man (or some angelic presence) explained what had happened, saying, "He is risen, he is not here";</li>
<li>that the women were frightened and left the tomb.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we look at John 20.1-2, we find that the fourth Gospel also fits in with this outline. The only difference there is that the angelic interpreter has not been mentioned - but two angels are mentioned in verses 11-13, when Mary is back at the tomb. It is quite clear that the Gospel writers were drawing on different sources and different accounts of the Resurrection, but <em>these sources all agree over the empty tomb</em>. Mark's Gospel is generally reckoned to be written in the 60s of the first century AD. But the information he (and the others) drew on was preached, remembered and probably recorded much earlier. As late as AD 56 when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians, we are told that many of the disciples who had seen Jesus after the Resurrection "are still alive" (1 Corinthians 15.6). It is unthinkable that any eyewitnesses would have allowed an empty tomb tradition to develop so uniformly if it was fiction.</p>
<p>Paul, however, as someone is bound to point out, does not mention the empty tomb. True, but he implies it. In 1 Corinthians 15.3 he speaks about the basic core of the Gospel:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>that Christ died ... that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day ... and that he appeared </em>[to various disciples]<em>.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>This early "creed" thus focused on the burial as well as the death of Christ. As Professor F.F. Bruce says:</p>
<blockquote><div>Burial emphasizes the reality of the Resurrection which followed, as a divine act which reversed the act of men.</div></blockquote>
<p>It points to the empty tomb. We have to say that what was raised was what was buried - i.e. the body of Jesus. Note, also, that Paul specifies that the Resurrection happened on the "third day". What could give rise to this specific date except the discovery of the empty tomb? Had there been no empty tomb but only visionary experiences, there would be no possible reason for such an emphasis on the "third day".</p>
<p>More importantly, this "basic core'" or "creed" of belief made it clear that Christians believed and must still believe <em>both</em> "that he was raised on the third day" <em>and</em> "that he appeared". The appearances by themselves are not the gospel or good news. Some of the early disciples thought they were just having a psychic experience (Luke 24.37). But together with the empty tomb - a resurrection that reversed the burial - the appearances pointed to the true nature of Jesus' Resurrection: it was a "bodily" resurrection. Certainly, in 1 Corinthians 15.51, Paul presupposes "bodily change": "We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed." He may not explicitly have mentioned the empty tomb - instead he took it for granted, as any Jew would have done in talk of "resurrection". Unlike the Greeks, the Jews did not see a person as a soul entrapped in a body awaiting release at death. Rather, they saw a person more as "body and soul" together. The great hope then was for a resurrection that included the body.</p>
<p>There are two further questions we must ask over the empty tomb. <em>First</em>, a very simple question: Why did the Jewish authorities never produce the remains of Christ to silence the Christian movement once and for all, if in fact Christ's body was still in the tomb or had been removed? The only explanation which has maintained its credibility over the centuries is that there was no body for them to produce, because of Jesus' bodily Resurrection.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, if the Resurrection does <em>not</em> encompass the transformation of the physical body, what do we say in the final analysis about this material universe? What ultimately happens to this universe of space and time? Is it all just some great mistake that God tries to forget? That was the Gnostic heresy - to say "matter is bad or mistaken".</p>
<p>John Polkinghorne, formerly Professor of Mathematical Physics at Cambridge, then ordained and then President of Queens' College, Cambridge, says, "No! It is not a mistake." And the key is the Empty Tomb. "The Empty Tomb," he writes, "says to me that matter has a destiny, a transformed and transmuted destiny, no doubt, but a destiny nevertheless. The material creation is not a transient, even mistaken episode". That was Paul's view also. He saw Christ's Resurrection as the "first fruits". Ultimately, he said, the creative power of God will transform the whole material universe:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God" (Romans 8.21).</em></div></blockquote>

                                                <p><strong>A Christian World View</strong></p>
<p>What is a Christian World View? Charles Colson and Nancy Pearcey in <em>How Now Shall We Live</em>? argue as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>the first and most fundamental element of any worldview is the way it answers the questions of origins – where the universe came from and how human life began. The second element is the way it explains the human dilemma: 'why is there war and suffering, disease and death?</div></blockquote>
<p>They then say that the problem for the Christian is that if the universe is the product of a Creator who creates what is good, why is there so much that is bad in this world? If God is not only loving, yet has resurrection power, why does he allow such evil and not intervene to call a halt? But the biblical World View does have answers which others do not have. For example, it says that we were created in God's image and need to live by his commands – our maker's instructions. And we are created as moral agents but free moral agents with the liberty to choose either good or evil. So, regarding the first humans, while in Eden with total freedom to eat from any tree, there was just one prohibition, for human good – namely against eating from "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2.9). But, those first humans, Adam and Eve, exercised their free choice by choosing to do what God had prohibited and so chose the path, ultimately, not to life but to death. Theologians call this disaster the "Fall."</p>
<p><strong>Humankind is Fallen</strong></p>
<p>All that is why the Bible says that we human beings are, often after temptation by the devil, responsible for evil. For we have inherited the disobedience of Adam and Eve who demonstrated that the choice to disobey God is infectious. For ever since then, human nature has a diseased moral sensibility. This, theologians call "Original Sin". And, indeed, such human sin affects the natural world, explaining, at its deepest level, thorns and thistles and why human work is often stressful and childbirth painful. The disobedience of our first parents has been likened to a tide that sweeps us along with it. And as Colson and Pearcey say, "the problem with this answer is not that people find it unclear but that they find it unpalatable." It makes us all involved in the sad and sorry state of our world and in the natural environment being "red in tooth and claw".</p>
<p>But as sin's infection "came into the world through one man," so the remedy comes "through the one man Jesus Christ" (Romans 5.12-21). Therefore, "if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10.9). That, however, is rejected by many.</p>
<p>The seeds of this rejection were sown with the rise of science and technology and the foolishness of believing that certain regularities in the natural world are sufficient to explain human origins and human evil. In turn that led in the late 1700s and the 1800s to the belief that all that was needed for human perfectibility and flourishing was evolution and education. "Time" itself was now believed to be redemptive and there was no such thing as sin or guilt, with nature itself being our creator not the living God.</p>
<p><strong>The problem – no longer in man but in the environment</strong></p>
<p>The world was bewitched by such new scientific knowledge, which, in context, has its place and can answer, from one perspective, how some things happen. However, such is "the madness of crowds" that during the twentieth century to ask "purpose questions" which science cannot answer, was said to be illegitimate. Had not Darwinian science, it was said, proved that the purpose of life was to survive? So no longer could questions relating to life's purpose and meaning be asked. Influential minorities in the Western World had decided they had been answered by science. For beyond survival there is no meaning, just nothingness! But humans cannot stop asking common-sense questions about purpose or live without some god to worship. And "selfism" as a default god has a short shelf-life. So new gods needed to be found - and they were (and they are still with us), namely the gods of "health", "wealth" and "pleasure".</p>
<p>However, with human sin now being said to be "a category mistake", where did human conflict and suffering came from? The new thinking said, "it is not from inside people but from outside in their environment." Jesus had said, "from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness (Mark 7.21). But it was now said, "No!" it all comes from ignorance, illness, poverty, and being unhappy. Therefore, the cry then goes up, "let us increase education and work for, first, physical and mental health; secondly, the alleviation of poverty; and, thirdly, the provision of every means for pleasure including sexual pleasure." And so laws were changed and education made to indoctrinate for social change. The result in the West is that today, except for consent, we have little morality regarding life questions (about its beginning and end) and almost none regarding human genitalia.</p>
<p><strong>The modern world</strong></p>
<p>In the 20th century such modern World Views, lacking the belief in the Second Coming of Christ, have given rise to various totalitarian "utopian" politics for a secular heaven on earth. But two World Wars and the threat of a nuclear holocaust generated a disenchantment not now with religion, but with the saving value of science and technology, except among elites with a vested interest in the secular (atheistic) status quo. It is now being recognized, however, that their basis for a World View is no longer adequate. This, in turn, has led, tragically, to a new irrationalism, on the one hand, and outside the Western world, a resurgence of traditional religions, on the other hand.</p>
<p>But Western irrationalism and the bigotry that goes with it, includes a doctrinaire egalitarianism. This prevents any rational evaluation of the various World Views to which this irrationalism and these other religions lead. For all now have to be endorsed, however much they are contradictory. Also in the last 50 years the biblical World View has been eroded in the West by ignorance and perversity. So few people are now able to make an evaluation of the splendour and sanity of the biblical World View and how it answers, more than any other, those fundamental World View questions.</p>
<p><strong>The Christian Institute and <em>Living Christianity</em></strong></p>
<p>As a first step in making the Christian World View better known, the Christian Institute has a new teaching resource. As is usual with such resources it has a DVD, together with a study guide and a larger leader's guide. I hope we can make use of this ourselves during the coming year. It is entitled <em>Living Christianity</em> and the subtitle is "following Jesus in every area of life". Its 5 studies are 1) Concern for society; 2) Christians and the world; 3) Christians and work; 4) Life, gender, marriage and family; and 5) Christians as citizens.</p>
<p>This is simple without being simplistic and does not underestimate anyone's intelligence nor overestimate their knowledge. May God use it greatly as a seed for change. As a preface to the Leader's guide there is a famous quote from a supporter of Luther. It comes from an 1864 novel about the great Reformer and says this:</p>
<blockquote><div>If I profess, with the loudest voice and the clearest exposition, every portion of the truth of God except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ, however boldly I may be professing Christianity. Where the battle rages the loyalty of the soldier is proved; and to be steady on all the battle-field besides is mere flight and disgrace to him if he flinches at that one point.</div></blockquote>
<p>My conviction is that the fundamental attack now has been, and still is, on Christ obeying, heterosexual monogamous life-long marriage and the ethics relating to it. Such a marriage is a creation ordinance and so for everyone, not just believers. So may we all pray and work for its restoration as the norm, once again, for our church and nation.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="The Ascension of Jesus Christ">(June 2019) The Ascension of Jesus Christ</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2019</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>

As Easter was late this year, it means Ascension Day comes nearly in June. Something on Christ's Ascension seemed most appropriate. For Ascension Day celebrates such a fundamental reality.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dealing with doubt</strong></p>
<p>A theological disease of silly skepticism but of extreme proportions infected many churches, Protestant and Roman Catholic, in the 1960s. Its legacy is still with us, having seriously affected the wider culture. One contributing factor was a little book written in 1963 by John Robinson, a former Bishop of Woolwich, and entitled <em>Honest to God</em>. Chapter 1 started off by seeming to deny the Ascension:</p>
<blockquote><div>Even such an educated man as St Luke can express the conviction of Christ's ascension - the conviction that he is not merely alive but reigns in the might and right of God - in the crudest of terms of being 'lifted' up into heaven, there to sit down at the right hand of the Most High" (Acts 1.9-11).</div></blockquote>
<p>But these arguments of the late Bishop of Woolwich were wrong. The New Testament writers were aware of figurative speech as much as we are. The "parables", after all, were the stuff of Jesus teaching. Nor is there real evidence in the New Testament of belief in a crude three-decker universe. Such comments on the physical universe, as we have, do not imply a belief in a structured spatial universe in which "heaven" is one part of space. In the Jewish intertestamental literature as indeed in Gnostic literature you had some such ideas. But in the New Testament there is an absence of cosmological geography. In the book of Revelation at the end of the Seven Letters to the Churches you read: "after this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, 'Come up here …' <em>At once</em> I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne" (Rev 4.1-2). There was no journeying. It was, for the writer, life in an immediate, new, spiritual order. Certainly the early Christian Fathers after the Apostolic age had no illusions. Augustine of Hippo was clear. Writing of the fact that "Christ is seated at God's right hand," he says with regard to the word "sitting": "the expression indicates not a posture of the members, but judicial power, which the majesty never fails to possess."</p>
<p>Modern man has not been the first to discover the power and value of metaphors or figurative language. Most use spatial language metaphorically to suggest value. We regularly use metaphors of space to indicate superior or inferior position. We say, "prices are up and wages are down." In football you are in the "top half" or, if you are Newcastle United, in the "bottom half" of the Premier League. Need I say more?</p>
<p><strong>The Ascension</strong></p>
<p>The early Christians, of course, did not only believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus. As they said (and we today say) in the Apostles' Creed: "I believe ... he [<em>Jesus Christ</em>] ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father." The Resurrection was wonderful. It made it clear that Christ was victorious over sin and death following his crucifixion. But even more good news is that Christ is now truly reigning and in control of everything in heaven and on earth. That is the message of the Ascension and his Session (or his being seated at the right hand of God the Father). The writer to the Hebrews, therefore, tells us to be ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and </em>is seated at the right hand<em> of the throne of God" (Heb 12.2).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>The Ascension was the last parting of the risen Christ from his disciples who had seen him alive after the Resurrection. The difference this time was in the nature of the parting. The previous description of such a parting in Luke's Gospel seems instantaneous (Luke 24.31). At the Ascension Jesus parted "as they were looking on" (Acts 1.9). The process could be observed to a certain point. A cloud came down, probably as at the Transfiguration of Jesus. That was when, together with Peter, John and James, "a cloud [<em>which had signified in the Old Testament the divine presence</em>] came and overshadowed them" (Luke 9.34). So now Jesus was drawn up into the cloud and the cloud did rise. However, while the other separations of the risen Jesus from his disciples were for a few hours or days only, this was truly final. There would be no new appearances (or none of the same kind). Never again was Jesus to be with his disciples in such a way that they could even eat with, drink with, and touch, him. This was a withdrawal of Jesus from the whole order of existence that we experience this side of the grave. It completed for Jesus that process of change from this current limited and finite state that began with his Resurrection. Jesus was, indeed, returning to his Father: "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" (John 20.17). J.I.Packer says this "withdrawal had to take place somehow; and going up, down or sideways, failing to appear or suddenly vanishing were the only possible ways. Which would signify most clearly that Jesus would henceforth be reigning in glory? That answers itself."</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, therefore, returned to his Father not in the same way as he came. He returned as the "Word" having been "made flesh" - for ever united with human nature. But the Resurrection had so affected the physical side of Christ's human nature that his body, as recorded in the Gospels, was (even before the Ascension) independent of what we would call "the laws of nature". Now with his fully glorified body we may assume the change is complete.</p>
<p><strong>The Session</strong></p>
<p>The Session - "being seated at God's right hand" - began with the Ascension and is the true and ultimate fulfilment of Psalm 110, the most quoted part of the Old Testament in the New Testament: "The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool'" (Psalm 110.1). Jesus had this Psalm in mind during the last week of his earthly ministry (Mark 12.36). The early Apostles saw its fulfilment in the Ascension. This comes out in Peter's Pentecost Sermon: "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing" (Acts 2.33). But that Psalm 110 also talks of a "priest forever": "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek'" (verse 4). The New Testament writers saw Christ's Session, involving a present priestly role, as so vital. Paul says in Romans 8.34: "Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died - more than that, who was raised – who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us." That means Christ, God the Son, is working with God the Father in our interest. He is the guarantor that what he died to secure for us will be ours. And Christ prays not as we do, often with a sense of uncertainty as to whether prayer will be positively answered. For he now has "all authority in heaven" (Matt 28.18). What he prays for is done! Jesus' "high priesthood" also encourages us to pray, with all our weaknesses:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are - yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Hebrews 4.15-16).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Finally, the use of Psalm 110 by the Apostles invites us to see Jesus Christ now as truly victorious, being "high over" everything in our universe of space and time and in the realm of an eternity that is far beyond our weakest imaginings. In the ancient world, being at the right hand meant, of course, being the chief executive of the King or Emperor. Undoubtedly there is symbolic and metaphorical language being used, but in the words of H.B.Swete:</p>
<blockquote><div>the exaltation and glorification of the sacred manhood of our Lord, the exercise by him of all authority in heaven and on earth, the certainty of his final triumph over sin and death, are facts and the most potent facts in the life of the human race.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Christ the King</strong></p>
<p>The throne imagery implies kingship. Jesus Christ is now "crowned":</p>
<blockquote><div><em>we see him </em>[Jesus]<em>, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, </em>crowned with glory and honour<em> because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone" (Heb 2.9).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>In the Parable of the Ten Minas Jesus suggested his Ascension was like being "appointed king" (Luke 19.12). Jesus told Pilate that he was "a king" (John 18.37) but that his kingdom was "not from the world". The early Christians were accused by their opponents of saying "there is another king, Jesus" (Acts 17.7).</p>
<p>As persecution increased, or was likely to increase, the more it seems believers were to focus on "the Power and Empire of Christ our Redeemer" (to quote the words of the UK Coronation Service). The book of Revelation speaks of the Ascended Christ as "the ruler of kings on earth" (Rev 1.5). We are also told that "on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords" (Rev 19.16). So when, according to Suetonius, the Emperor Domitian at Rome was wanting to be called "our Lord and God" (<em>Dominus et Deus noster</em>), it was clear the early church had to proclaim that the Ascended Christ was over any blasphemous Emperor. But were these statements of Christ's kingship the empty claims made by men and women driven to despair? "No!" said these early Christians. "For Christ exercises a real kingship at the present time in spite of all the suffering." They knew that just before his Ascension Jesus had made that amazing claim: "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matt 28.18).</p>
<p>Christ had exercised "authority" in his earlier ministry (with authority being not only the right to act but also having the necessary power). He revealed his authority to forgive sins by healing the paralytic man (Mark 2.10). He was seen to teach having "authority" (Matt 7.29). He had authority over the demonic (Mark 1.27). He delegated authority to his Apostles (Mark 6.7). And he had spiritual authority to "give eternal life" (John 17.2). What was new now was that the whole creation came within the scope of Christ's authority and power. All these previous claims to authority fall significantly short of this claim to have <em>"all authority in heaven and on earth."</em></p>
<p><strong>All authority in heaven</strong></p>
<p>Paul writes about this heavenly authority in Ephesians 1.20-22 where Christ is said now to be raised from the dead and seated at the right hand of the Father ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em> ...in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And he [God] put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church" (Eph 1.20-22).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Whatever these spiritual or eternal realities are, Christ is above them and "far above" them. Christ has a position that has no parallel in heaven. He is not the best of any angelic beings. He is the supreme Son sharing the Father's throne. So the Philippians were told (Phil 2.9-11):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Therefore God has highly exalted him to the highest place and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And "Lord" can stand for the divine name. So in heaven the Ascended Christ is praised by "thousands upon thousands" of worshipping angels:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!" (Rev 5.11-12).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>The Ascended Christ is also Lord over evil spiritual forces. The early Christians could say, as we can and must:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places" (Eph 6.12).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Christ, however, has ultimate authority over those evil forces. As yet the Devil is not finally defeated. He is "down" but not "out". One day he will be defeated. Revelation 20 speaks of "the devil ... thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever." This, too, is beyond imagining in its fearfulness. It is a warning for us of the utter seriousness of evil; but a hope that one day it will be no more. As yet these evil spiritual forces are not fully "under Christ's feet". The struggle goes on. But Christ is the ultimate victor.</p>
<p><strong>All authority on earth</strong></p>
<p>What, then, does it mean to say that the Ascended Christ has all authority on earth? We learn that already "the Son" of God is the one by whom ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities - all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things" (Col 1.16).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>But now we are told that "in him all things hold together" (Col 1.17); and "the Son," says Hebrews 1.3, "upholds the universe by the word of his power." That is not like Atlas of mythology taking the dead weight of the world on his shoulders. No! Rather the Ascended Christ is able to be a living dynamic immanence within the created universe. In his earthly ministry Christ had a unique power over nature. He did among people "works that no one else did" (John 15.24). Ascended there would seem to be no limit, now that his manhood is glorified.</p>
<p>The New Testament sees the Ascended Christ as a fulfilment of Psalm 8. He is the true fulfiller of human destiny. "Man" was made "a little lower than the heavenly beings" and everything was intended to be "in subjection to him." But "at present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus [<em>the exception, at his birth</em>] crowned with glory and honour because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone" (Heb 2.7-9). We should never be surprised by the rise of modern science and human power. But in Jesus we can now see far more than the fulfilment of all that was intended for humankind (had it not been corrupted by human sin).</p>
<p>Not only physical nature but also rebellious human nature is subject to the Ascended Christ's authority. In addition to Psalms 110 and Psalm 8, Psalm 2 was important for the early Christians. When they were first attacked by the religious authorities - "their rulers and elders and scribes" (Acts 4.5) - they immediately thought of Psalm 2 and the words of "our father David" ...</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Anointed" (Acts 4.25-26).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Psalm 2 had spoken of "the Son" having "the nations" as an "inheritance": "you shall break them with a rod or iron and dash them in pieces like potter's vessel" (verse 9). So to the Church at Thyatira, in the book of Revelation, the risen and ascended Christ says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>The one who overcomes and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father" (Rev 2.26-27).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>That was said to a church not suffering persecution but to a church, like churches today, being corrupted by a false prophetess (an ancient equivalent of "plausible" modern Lesbian bishops). She "is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality" (Rev 2.20). There is no suggestion that this side of Christ's return, any violence should be used by the Church. The rod of iron was thought to be an iron tipped rod used by shepherds (forcefully) to direct their sheep. However, the prayer of the early Christians in Acts 4 was not for any "shattering" but that the Lord would enable his "servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness" and that God would heal and perform miracles (Acts 4.29-30). That was their exercise of power!</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>But this current reign of the Ascended Christ has a time limit.</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For 'God has put all things in subjection under his feet.' But when it says, 'all things are put in subjection,' it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all" (1 Cor 15.24-28).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>This "kingdom" that "Christ hands over" is to be distinguished from the "kingdom" the Son has with the father that "will never end" when, indeed, the triune God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) is all in all. Until then there is, so to speak, this temporary break in God's plan for all eternity, caused by the reality of supernatural and human sinfulness. And Jesus Christ, now Ascended and reigning, our king and high priest, "the Lamb on the Throne" is the one to whom we can look for guidance, help, correction and forgiveness. Colossians 3.1-3 says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we should pray the Collect for Ascension Day which is this:</p>
<blockquote><div>Almighty God, as we believe your only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended into the heavens, so may we also in heart and mind thither ascend and with him continually dwell; who is alive and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="A World Revolution and Not A Shot Fired">(August 2019) A World Revolution and Not A Shot Fired</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2019</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>The former Head of Religious Broadcasting at the BBC, Colin Morris, has talked about a "revolutionary take-over of society accomplished without a shot being fired." And the local agent of the revolution, he says, "sits demurely in your sitting-room, staring at you glassy-eyed – your television set."</p>
<p>No understanding of society in Britain would be complete without reference to broadcasting; and there is no way we can talk about moral-cultural values and the place of Christianity in the Public Square without talking about how Christians and churches should relate and respond to the electronic media.</p>
<p><strong>The Revolution</strong></p>
<p>The revolution has undoubtedly been subtle. For it is not always the outrageous, the blasphemous or the overtly biased Radio and TV programmes that bring about cultural change and dislodge tried and tested values. But as David Winter, another Head of Religious Programmes BBC Radio, said: "The main impact of television is not through single programmes, however controversial or newsworthy, but through the steady trickle of attitudes, views and opinions." It is undoubtedly the case that programmes like <em>Woman's Hour</em> or <em>The World at One</em> or any of the other "safe" magazine programmes have enormous influence in legitimizing attitudes and views and thus effecting cultural change. So the electronic media have become a basic constituent in the formation of a public consciousness. Radio and TV have extended the frontiers of the Public Square or Public Forum. Currently in the United Kingdom, however, the Christian community experiences a certain exclusion, if not opposition, from the existing broadcasting establishments. But how on earth has that happened? In part it is "tale of two men" – John Reith and Hugh Greene.</p>
<p>It is not readily admitted that humanism is the creed of many in broadcasting, while Christianity is <em>passé</em>. One senior BBC drama producer said rather cynically that in broadcasting today you can be committed to anything except Christianity. Colin Morris seemed to agree with the proposition that "humanism in one form or another is probably the unacknowledged faith of the vast majority of broadcasters." David Windter said, "Secular humanists virtually ran TV drama in the sixties and early seventies." And add to that the fact that some with enormous programme or editorial control in <em>religious</em> programming need have little or no Christian allegiance. Yet when some of these same people (with views other than Christian) visit or work in Broadcasting House in London, as they walk in, they see the dedicatory inscription (in Latin). When it is translated it is found to be full of biblical and Christian allusions:</p>
<blockquote><div>This temple of the arts and muses is dedicated to Almighty God by the first Governors of Broadcasting in the year 1931, Sir John Reith being Director General. It is their prayer that good seed sown may bring forth a good harvest; that all things hostile to peace and purity may be banished from this house and that the people inclining their ear to whatsoever things are beautiful and honest and of good report may tread the path to wisdom and uprightness.</div></blockquote>
<p>Here were obviously Christian ideals. But at a certain point in time the values of the BBC changed.</p>
<p><strong>John Reith</strong></p>
<p>The founding father of British broadcasting was John Reith. An engineer and brought up in a Scottish manse, he believed in God and he believed in guidance. In October 1922 he heard a sermon at Regent Square Church on the text in Ezekiel, "Thus saith, the Lord, 'I sought a man to stand in the gap…'" That night he wrote in his diary, "I still believe there is some great work for me to do in the world." He then saw in the papers an advertisement for the job of "general manager" for a company involved in what was called "broadcasting". He applied, realized the significance of the task, was offered the job, and again wrote in his diary, "I had kept my faith alive: night and morning had comforted and encouraged myself with the words, 'Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him and He shall bring it to pass'." Here was a man who believed he had a divine destiny.</p>
<p>Morris summarizes the avowed aim of the British Broadcasting Company under Reith as "the attempt to bring the best of everything into the greatest possible number of homes." Unashamedly he gave the Christian religion prominence. "Christianity," Reith said, "happens to be the stated and official religion of the country; it is recognized by the Crown. This is a fact which those who have criticized our right to broadcast the Christian religion would do well to bear in mind…" But it was not only Reith who saw that the values of the BBC were to be Christian values. Twenty-five years later in 1948 the then Director-General, Sir William Haley, could still say this to the British Council of Churches:</p>
<blockquote><div>There are many demands of impartiality laid on the Corporation, but this [about Christian values] is not one of them. We are citizens of a Christian country and the BBC – an institution set up by the State – bases its policy upon a positive attitude towards the Christian values. It seeks to safeguard those values and to foster acceptance of them. The whole preponderant weight of its programmes is directed towards that end.</div></blockquote>
<p>But as early as 1965 "humanism" had taken over! The Director-General of the day, Sir Hugh Charlton Greene, also knew there could be no neutrality in broadcasting. But he seemed to be saying (subtly) the values were only going to be those of liberal humanism. He would not be impartial where "there are clashes for and against the basic moral values - truthfulness, justice, freedom, compassion and tolerance. Nor do I believe we should be impartial about certain things like racialism or extreme forms of political belief."</p>
<p>However, freedom (subtly) became "freedom from positive Christian values." And freedom <em>from</em> positive Christian values may look like benign tolerance; but it is not neutral. It can be the suppression of these religious values and the denial of their clear statement; often it is the positive assertion of the religion of humanism. Of course, in themselves these humanistic values cited are excellent and necessary. So is oxygen. But when you are dying of thirst it has got to combined with hydrogen. The point is this: values do not work like "half a loaf". They are more like a chemical compound. Certain combinations are necessary for them to be viable in society. But who decided that a positive attitude towards full Christian values should be replaced by a reductionist set of moral values? Hugh Greene himself, it seems.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh Greene</strong></p>
<p>Undoubtedly Greene, a very able, very shrewd, but biased man, contributed hugely to the "sixties revolution", as it is now called. He was an expert in the psychological manipulation of the media. He had masterminded the BBC's broadcasts to Nazi Germany during World War II and headed up the Psychological Warfare Department in Malaya during the post-war emergency. He was a professional. Whether you want men like that at a time when "winning back the viewers" is a priority [<em>for ITV – independently funded – had started in 1956</em>], is questionable. Not every method is legitimate. But Greene understood what made people tick. Some of the BBC creations of the Greene era were huge successes. They gave huge offence, too! Greene was the very opposite of Reith. Reith himself said so (in his diary): "Hugh and I were fundamentally in complete opposition of outlook and attitude. I lead; and he follows the crowd in all the disgusting manifestations of the age … Without any reservation he gives the public what it wants; I would not, did not, and said I wouldn't." But Reith had misjudged Greene. For Greene was trying to be ahead of public opinion. He generated permissiveness. He was a leader in the new ways. In Rome in 1965 he said this:</p>
<blockquote><div>In its search for truth, indeed in whatever it undertakes, a broadcasting organization must recognize an obligation towards tolerance and towards the maximum liberty of expression … I believe that broadcasters have a duty not to be diverted by arguments in favour of what is, in fact, disguised censorship. I believe we have a duty to take account of the changes in society, <em>to be ahead of public opinion rather than always wait upon it</em> … relevance is the key – relevance to the audience and to the tide of opinion in society. Outrage is impermissible. Shock is not always so. Provocation may be healthy and indeed socially imperative" [italics mine].</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Holiday Reading</strong></p>
<p>All the above is an excerpt, lightly edited, from a book I wrote in 1986 entitled, <em>A Nation under God</em>. I have quoted that because broadcasting issues and in particular, the BBC, are very important. Too few realize this. We need, as Christians, not only to understand but also to respond. Can I suggest one way to start? That is by buying, for your holiday reading, a book recently published, entitled, <em>The Noble Liar</em> - with the sub-title, "How and Why the BBC distorts the News to promote a liberal agenda." It is by Robin Aitken, who we are told, "himself spent twenty-five years working for the BBC as a reporter and executive … From where his feet are planted, the BBC's own coverage of events often looks decidedly peculiar, peppered with distortions, omissions and amplifications tailored to its own liberal agenda." And it is well written and an easy read and brings you bang up-to-date.</p>
<p>While I was reading this book when on a few days holiday this past July, my wife was reading <em>The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert</em> by Rosaria Champagne Butterfield, subtitled, "an English professor's journey into Christian faith." Formerly immersed in the lesbian world, she now lives with her husband, a pastor of a Reformed Presbyterian church and three of her four children. From what I have read of the book, she seems a remarkable woman.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Christian Humanist Worldview">(September 2019) A Christian Humanist Worldview</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>September 2019</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><em>In the 4th and 5th centuries there was a crisis over the doctrine of God – one God in three persons, and over Jesus being fully God and fully man. For many this was resolved at the Council of Chalcedon in 451AD. In the 16th and 17th centuries the Reformation helped settle the crisis over authority in the Church and Salvation, by recovering the Bible and the doctrine of "Justification by Faith". But the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries have generated a crisis over the doctrine of "Man", particularly in the West. This has led in Britain since the 1960s from an Christian influenced world-view, to a secular humanist world-view as the default assumption for ethical decision making in politics, education, medicine, the media, the arts, some sciences, business and, yes, even now in sport. Most seriously and for religious freedom, in politics this has resulted in some legislation that needs to be repealed, albeit incrementally. But politics are "downstream" of the culture. So truly to help reshape the direction of the culture of the nation, Christians must be strategically "upstream" of politics witnessing to their world-view overtly but thoughtfully, politely and graciously, in their engagement with the world. This is one aspect of Godly Living – being salt and light (Matt 5.13-16). The following, from a defunct magazine, lightly edited, is a framework for action.</em></p>
<p>In our time the word "humanism" has been claimed by those who explain human existence without any reference to God. We are unwilling to yield the term to those views that are least able of finding depth of meaning in the life of mankind.</p>
<p>We regret that Christians have rarely offered a clear alternative to secular humanism, and we seek now to set forth the salient points of what for centuries has been called "Christian" humanism.</p>
<p><strong>The Starting Point</strong></p>
<p>The proper study of mankind is not man alone, but God and man together. The triune God – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – is the Creator of the Universe and of each person within it. God, who is the ultimate meaning of the universe, is eternally self-existent, though the created order is not.</p>
<p>By thus acknowledging God, the Christian view of reality embraces more than does that of the secular humanist.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Human nature combines physical and spiritual, natural and supra-natural characteristics. To the physical, sexual, and social aspects of normal human life, in which we rejoice, must be added the understanding that human beings alone of all creation are made in God's own image.</p>
<p>We can, therefore, create, love, assert, reflect on our past and future, communicate with words, and distinguish good and evil. Even more fundamentally we can worship the One whose image we bear. This gives man an intrinsic dignity beyond mere animals. Human beings can never be understood only as animals, however complex, for at heart they are religious beings.</p>
<p><strong>Value of Life</strong></p>
<p>Because human beings, male and female, bear God's image, their life, which is his gift, claims our care and protection throughout, from the time of conception to the furthest point at which it can continue. Neither abortions of convenience nor euthanasia when social usefulness has passed can therefore be justified.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Exist</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of human life is moral and spiritual: moral, in the performance of God's will, which is both just and loving, spiritual, in a fellowship with God and other persons. No human life, however prosperous, healthy, or devoted to others is complete when this moral and spiritual development is lacking.</p>
<p><strong>The Human Task</strong></p>
<p>From his creation, humankind as male and female has been required by their marriages to people the world, given stewardship over nature, commanded by God to develop a culture and nourish human life from the productive earth.</p>
<p>Labour and leisure, science and art, family and state, belong to human life as God meant it to be. Yet the meaning of life is not found in these activities but in the God who enables them.</p>
<p><strong>Science and Art</strong></p>
<p>God created and maintains pattern and consistency in the universe, making science and technology possible. Secular humanism, lacking this ultimate foundation for science, must posit the consistency of the universe as a mysterious "given".</p>
<p>The form and materials of his creation also make art and beauty possible: human creativity thus echoes God's own.</p>
<p><strong>Truth and Error</strong></p>
<p>Something of God's character and will may be known by all people, even if dimly and with confusion. An awareness of God and of moral standards is natural to mankind, and the urge to worship, though often misdirected, is indestructible.</p>
<p>God the Creator has clearly revealed his character and will in history, culminating in Jesus Christ. This revelation, in which God interpreted for us the whole of human life and met in principle the whole of human duty, is now permanently available in Holy Scripture; and no one who lacks knowledge of it knows enough for a fully human life.</p>
<p>Though we know only in part, God's revealed truth is absolute not relative. Because truth can be known, error can be identified, and a path is thereby opened through the contemporary religious and philosophical confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Evil</strong></p>
<p>Human life is blighted by the alienation from God introduced by human disobedience after man's creation. Moral evil, although universal throughout history, is therefore abnormal. Its roots lie in human rebellion against God's Lordship and the rule of his law.</p>
<p>Ours has become a bent world: selfishness, violence, injustice, pride, self-destructiveness, and inhumanity everywhere pervade human life.</p>
<p>This evil may appear in individuals or institutions. It is manifest in governments, businesses, and families. The human will, rather than social conditions alone, however, is the decisive factor in evil. No explanation of human brutality that omits sinful choice is adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Providence</strong></p>
<p>In the face of this pervasive evil, God maintains a governance of human affairs that sets limits to evil, prospers human life, and preserves his purpose in history. The end of history, like its beginning, is under the sovereign control of God.</p>
<p><strong>Human Restoration: Reconciled to God</strong></p>
<p>To end our alienation from him and to restore human life to its original design and purpose, our Creator has acted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, a first-century Jew who was, in truth, the second person of the Trinity, God incarnate.</p>
<p>The appearance of Christ, therefore, is the most important event in all human history. By his sacrificial death, he paid the moral debt of those sinners who submit to his transforming reconciliation.<br>The loving service of God and man which Jesus taught and practised perfectly is the model of true humanness.</p>
<p><strong>The Kingdom of God Begun</strong></p>
<p>From the ministry of Christ sprang an international, multiracial community of forgiven sinners. They acknowledge a common calling to proclaim Jesus as King and to bring all human life under his sway. This community, the Church, despite failures, inconsistencies, and hypocrisies, has pioneered a many-sided humanitarianism.</p>
<p>The Christian movement has been the cultural matrix of the modern Western world. Christian fruit, however, cannot continue in society without Christian convictions.</p>
<p><strong>World Crisis</strong></p>
<p>Current social problems are overwhelming: international tensions, crime, family breakdown, abuse of the powerless (including the unborn and the aged), scarcity of resources, nuclear threat and more.</p>
<p>Christian humanism offers, not a programme to solve these problems, but a framework for their solution – truth linked to spiritual power.</p>
<p><strong>Pessimism, Optimism, Realism</strong></p>
<p><span>Human life is not perfectible and progress is not inevitable, but despair at the human prospect is no more justified than is naïve optimism. Hope for mankind lies in the knowledge that Jesus Christ, the Lord of all things, will make all things new at his Second Coming. The Christian Humanist therefore avoids both the pessimism and the over-optimism of secular humanism.</span></p>
<p>The individual Christian, facing death, can likewise know that conscious friendship with God and other persons is forever. These are not empty religious sentiments but the natural language of those who know even if partially, of their creation and redemption by a loving God.</p>
<p>In contrast to secular humanism, therefore, Christian humanism does not hesitate to speak of absolute truth, goodness, beauty, love, morality, the sanctity of life, duty, fidelity, hope and immortality. These are not empty religious sentiments but the natural language of those who know even if partially, of their creation and redemption by a loving God.</p>

                                                <p><em>On 21st July I had to preach on Equality and Faith in our morning series. In the course of which I touched on "sexual equality". Referring to Genesis 3, I said, "the Fall came and resulted in pain for the woman and pain for the man." And I said women down the years have suffered greatly in the West and worldwide; so Christians need to help make life better for women. But be careful.</em></p>
<p><em>For there is an argument that in the West radical changes were needed in the modern period in an equalizing direction up to a point in the 20th century. But from then on "the pendulum has often been swinging to the disadvantage of women but under the banner of equality." And I mentioned my wife, Joy. For when she was training to be a doctor in the late 50s and 60s the equality debate was raging (in those days she and 5 others were the only women out of about 100 medical students in her year at Guy's hospital in London). But she and others like her wanted not equality but "inequality" with men. For when they got married and had children they wanted to look after their children but keep their hand in with medicine. For it was often all or nothing at that time.</em></p>
<p><em>However, when we were back in Oxford before coming here, she was one of Rosemary Rue's "babies" (so called). Dame Rosemary, as she became, was a woman doctor (now Oxford health administrator) who earlier was forced to leave her training hospital on marriage. So she uniquely organized for women doctors (often with children and with husbands out all hours teaching in the colleges) to keep their hands in by doing even as little as two sessions a week. This scheme was so successful it became a national Women Doctor's Retainer Scheme under Ted Heath's government. The need was for inequality, not equality, to get the balance right! But, in July, I had not time to expand how things have evolved since then.</em></p>

<p><em>- Introduction by David Holloway</em></p>

<p>Two themes run in parallel through Scripture with regard to men and women. Equal dignity and significant difference. Women are badly served when their essential dignity as human beings is disrespected. They are also badly served when equality is assumed to mean sameness. Radical feminism cheered for equality, but failed to take sufficient account of difference.</p>
<p>Feminist history is often presented as four waves of agitation. First wave feminists campaigned to end legal discrimination. While they wanted equal opportunities for women, they also respected the role of women in the family. The second wave was very different!</p>
<p><strong>The evil of patriarchy</strong></p>
<p>A brilliant, but deeply troubled young American graduate student decided in 1970 that the real problem for women through the ages had been patriarchy (from the Greek 'pater' for father, and 'arche' for rule). Kate Millet used this term to describe societies where men rule over women. She argued that the means by which men rule is the traditional heterosexual married family.</p>
<p>This narrative was just one strand of a broader liberation movement where humanity was divided between oppressor and oppressed. In the feminist subplot, men were the oppressors, women the oppressed, and the family was the main place of oppression. Stay-at-home mothers are economically dependent on their husbands. To be truly free means breaking away from that dependence.</p>
<p><strong>The oppression of the family</strong></p>
<p>Women's studies courses sprung up all over America, and then beyond, promoting the idea that women's oppression is caused by the family. Marriage, motherhood and home-making were regarded as only satisfying for those who were mentally subnormal or emotionally weak.</p>
<p>For those not at university, local consciousness raising groups were formed. The aim? To make women understand that if their families got in the way of their happiness, they should leave! Nothing and nobody should stand in the way of their right to personal fulfilment. Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch (1970) was a wildly popular manifesto for unlimited sexual freedom.</p>
<p>What did all this mean at grassroots level? Family breakdown. This was facilitated because feminists had a political strategy as well. Privileges were withdrawn from the traditional family. Alternative family patterns (including single parents) were to receive full state support.</p>
<p>The benchmark of real liberation? Completely equal outcomes at a societal level. Fifty per cent of every profession were to be filled by females.</p>
<p><strong>The 'injustice' of biology</strong></p>
<p>The main barrier in the way of this grand project was the 'injustice' of biology. Nature had made men and women unequal. Women through history had been forced to bear and rear children. But, now, scientific advances meant that women could be liberated from the 'tyranny of the biological family' by means of contraception, abortion, artificial reproductive technologies and collective childcare.</p>
<p>Educationally, radical feminists wanted history to be rewritten, toppling men from their central roles in the making and shaping of important events. All written texts were now to be questioned in the light of patriarchy.</p>
<p>Next to be challenged was 'heteronormativity' (the idea that heterosexuality is normal). Adrienne Rich (1929-2012) argued that all women are naturally lesbian; that heteronormativity is an oppressive aspect of patriarchy; and that it must be abolished.</p>
<p>Any who questioned these trends could be intimidated into compliance by the threat of being labelled sexist. All this had a major impact in academia and on public policy throughout countries where Western values prevailed. But many women were totally alienated by such extreme claims.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction against violence</strong></p>
<p>'Feminism is dead!' proclaimed some newspaper headlines in the 1990s. In fact, this was the decade when third wave feminism was emerging. A central issue for third wave feminists was violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment and rape. All of which are, of course, utterly evil. But what many failed to acknowledge was that violence against women had only been exacerbated by demands for total sexual freedom.</p>
<p><strong>#MeToo</strong></p>
<p>The fourth wave of feminism continues to challenge abuse by means of social media. The #MeToo campaign has resulted in a flood of allegations.</p>
<p>All abuse is an appalling outworking of the Fall, and of sin. The instinct that justice should be done is God-given. The #MeToo movement is a moment at which Christians should be holding out the truth of God's power to bring healing and hope into the darkest situation.</p>
<p>When someone feels degraded and dehumanized by sinful abuse, the Bible offers the certainty that each of us has the dignity of having been made in God's image. And the Gospel offers a completely new start.</p>
<p>As Christians, we are not surprised that demands for unlimited sexual freedom have only resulted in increased exploitation and abuse. Women and children have not been liberated by rejection of God's boundary markers, including his good plan for marriage and family. They have been betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>God's beautiful design</strong></p>
<p>God's beautiful design for men and women shines out in contrast to the miserable effects of abuse and family breakdown. These evils have been compounded by sexual liberation.</p>
<p>All alike share the equal dignity of having been made in God's image. Our complementary differences have been gloriously designed to reflect deep eternal realities about the love of Jesus Christ for his Bride, the Church. God's design for marriage and the family is for our blessing, not our harm.</p>
<p>Christianity is good news for men and women!</p>

                                                <p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>The forthcoming election on 12 December is, from my perspective, unique. I cannot remember such an occasion when so many people are going to vote, it appears, for a candidate in whom they have little confidence. Still, their decision has been reached for, as they believe, right political reasons. But this reflects badly on democratic governance. So some are asking, "Is democracy itself fit for purpose in the 21st century?"</p>
<p><em>The Guardian Weekly</em> had a cover on the 15 November (2019) edition, containing the following: "Elections need fixing! Why isn't democracy giving clear answers any more?" The lead article was by <em>a Guardian and Observer</em> International Affairs Commentator who provided two highlighted quotes. One was, "Many citizens are expressing doubts that democracy still serves their interests." The other was, "Protesters say the political elite is corrupt and demand a clear-out, with little idea of what comes next." And with regard to recent European elections, this was said,</p>
<blockquote><div>Spain, which held its fourth general election in as many years last weekend … will now have another minority government and the possibility of another early election. That fits pan-European trends. In Germany, France, Italy and Sweden, the grip of long-dominant centrist parties has been loosened if not broken, but has mostly been replaced by instability. Britain's general election is hyperbolically described as a 'turning point'. Yet continued gridlock is a distinct possibility after 12 December.</div></blockquote>
<p>How different all this is from February 1989 when a lecture was given in the University of Chicago by a 36 year old, Francis Fukuyama, claiming that a turning point and not just in one nation but in World History<em> had arrived</em>. This was because the then Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, had said that the Soviet Union would no longer dictate to the Eastern European satellite states. Rather these states could now become democracies! So this <em>was</em> the beginning of the end of the Cold War (its symbolic end, of course, was the fall of the Berlin Wall, a little later, in November 1989 – exactly 30 years ago). In the light of all that, the lecture in Chicago was entitled, <em>The End of History</em> and Fukuyama's subsequent 1992 book was entitled, <em>The End of History</em> and <em>the Last Man</em>. Its message was that the worldwide spread of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism from, and by, the West with their lifestyles attached, could be signalling <em>the end point of humanity's socio-cultural evolution</em>. And democracy was to be the final form of human government.</p>
<p>But four years later, in 1996 Fukuyama's ideas were contradicted by another social scientist, Samuel Huntington. His best-selling book, <em>The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</em>, argued that people's cultures (at the heart of which are their religious beliefs) would be the primary source of conflict in the 21st century. So to suggest that 1989 had heralded "the End of History" was nonsense. Then came 9/11 with 2,996 dead, 19 of whom were the Al-Qaeda hijackers who had hijacked the aeroplanes involved that September 2001. So, sadly, how right Huntington seems to have been, and how wrong was Fukuyama!</p>
<p><strong>Further tragedies</strong></p>
<p>But tragically, in the West, for many democracy is still the number one "value". That is true for Ofsted and our schools' inspectors. For the British Government decreed that our British values are "democracy" (first) followed by "the rule of law", then, "individual liberty" and, finally, "mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs and for those without faith". I am sure we all want to commend all of those, <em>but not if that is all that is said</em>. For without qualification "democracy" can be dangerous.</p>
<p>I regularly remind myself of the speech Lord Selborne made in the House of Lords in the debate on what was to be the great 1944 Education Act, and with Hitler still undefeated. For he said that Anglo-Saxon democracy cannot function,</p>
<blockquote><div>… unless it is based on the Christian ethic, and if it is transplanted to any country where that ethic is rejected, it would wither and die amid great human suffering.</div></blockquote>
<p>How prophetic that has been. The so-called "Arab Spring", which was encouraged by the West, in the belief that democracy was always better than autocratic rule, has, indeed, led to "great human suffering". For in Egypt, democracy was obviously going to lead to the Muslim Brotherhood being elected into power; and there were disastrous results as we've seen. Similarly, in the name of democracy in Syria, the West supported the opposition to Assad that at one stage contained a significant proportion of extreme Muslims (connected to Al-Qaeda and some to ISIS). This has been disastrous with, some say, 400,000 dead and very "great human suffering" as a result of an inconclusive civil war. Surely, there has been a serious failure to distinguish between "authoritarian" states from "totalitarian" states. Peter Berger, the famous social scientist, explains why:</p>
<blockquote><div>The authoritarian state doesn't brook political opposition, but it leaves people more or less alone as long as they go along with the regime. By contrast, the totalitarian state seeks to control every aspect of social life. It's not enough to eschew political opposition, one must enthusiastically participate in every activity set up by the regime.</div></blockquote>
<p>The term "totalitarian" was coined by Italy's Benito Mussolini who said his Fascist regime's basic principle was that there was to be "nothing against the state, nothing without the state, nothing outside the state." And that was certainly true in the 20th century of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and their imitators elsewhere in the world, and now extreme Islamist states. And such states, even when democratically elected, are terrifying and wicked. But authoritarian states are clearly lesser evils. So how we must thank God for liberal democracies. But modern democracies cannot survive indefinitely in secular states. And that is because as Charles Caput, a retired Roman Catholic Archbishop, puts it:</p>
<blockquote><div>The deepest problem, the one that's crippling us, is that we use words like justice, rights, freedom and dignity without any commonly shared meaning to their content. We speak the same language, but the words don't mean the same thing. Our public discourse never gets down to what's true and what isn't, because it can't … After all, what can 'human rights' mean if science sees nothing transcendent in the human species … Liberal democracy doesn't have the resources to sustain its own purpose. Democracy depends for its meaning on the existence of some higher authority outside itself … Modern pluralist democracy has plenty of room for every religious faith and no religious faith. But we're lying to ourselves is we think we can keep our freedoms without revering the biblical vision – the uniquely Jewish and Christian vision – of who and what man is. Human dignity has only one source. And only one guarantee. We're made in the image and likeness of God. And if there is no God, then human dignity is just elegant words.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The answer</strong></p>
<p>So the state, like a three-legged stool, needs three things: a good political order, which is liberal democracy, a good economic order which probably is compassionate capitalism, but vitally and most importantly a good spiritual order which definitely is faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. For the real problem is human sin. That needs the gospel of forgiveness through the Cross of Christ and the resurrecting power of the Holy Spirit in the human heart. As Gladstone, the 19th century Prime Minister, well said:</p>
<blockquote><div>The State and the Church have both of them moral agencies. But the State aims at character through conduct; the Church at conduct through character … The Church brings down from heaven a divine principle of life, and plants it in the centre of the human heart to work outwards and to leaven the whole mass: the State out of the fragments of primeval virtue, and the powers of the external world, constructs a partial and elementary system, corrective and from without, and subsidiary to the great process of redemption and spiritual recovery which advances towards it from within.</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="The British Election - What Happened?">(January 2020) The British Election - What Happened?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2020</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>December 2019</strong></p>
<p>I quoted in the <em>Coloured Supplement</em> last month from <em>The Guardian Weekly</em> edition of 15 November and its cover containing the following question:</p>
<blockquote><div>Elections need fixing! Why isn't democracy giving clear answers anymore?</div></blockquote>
<p>The lead article was by a <em>Guardian and Observer</em> International Affairs Commentator who provided two highlighted quotes. One was, "Many citizens are expressing doubts that democracy still serves their interests." The other was, "Protesters say the political elite is corrupt and demand a clear-out, with little idea of what comes next." All this was, of course, in the run-up to our General Election on 12 December. The answer to that basic question is that now democracy has given a very clear answer. It, therefore, serves people's interests and to that end is fit for purpose. It can, at least, still reflect the will of the (majority) of the people. So the UK has secured at least a government capable of governing as a result. That is not to say it will govern well. So we need to pray that it does. But many of us feared that there would be a "hung Parliament" resulting in a series of disparate coalitions where little could be decided. That is a very dangerous position to be in. In our progressively secular country that could have led to violence, rioting or even worse. So how we need to thank God that such a result did not occur!</p>
<p><strong>The Facts</strong></p>
<p>Let <em>The Times</em> newspaper state the basic facts. It did so under the headline <em>Blue Dawn</em> <em>– Boris Johnson has</em> <em>won a historic victory that has redrawn the electoral map of Britain. Now he must show he can become a historic prime minister.</em></p>
<blockquote><div>The word historic is often used to describe events that in reality are quickly forgotten. Thursday's Conservative election victory will not be one of them. This was an extraordinary result. A party that was seeking a fourth term in office having presided over a decade of austerity and a fall in living standards not only gained an extra 47 seats but secured a 78-strong majority. The Tories swept to victory in swathes of seats in what have long been regarded as Labour's impregnable northern heartlands.</div></blockquote>
<p>But what really was going on? What really was behind the North's Labour attachment to Brexit and so now to the Conservatives? Yes, Jeremy Corbyn was a problem for many. However, John Waters, an Irish writer (so looking on from outside), writing about Brexit argued that it was supported as a protest vote of despair. For it was supported by …</p>
<blockquote><div>… older voters; those who work hard but are not rich; those who continue to think and observe; those who read on paper; those who are free from the propagandist deluge of the BBC, Guardian, Facebook, Twitter etc. – all finally saying, 'Enough! No more!! Please, listen to what we are saying, please respect us and our lives and our thoughts also!</div></blockquote>
<p>And Waters goes on to comment that those elites who live in big metropolitan cities, like London, who "become immune to the needs of the real world, now imagine themselves to represent the fruit of human society, when really they are the peel."</p>
<p>That is echoed in the book <em>National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy</em>, a book by Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin. This identifies four fundamentals driving the so-called "populist" wave around the world: <em>one, distrust</em> (of politicians); <em>two, destruction</em> (of nations, communities, and local cultures); <em>three, deprivation</em> (of a social context where local people can live good, economic and satisfying lives) and, <em>four, de-alignment</em> (so they are no longer attached to their old political parties).</p>
<p>And to be free of "the propagandist deluge" of the BBC and <em>Guardian</em> means much of the media is now being seen for what it promotes – "fake news". This is not in the sense of "lying" but of telling only one side of a story or one part of a story and also because of the bias of the broadcasters or journalists! Certainly the BBC is biased as to its world view and its morality. Ofcom's <em>Diversity and equal opportunities in television</em> report, published 18 September 2019, reveals bias in terms of staffing. For while in the UK population 67% are "religious", in the BBC it is only 37% that are "religious"; and while in the UK population only 2% are Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual (LGB), in the BBC it is 7% (and their target for 2020 is 8% being LGB). If people are finally saying, "Enough! No more!!" that is significant. For the BBC (the mouth-piece for elite dogmas) has shaped global plausibility structures and influenced the masses in the English speaking world, both by its UK services but also by its BBC World Service.</p>
<p><strong>The Modern World</strong></p>
<p>We are at a watershed in our nation and culture. The modern world has been shaped, since the 17th century, by the West and with a Christian world-view. And that Christian world-view came from three things: one, faith in the God of the Bible; two, tradition in terms of Biblical ethics both personally and politically; and, three, God-given human rationality as knowledge and technology were exploding.</p>
<p>But at the end of the 18th and century France and to a lesser extent Germany went rogue, deciding that human rationality was to be supreme and it was idolized (literally during the French Revolution). So God was left out of their Enlightenment (as this period of Western progress is often called). However, the English Enlightenment tradition acknowledged God. Even John Locke the great champion of toleration did not tolerate atheism, for he believed it was socially damaging (his liberalism had limits). And importantly the Methodist and the Evangelical Anglican spiritual revival were part of our English Enlightenment tradition, while the Puritan settlers' concern for liberty certainly were part of the American tradition.</p>
<p>Over the years these traditions have evolved. But for a range of reasons (including two World Wars) things came to a head in the second half of the 20th century. Since then an atheistic French tradition has been dominant with personal autonomy being the supreme value. So each person can decide what is right or wrong. However, after 50 years at last there is now a rejection of its social consequences. The majority of voters see our own nation disintegrating with, for example, 48% of children born outside marriage in England and Wales; food banks that are needed; an equalities dogma that cannot discriminate essential immigrants from potential terrorists; boys with their genitalia intact saying they are girls and using girls' toilets; and while our NHS budget is £129 billion a year, the costs of the break-down of our sexual and marital culture to the taxpayer and wider economy being probably £100 billion annually (Guy Brandon, <em>The Relationships Foundation</em>)!</p>
<p><strong>Our Christian Calling</strong></p>
<p>So Christians have now to be ready to argue for limits and a true liberalism. We have to argue for "the common good" in terms of public policy; and that invariably follows Christian ethics, and "the highest good" – trusting and obeying our heavenly Father from whom that common good derives and not least in matters of sex. That is central because the family has to be central in any society. Philosophers call it the first society. For if there is an institutional collapse of the biblical heterosexual monogamous lifelong married family, the whole collapses (as the West is beginning to experience, and ordinary people living ordinary lives know only too well).</p>
<p>Boris Johnson on his own will not be able to help recover the English Christian tradition, which the Queen is required to uphold. So our political structures need no reform. But Christian believers need to take a lead. The time is right. Our calling, surely, is now to pray and be bold, wherever God has put us, knowing as Jesus said, the way to true liberalism is to obey him:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free" </em>(John 8.31-32).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Prayer and the Fatherhood of God">(February 2020) Prayer and the Fatherhood of God</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2020</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>
<blockquote><div><em>Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" </em>(Matthew 7.7-11)</div></blockquote>
<p>This passage, of course, includes the two verses (7 &amp; 11) that provide our JPC verse(s) for 2020. It is a fundamental part of Jesus' teaching on prayer in his Sermon on the Mount. And we all need to take to heart this teaching, and then pray for our nations, our churches and ourselves. But what do we learn from this passage? At least five things.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, prayer is a command of Jesus, and it is an emphatic command. For it is repeated three times, "ask", "seek", and "knock".</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, Jesus presupposes there will be different levels at which people pray. John Piper, an American pastor, helpfully puts it like this:</p>
<blockquote><div>God stands ready to respond positively when you find him at different levels of accessibility. Ask, seek, knock – if a child's father is present, he asks him for what he needs. If a child's father is somewhere in the house but not seen, he seeks his father for what he needs. If the child seeks and finds the father behind the closed door of his study, he knocks to get what he needs. The point seems to be that it doesn't matter whether you find God immediately close at hand … or hard to see, and even with barriers between, he will hear.</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Thirdly</em>, there are promises that prayer will be answered and that, too, is emphasized by the threefold, "it will be given to you; … you will find; … it will be opened to you" (verse 7). And then verse 8 is a repeat of the three promises – so it is doubly emphatic.</p>
<p><em>Fourthly</em>, "everyone who asks receives" (verse 8) not just some. No! It is everyone.</p>
<p><em>Fifthly</em>, God will give us what is infinitely good. For if human fathers (on average) want to give their children good gifts, "how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"</p>
<p>Also note - the promise is only for "good things" to be given by our "Father who is in heaven". However, Jesus seems to imply that even earthly fathers, who are "evil", would not give a poisonous snake, if asked for by a young child. So "how much more" will our Father in heaven, who is infinitely wise and loving, sometimes not give exactly what we ask for. But if we trust and obey him, his goodness will ensure that the outcome to our prayers will always be for our good, even if it is not as, or when, expected.</p>
<p><strong>The Fatherhood of God</strong></p>
<p>But all prayer is to be to "our Father in heaven". Earlier in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus taught his disciples to pray first of all to "our Father":</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name" </em>(Matthew 6.9)</div></blockquote>
<p>So how we need to understand the Fatherhood of God and then treat that name of "Father" as special. Jim Packer, in his classic book <em>Knowing God</em>, says, when asked for a simple answer to "what is a Christian?":</p>
<blockquote><div>the richest answer I know is that a Christian is one who has God for his Father" (p 181).</div></blockquote>
<p>However, Packer must not be misunderstood. He is not asserting <em>everyone</em> has God for their Father. Asserting the universal Fatherhood of God and the universal brotherhood of man was a feature of nineteenth-century ultra-liberal theologians. But the universal "Fatherhood of God" by creation is rarely alluded to in the Bible. Yes, it is suggested by Paul after quoting Greek authors to Greek intellectuals when in Athens (Acts 17.28-29):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>… for 'in him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we are indeed his offspring'. Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So we can say that all men and women, as God's children by creation in his image (Genesis 1.27), must be respected. But by inherited sin, and in some measure, all of us can and do resist God's fatherhood and become what Jesus calls in the <em>Parable of the Weeds</em>, "sons of the evil one" (Matthew 13.38). All, therefore, need to be recreated or re-born. And the good news is that this can happen (John 1.11-12):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>He [Jesus] came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>And as we "receive Jesus" we are restored to that creation ideal. For our "new self … is being renewed in knowledge <em>after the image of its creator</em>" (Colossians 3.10-11).</p>
<p><strong>The Message of the New Testament</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, the true Fatherhood of God is enjoyed by those who "receive Jesus" – who trust in the crucified and risen Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. That is why it can be argued that how well a person understands the New Testament and the Christian faith is measured by how much they think of themselves as God's child, and having God as their Father.</p>
<p>For, very importantly, Paul makes it clear that "adoption as God's sons"</p>
<p>was the purpose of Christ's coming into the world to save us (Galatians 4.4-7):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!' So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>That redemption was achieved by Jesus dying for our sins instead of us, resulting in God's forgiveness for our past and his acceptance for our future. But such "redeeming" (or justification) was "so that we might receive adoption as sons" (verse 5). <em>All that</em> is good news (or gospel).</p>
<p>The second piece of good news is that "because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'" (verse 6). That "adoption as sons", with the Holy Spirit's power, is a motive and means for <em>Christian ethics</em> as we seek to please our Father by keeping the family rules - God's moral law - which are for our good. And the Holy Spirit in "our hearts" is also a source of <em>true assurance</em> – "the Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (Romans 8.16).</p>
<p>And a third piece of good news is that with regard to material needs (including financial needs), understanding our "adoption as sons" will lead to confident faith and prayer, not anxiety and worry. For, "your heavenly Father knows that you need them all [<em>every kind of need</em>]" (Matthew 6.32-33).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All the above, of course, relates to our real identity and destiny. This, Jim Packer suggests, we need to affirm (for our good) by regularly reciting the following mantra as utterly and completely true:</p>
<blockquote><div>I am a child of God. God is my Father; heaven is my home; every day is one day nearer. My Saviour is my brother; every Christian is my brother too" (<em>Knowing God</em>, p 207).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="Is The Athanasian Creed Relevant Today?">(1 March 2020) Is The Athanasian Creed Relevant Today?</h2><ul><li>1 March 2020</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>A fundamental Creed few know</strong></p>
<p>Anglican tradition says on Christmas Day, Epiphany, Easter Day, Ascension Day, Whitsunday plus on a number of Saints’ Days, at the main service …</p>
<blockquote><div>“… shall be sung or said … instead of the Apostles’ Creed, this Confession of our Christian Faith, commonly called the Creed of Saint Athanasius” (Book of Common Prayer, 1662).</div></blockquote>
<p>There follows in the Prayer Book a creed that is seldom said today. But why? One answer is that the Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds, we regularly use, are much shorter and were elaborations of the basic, very short, earliest creed or confession “Jesus is Lord” (Rom 10.9). Originating as baptismal creeds, such creeds simply had to be used in the baptisms of new converts as the early church was expanding. The Apostles’ Creed was used in early Western churches, the Nicene Creed in early Eastern ones.</p>
<p>However, the Nicene Creed not only served the early Church in missionary mode, it also served to exclude, as the Church grew, false teaching, not least Arianism. Arius taught that Jesus was not our eternal God come in the flesh, but a lesser being created by God. That is why the Nicene Creed says that Jesus was “eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,<em> begotten not made, of one Being with the Father.”</em></p>
<p>But what did that really mean for the man, Jesus of Nazareth? It soon was a subject of debate and conflict. But, happily, such Trinitarian issues (one God in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and the Christological debates on Jesus’ person and nature led, in the providence of God, to a sufficient conclusion at the A.D. 451 Council of Chalcedon. That result was expressed in the council’s classic <em>Chalcedonian definition</em> which echoes our so-called Athanasian Creed. “So-called” because it is not written by Athanasius but can be said to reflect his views as developed by Augustine!</p>
<p>Yes, this creed is the fullest of the creeds in its theology. But in this “untheological age” it is being neglected. So from time to time, without apology, I include the creed in a <em>Coloured Supplement</em>. Some people have argued that we can ignore it because it is expressed in terms of Greek philosophy. But that is wrong. No <em>philosophical</em> doctrines are being adopted or assumed. It is entirely <em>theological</em>.</p>
<p><strong>E.L.Mascall</strong></p>
<p>Yes, terms are used which philosophers use, but they are words used in common speech such as “being” and “person”. Any technical usage such words come to have, comes not from philosophy but Christianity and faithfulness to the Bible. As E.L. Mascall writes of that Chalcedonian definition to which this creed is related and is true of this creed:</p>
<blockquote><div>“[it] is remarkably free from technicalities. It is somewhat repetitive, for the sake of emphasis and in order to exclude specific errors; but its positive assertion is simple in the extreme. It is that the Lord Jesus Christ is one person, and that he is truly and perfectly God and is truly and perfectly man. It is not denied that this is a great and wonderful mystery or that it raises deep and perhaps insoluble problems for the human mind; but the statement itself is … lucid.”</div></blockquote>
<p>And, yes, importantly as Dorothy L. Sayers once said: “the Christian formula is not: ‘Humanity manifests certain adumbrations of the divine’, but: ‘This man was very God’.”</p>
<p>But, no, our creed is not an exhaustive theological account of the incarnation. Little is said about Jesus’ great work of saving us from sin through his death. In Mascall’s words, like the Chalcedonian definition, “it was a response to certain false views about the<em> constitution</em> of Christ, such as that he had no human soul, that the subject of his human life was not the Eternal Son, that his human nature had no distinct reality, and so on.”</p>
<p><strong>The text of the Athanasian Creed</strong></p>
<p>What then does the Athanasian Creed say? Here is a modern version from <em>An English Prayer Book:</em></p>
<blockquote><div>“Whosoever wishes to be saved before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic (or universal) faith, which faith, if anyone does not keep it whole and unharmed, without doubt he will perish everlastingly (see the ‘Comment’ below). Now, the catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the persons nor dividing the divine being. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit, but the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is all one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son and such is the Holy Spirit: the Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated; the Father infinite [Latin, ‘inmensus’], the Son infinite, and the Holy Spirit infinite; the Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal; and yet they are not three eternals but one eternal, just as they are not three uncreateds, nor three Infinites, but one uncreated and one Infinite. In the same way, the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty; and yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty. Thus the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three Gods but one God. Thus the Father is the Lord, the Son is the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the Lord; and yet not three Lords, but one Lord. Because, just as we are compelled by Christian truth to confess each person singly to be both God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, there are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is from none, not made nor created nor begotten; the Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created, but begotten; the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made nor created nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this Trinity there is no before or after, no greater or less, but all three persons are coeternal with each other and coequal. So that in all things, as has already been said, the Trinity in unity, and unity in Trinity, is to be worshipped. He therefore who wishes to be saved let him think thus of the Trinity.Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he should faithfully believe the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, the right faith is that we should believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both God and man equally. He is God from the being of the Father, begotten before the worlds, and he is man from the being of his mother, born in the world; perfect God and perfect man, having both man’s rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards his divinity and inferior to the Father as regards his humanity; who, although he is God and man, yet he is not two, but one Christ; one, however, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh but by the taking up of humanity into God; utterly one, not by confusion of human and divine being but by unity of Christ’s one person. For just as the rational soul and flesh are one man, so God and man are one Christ; who suffered for our salvation, descended to the realm of the dead, rose again the third day from the dead, ascended to heaven, sat down at the right hand of the Father, from where he will come to judge the living and the dead; at whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies and will give an account for their own actions, and those who have done good will go into life everlasting and those who have done evil into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith which, if anyone does not believe faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved.”</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>A Comment by C.S.Lewis</strong></p>
<p>On the creed’s first sentence, C.S.Lewis makes the following observation: “The operative word is <em>keep</em>; not <em>acquire</em> … but <em>keep</em>. The author, in fact, is not talking about unbelievers, but about deserters ... who having really understood and really believed, then allow themselves, under the sway of sloth or of fashion, ... to be drawn away into sub-Christian modes of thought.” So, is the Athanasian Creed relevant today? Yes, surely it is.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Life after Death (part 1) The resurrection of the body">(April 2020) Life after Death (part 1) The resurrection of the body</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>April 2020</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Apostles Creed</strong></p>
<p><em>“I believe in the Resurrection of the Body.”</em> This is what billions of Christians have confidently affirmed Sunday by Sunday over the years, as they have said the Apostles Creed. Many, without the clear Christian faith that gave rise to the Creed, have no such confidence. So the heterodox Rousseau, an 18th century Enlightenment philosopher, said: <em>“He who pretends to face death without fear is a liar.”</em> Of course, Christians believe death is the enemy, but along with the Apostle Paul it is our <em>“last enemy”</em> (1 Corinthians 15.26) for it has been conquered; and there is hope now for the other side of death. Nevertheless Christian believers still thank God for, and pray for, those involved in modern medicine who courageously are currently trying to fight death being caused by the coronavirus, and who are trying to produce healthy bodies (as Jesus miraculously produced in his earthly ministry). But science is not solving the problem of death, life’s one certainty. It is just postponing death, not defeating it.</p>
<p>Of course, if you really believe it is true that when our minds and bodies cease to function, death is the end, there are social consequences. For if you believe that there is nothing in terms of ultimate value,<em> “only triviality for a moment, and then nothing"</em>&nbsp;as the atheist philosopher Bertrand Russell said in the 20th century, you will be tempted to say, <em>“let us just satisfy our physi</em><em>cal wants and cravings, ‘for tomorrow we die’”</em> (see 1 Corinthains 15.32). But there is a wonderful solution to the problem of death. As J I Packer writes:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“Christianity stands out. Alone among the world’s faiths and ‘isms’ it views death as conquered. For Christian faith is hope resting on fact – namely, the fact that Jesus rose bodily from the grave and now lives eternally in heaven. The hope is that when Jesus comes back – the day when history stops and this world ends – he ‘will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself’ (Phil 3.21). This hope embraces all who have died in Christ as well as Christians alive at his appearing: ‘for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment’ (John 5.28-29). And the raising of the body means the restoring of the person – not just part of me, but all of me – to active, creative and undying life, for God and with God.”</em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The three stages</strong></p>
<p>Let me try to explain that more fully. The result of human sin means that everyone of us born into this world needs to be “remade” to be as God intended us to be. The Bible uses such concepts as <em>“salvation”</em>, <em>“redemption”</em>, <em>“new</em> <em>birth”</em> and so on to refer to what is needed. But God’s gift of salvation has three tenses.</p>
<p>First, there is freedom from the penalty of sin (referred to as <em>“justification”</em>). That is when by faith in Jesus Christ, who died paying your penalty, you have a new relationship with God, in fact <em>“peace with God”</em> (Romans 5.1). Secondly, there is a life-time process (referred to as <em>“sanctification”</em>) of learning to conquer the power of sin. That is when the Holy Spirit enables you (but with ups and downs) to become more like Christ. Then, thirdly, there is the raising of believers from the dead, when Jesus returns and history stops (referred to as <em>“glorification”</em>). That is when God completes this process of salvation by freeing you from the presence of sin. God does that not by the gift of the old body somehow repaired, but by an entirely new glorified body. This new body will be altogether transformed.</p>
<p>Of course, this is necessarily beyond our finite human understanding; but the gist of what will happen is not totally beyond our imagination. Paul has earlier reminded the Corinthians of the reality that, as he puts it:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face</em> [when Jesus returns]” (1 Cor 13.12).</div></blockquote>
<p>But we do see something. Take Paul’s teaching in 1 Cor 15.35-57:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“someone will ask, ‘How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?’ You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or some other grain … So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body … I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, not does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:</em><em>‘Death is swallowed up in victory.’</em><em>‘O death, where is your victory?</em><em>O death where is your sting?’</em><em>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>What happens when I die?</strong></p>
<p>First, if you <em>“confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved”&nbsp;</em>(Romans 10.9). So God will have ready for you a perfect transformed body. Most of us are aware that our bodies are not perfect; and some of us have major physical problems to deal with, especially as we get older. And some, of course, have serious physical challenges from birth. How wonderful to know that our bodies will be transformed:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye”</em> (1 Cor 15.51-2).</div></blockquote>
<p>There are no exceptions! God has perfect bodies in store for all of us on resurrection day.</p>
<p>So, secondly, you will positively not be a disembodied spirit or soul. The early Christians had to learn, and we have to learn today, that the body is essential to human identity. Created as good, your body will be transformed. And you cannot do what you like with it now. 2 Corinthians 5.10 says:</p>
<blockquote><div><em> “we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or ill.” </em></div></blockquote>
<p>We remember the origin of sin came through disordered bodily desire – for fruit (Genesis 3.6)! But we must remember, too, that <em>“if we confess our sins, he </em>[God]<em> is faithful and just to forgive us our sins”</em> (1 John 1.9).</p>
<p>But, thirdly, what about the intermediate state between the day of dying and Christ’s return? Paul seems to have little worry. Regarding his day of death, he had a desire<em> “to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better”</em> (Philippians 1.13). He also spoke of the resurrection at the future return of Christ like this:<em> “so we will always be with the Lord”</em> (1 Thessalonians 4.17). So whatever we experience after death it is being <em>“with Christ".</em>&nbsp;It is similar to what Jesus teaches about our day of death and what follows in John 14.1-3:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“ Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if&nbsp;I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.”</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So Jesus is saying that death is not like a leap into the dark, but like a journey to a prepared place. And then Jesus reassures us by saying: “I will come again and will take you to myself.” As John Stott writes:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“The primary reference is to his personal return in power and glory, which herald the general resurrection and our final state. But it seems legitimate to find a secondary reference to death, at which it may be said that Christ comes to take us to himself … Christ is to be our destination as well as our escort. He comes to take us, and he takes us to himself.”</em></div></blockquote>
<p><em>“Encourage one another with these words”</em> (1 Thessalonians 4.18). May we follow Paul’s advice to the Thessalonians on the Bible’s teaching on this subject.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="Holy Communion - Online">(May 2020) Holy Communion - Online</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2020</li><li>Doctrine and Bible Teaching</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Conflicting Views</strong></p>
<p>I was aware there were, recently in Spring 2020, all sorts of arguments going on in the blogosphere regarding Holy Communion on line – “Was it right or was it wrong?” I could not make up my mind. It is a simple fact that we “comprehend with all the saints [past as well as present]” (Ephesians 3.18) what to do in situations like this. A further fact is that Anglican clergy are ordained to, and they have promised to, teach and minister (that means or includes taking services) according to the true understanding of the Anglican tradition which, of course, is biblical and expressed in its Canon of Canons, Canon A5:</p>
<blockquote><div>“The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the 39 Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.”</div></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, in the early days of “the lock down” many of us thought it might only be for a relatively short period. But, of course, we soon learnt we were in for the long haul. And also I was very conscious of the Church of England Canons which say, quite clearly, that all Anglicans should share in Communion particularly at Easter and Pentecost. But at JPC we had not made provision in any way for that to happen and we soon should be making provision for Whitsunday (or Pentecost).</p>
<p><strong>The Canons of the Church of England</strong></p>
<p>Canon B15 <em>Of the receiving of Holy Communion</em> is clear. It says this:</p>
<p>1. It is the duty of all who have been confirmed to receive the Holy Communion regularly, and <em>especially at the festivals of Christmas, Easter and Whitsun or Pentecost</em>.</p>
<p>2. The minister shall teach the people from time to time, and <em>especially before the festivals of Christmas, Easter and Whitsun or Pentecost</em>, that they come to this holy sacrament with such preparation as is required by <em>The Book of Common Prayer.</em></p>
<p>So what is the solution? First, I’ll give a simple commonsense theological argument that comes from a London church with which I agree. Then I will spend time arguing how this is compatible with the Anglican tradition and even required by the Anglican tradition in a much more legalistic way</p>
<p><strong>A Common-Sense Theological Solution</strong></p>
<p>So one Anglican church in London argues as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>When Paul narrates the last supper in 1 Corinthians 11 there is a strong emphasis on togetherness: ‘I hear that when you come together...’ (11:18); ‘When you come together...’ (v. 20); ‘When you come together to eat...’ (v. 33). It is for this reason that we would not envisage sharing the Lord’s Supper if we were simply live-streaming, because it’s not possible to celebrate the Lord’s Supper without this vital corporate element. However, our experience with zoom is that whilst it is still a second-best to gathering physically, it does still enable some kind of ‘coming together’. Whilst there is no direct biblical instruction concerning virtual gatherings (!), I think there is biblical precedent for flexibility in observing ordinances when the circumstances demand it. For example, whilst in general it’s best to baptize someone in the presence of a local congregation who can witness the baptism and receive the new member into fellowship, there’s an example in Acts 8:38 where that is not possible, and so Philip baptizes the Ethiopian eunuch mid-way through his journey. Similarly, it is common in many churches to bring the Lord’s Supper to a permanently shut-in member who is unable to attend the corporate gathering, and “zoom communion” seems like a sensible and temporary extension of that kind of flexibility.We are not suggesting that this solution is ideal, and we certainly look forward to when things are back to normal, but we also want to continue to make use of the means of grace the Lord has provided as best we can.”</div></blockquote>
<p>Such is the conclusion of Christians in London.</p>
<p><strong>The Anglican Tradition</strong></p>
<p><em>The Book of Common Prayer</em> (based on Archbishop’s Cranmer amazing verbal skills) is still fundamental to Anglican law and practice (see Canon A5 above). The rubrics for the conditions necessary for Holy Communion are set out in that 1662 book. They rule that “there shall be no communion, except four (or three at least) communicate with the Priest [<em>or Presbyter</em>].” And for a “Communion of the Sick”, in someone’s private house, “three or two at the least” of relatives or friends are necessary. However, the very final words of the rubric at the end of the Communion of the Sick service are these:</p>
<blockquote><div>“In the time of the plague, sweat, or other like contagious times of sickness or diseases, when none of the Parish or neighbours can be gotten to communicate with the sick in their houses, for fear of the infection, upon special request of the diseased, the Minister may <em>only</em> communicate with him.”</div></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, “in time of the plague” it is legal to have a congregation of one! So I realized what was possible. According to Anglican tradition I, as an ordained Presbyter, may provide Holy Communion in our house in Jesmond, for my wife. For, she and I, are …</p>
<blockquote><div>“… in the time of … contagious … sickness, when none of the Parish or neighbours can be gotten to communicate with the sick in their houses, for fear of the infection” (BCP 1662).</div></blockquote>
<p>So, God willing, Wednesday evening next (6th May), at 8.00 pm I will celebrate Holy Communion according to the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> in its modern language service version (from the old ASB) with my wife, Joy. However, at the same time this service will be Zoomed on Wednesday to communicant members of our church. They will form a virtual “mid-week central meeting”.</p>
<p><strong>A Central Meeting</strong></p>
<p>So we invite members of Home Groups, others in small groups and other communicant members of the church to be in this Zoom meeting. And all who wish will be able to eat bread and drink wine (<em>that they provide for themselve</em>s) when I say the words of administration for the bread and give the bread, and for the wine and give the wine, to my wife.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the service at 8.30 pm people will leave the all church meeting and can go to their smaller groups for 8.40 pm in new Zoom meetings. I may say, that our PCC, meeting recently on Zoom has supported this proposal. For in this way communicant church members will be able to engage in remembering Jesus with bread and wine along with all those gathered together by Zoom.</p>
<p>It is important that only people who should be communicating, have the bread and the wine. I believe this is a genuine Holy Communion service. So "the table" should be “fenced” - hence only a Presbyter should be celebrating and in charge. It really needs to involve only baptized and believing Christian people and that is why we cannot stream such a service on a Sunday. It is solemn occasion and needs to be reverently and thoughtfully enacted. That is why the words of the Book of Common Prayer service in modern language are so helpful. Indeed, Article 25 (of the <em>Thirty-nine Articles</em>) concludes:</p>
<blockquote><div>“in such only as worthily receive the same [<em>bread and wine</em>] they have a wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.”</div></blockquote>
<p>But, positively, we need to thank God that “in a plague” we can be ministered to individually but also, by modern science have a corporate “thanksgiving” for all Jesus has done for us on the Cross, is doing by his Holy Spirit in our lives, and will do for us one day when he comes again.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="A Christian Response to Racial Difference">(June 2020) A Christian Response to Racial Difference</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>June 2020</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Facing some biblical facts</strong></p>
<p>When a country like the USA …</p>
<blockquote><div>“… goes through a trauma as it has since the killing by the police of <em>[African American]</em> George Floyd, the impact is felt world-wide. Mr Floyd’s death has provoked popular protests in dozens of countries. … On Saturday in Parliament Square in London, the largest of many demonstrations in Britain, tens of thousands of people braved chilly squalls and the risk of COVID-19, which had led government ministers to call for protests to be shunned. They shouted Mr Floyd’s name, chanted ‘Black Lives Matter’ and, every now and then, dropped to one knee with one clenched fist raised skyward. The crowd, overwhelmingly young and racially mixed, mostly wore masks but paid no attention to social-distancing constraints.”</div></blockquote>
<p>So reported <em>The Economist</em> (8 June 2020) in an article headlined “How George Floyd’s death reverberates around the world.” But what should our response be? What does the Bible teach? The Apostle Paul’s experience in Athens, a multi-racial city if ever, teaches some essentials about racial difference.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, our God of creation has created everyone equal. Paul said: “He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth … ‘in him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said, ‘for we are indeed his offspring’” (Acts 17. 26,27). So, he is the Father of us all, of whatever tribe, race or nationality, by creation as well as, supremely (for believers), by redemption.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, God has created the diverse “glory” of the nations. Different tribes, races and nationalities are not the result of the Fall. For we read “he made from one man every nation of mankind … <em>having determined [i.e. previously]</em> allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place” (Acts 17.26). So, at the end of history, in the New Jerusalem that comes down from heaven, “by its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it … They will bring into it the glory and honour of the nations” (Rev 21.24,26).</p>
<p>God’s first command to man was to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it” (Gen 1.28). And as people obediently dispersed, early cultures developed. Gen 4.20-22 speaks of farming, music and early science. However, while culture can produce what is splendid and glorious, in a fallen world all is marred by sin and some marred directly by Satan. But heaven will witness the true cultural glory of the nations.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly</em>, God will judge tribes, races and nations for their sins (Acts 17.30-31): “… he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.” Paul knew the sinfulness of the Athenians’ multi-faithism, while respecting their culture (his quoting Athenian poets proves his respect). As John Stott says:</p>
<blockquote><div>“we learn … that a respectful acceptance of the diversity of <em>cultures</em> does not imply an equal acceptance of the diversity of <em>religions</em>. The richness <em>[or glory]</em> of each particular culture should be appreciated, but not the idolatry which may lie at its heart.”</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Fourthly</em>, God has been creating in this world a truly multi-lingual, multi-coloured, multi-racial, multi-national community, of which that embryonic new Athenian Church was, and is, a part. For we read “some men joined him <em>[Paul]</em> and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them” (Acts 17.34). One day this growing earthly community will be transformed, when Christ returns, into a heavenly and perfect community of myriads upon myriads of “ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation” (Rev 5.9). So, now, abhor racism and welcome those of other colours and nations.</p>
<p><strong>Facing some slavery facts</strong></p>
<p>However, to understand the present we must understand the past, including Britain’s shocking transportation to the Americas of 3.1 million Africans (of whom 2.7 million arrived), many for US slavery and the worst ever known:</p>
<blockquote><div>“In Brazil, the slave had many more rights than in the United States,” writes Nathan Glazer. “He could legally marry, he could, indeed had to, be baptized and become a member of the Catholic Church, his family could not be broken up for sale, and he had many days on which he could either rest or earn money to buy his freedom. The Government encouraged manumission ... In short: the Brazilian slave knew he was a man, and that he differed in degree, not in kind, from his master … [In the US] the slave was totally removed from the protection of organized society (compare the elaborate provisions for the protection of slaves in the Bible); his existence as a human being was given no recognition by any religious or secular agency; he was totally ignorant of, and completely cut off from, his past; and he was offered absolutely no hope for the future. His children could be sold; his marriage was not recognized; his wife could be violated or sold … and he could also be subject, without redress, to frightful barbarities … The slave could not, by law, be taught to read or write; he could not practice any religion without the permission of his master; and could never meet with his fellows, for religious or any other purposes, except in the presence of a white; and finally, if a master wished to free him, every legal obstacle was used to thwart such action. This was not what slavery meant in the ancient world, in medieval and early modern Europe, or in Brazil and the West Indies.”</div></blockquote>
<p>However, thanks significantly to the late 18th and early 19th century Evangelical Revival, William Wilberforce’s <em>Slave Trade Act</em> of 1807 abolished the slave trade in the British Empire. Then the <em>Slavery Abolition Act</em> of 1833 was passed that finally abolished slavery but on a gradual basis. This abolishing was achieved in the US with a Civil War and Lincoln issuing the <em>Emancipation Proclamatio</em>n on 1 Jan 1863; and the <em>Thirteenth Amendment</em> to the Constitution was ratified on 6 Dec 1865. But black men and women were still being grossly humiliated for 100 years and suffering in other ways. Then in 1964 the American <em>Civil Rights Act</em> was passed after Martin Luther King had amazed the world with his successful and peaceful black protest movement. But all is still not well – witness George Floyd’s brutal killing.</p>
<p><strong>Something forgotten</strong></p>
<p>What is a Christian response? We first need to admit that we are all sinners and subject to God’s law. Then we need the truth about the problems, in addition to that of police brutality, behind the current protests. Also, will they be solved by structural and institutional change that Governments and other agencies alone can bring? Or is it personal reform by all of us that is needed? May I suggest it is both, together with changed prejudices and appropriate resources. Also, we could well remember that in March 1965, in the wake of the new Civil Rights Act, a US social scientist, Daniel Moynihan, produced a report on the black family and <em>The Case for National Action</em>. His thesis was that the black family, “battered and harassed by discrimination, injustice, and uprooting, is in the deepest trouble.” While many young blacks “are moving ahead to unprecedented levels of achievement, many more are falling further and further behind.” Moynihan noted that, inevitably in such a situation, there were more lone mothers, less marrying, less father involvement in the black family, and so on, than in white families. And all that generates poverty. His findings exactly parallel those of the late Norman Dennis, the Newcastle University social scientist, regarding his research on family formation among the white poor.</p>
<p>Therefore, one Christian response is to stress the need for conversion to Jesus Christ and for laws, education and resources to help restore Christ’s marriage ethic of marrying once and for life, for all - black and white. But, since 1965 and “the sixties culture”, permissive legislation has led to more family disintegration, particularly damaging the poor, black and white. To prove a point: what happened soon after the protests in Parliament Square on 6 June? Answer: MPs voted 231 to 16 in favour of the Government’s Bill to introduce no-fault divorce in England and Wales! So how we need to pray for an Evangelical Revival that changes people <em>and</em> structures for the glory of God, and the good of all races, in our country and in the wider world.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="How Should Christians Respond to COVID-19?">(August 2020) How Should Christians Respond to COVID-19?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>August 2020</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>Practical responses</strong></p>
<p>According to one poll of Christian people during the lock down period, 48% have responded to Covid-19 by being more prayerful; 61% more neighbourly; 44% more fatigued; 38% more anxious; and 57% more thankful. And with regard to how they think about the disease many will be trusting in God not knowing what to think but can, with the Psalmist say,</p>
<blockquote><div>“God is our refuge and strength,a very present help in trouble.Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way,and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.though its waters roar and foamthough the mountains tremble at its swell.”</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>How you can begin to think about the pandemic</strong></p>
<p>Some distinguish between “moral” and “natural” evil. Take, for example, the terrible tragedy in Lebanon on 4th August 2020, when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded. Having been stored unsafely since 2013, it killed at least 137 people and injured about 5000 others. This seems to be a “moral evil”, because many are saying it was due to government negligence. That means human agency was a major contributing factor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the tragedy in New York on the 9th September 2001 was also a “moral evil”. That was when the twin towers of the World Trade Centre collapsed killing 2,606 people plus the 157 people on board the two Boeing 767 jet aircraft that Islamist Al-Qaeda terrorists were flying into the towers. Human agency, certainly, was clear in that event.</p>
<p>But what about more “natural” events such as diseases like Covid-19 and other diseases, and, then, environmental events like lightning strikes, floods and earthquakes? These are classed as “natural (not moral) evils”. So how should we respond to these evils? Answer: with care.</p>
<p><strong>Being careful</strong></p>
<p>Care has to be taken. For we know that certainly with regard to disease or health conditions you cannot say that all sickness is due to the sick person’s sin. Jesus made that clear in John 9 when he healed a man blind from birth. For he was asked, “who sinned?” And, verse 3,</p>
<blockquote><div>“Jesus answered, ‘it was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.”</div></blockquote>
<p>Also, in the Old Testament we read that Job’s sickness was not due to his own sin, but to Satan! And the Apostle Paul wrote this about his illness:</p>
<blockquote><div>“a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness’” (2 Cor 12.7-9).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Luke 13.1-5</strong></p>
<p>But Jesus’ teaching on suffering is found in Luke 13.1-5:</p>
<blockquote><div>“There were some present at that very time who told him [<em>Jesus</em>] about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices [<em>a state-inflicted atrocity (so moral evil)</em>]. 2 And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? 3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. 4 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell [<em>an accident (so natural evil)</em>] and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? 5 No, I tell you; <em>but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish</em>.”</div></blockquote>
<p>In one sense all diseases and disasters are a result sin. So the whole created order is “groaning” due to the rejection of God’s word by our first parents (Rom 8.22) - thus there is a corporate as well as an individual dimension to sin. But note: Jesus does not say that these sufferers under Pilate or in the Siloam accident were sinless. Rather Jesus is telling <em>those with him</em> that <em>unless they</em> repent <em>they too</em> will perish. Jesus is clear: no one can assume that those who were killed were more sinful than those escaping such killings.</p>
<blockquote><div>“The assumption seems to be,” to quote Don Carson on Luke 13, “that all deserve to die. If some die under a barbarous governor, and others in a tragic accident, it is no more than they deserve. But that does not mean that others deserve any less. Rather, the implication is that it is only God’s mercy that has kept them alive … Jesus treats wars and natural disasters not as agenda items in a discussion of the mysterious ways of God, but as incentives to repentance. It is as if he [<em>Jesus</em>] is saying that God used disaster as a megaphone to call attention to <em>our </em>guilt … to the imminence of his righteous judgment if he sees no repentance … Jesus might have added (as he does elsewhere) that peace and tranquility, which we do not deserve, show us God’s goodness and forbearance.”</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>God’s Judgement</strong></p>
<p>The Old Testament is so clear. When people, particularly his own people, forsake the one true God, they suffer – in those days not least by military defeat and exile. And Jesus is teaching that such a principle has not been suspended with his coming. So, the response to God’s “megaphone” is not to deny the reality of sin and judgment, nor to blame others, but to examine ourselves and ask where we have gone wrong<br>.<br>But can the modern world believe in such divine acts of “judgment”? I was in York for the General Synod on Monday morning 9th July 1984 when, in the early hours, the south transept of York Minster caught fire causing millions of pounds worth of damage. This was three days after the then Archbishop of York had consecrated a man as Bishop of Durham who publicly denied the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ and cast doubt on his Empty Tomb. The fire was caused by freak lightning. But was it <em>just</em> freak lightning? Because I had been involved in the protest about the consecration, a very senior churchman said to me, while waiting for breakfast, “it makes you think doesn’t it?” Archbishop Michael Ramsey, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><div>“When men and nations turn away from God’s laws and prefer the courses dictated by pride and selfishness to the courses dictated by conscience, calamitous results follow. God … is present in judgement through catastrophes which follow human willfulness … [But] as the judgment of God is accepted and felt, so in the same moment may his lovingkindness and mercy be found … Let it however be remembered ‘judgement begins at the house of God’ (1 Peter 4.17). The Church shows the message of divine judgement to the world as she sees judgement upon herself and begins to mend her ways.”</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Covid-19</strong></p>
<p>A controversial clergyman said, on American TV, the very evening of that fateful day, 9th September 2001, that the country’s atheistic secularists, together with their resulting morality, had contributed to the murderous event at the World Trade Centre that day. I am sure that was very unwise without first self-examination.</p>
<p>So, we too should be careful but, nevertheless, treat Covic-19 as God’s “megaphone” to us in the UK and examine ourselves. We too may see the social havoc godless progressive secularism is wreaking on our society in the UK and also around the world through globalization. But we should examine ourselves as individuals and Churches as to where we are failing so that such secularism is able to thrive.</p>
<p>And if nothing else, are we not failing to pray – not just for the sick and hospitals but for our society and for revival and for a positive end to the pandemic? And whatever happened to national days of prayer?</p>                    <hr><h2 id="'Time" Beyond the Grave">(October 2020) "Time" Beyond the Grave</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>October 2020</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>Sadly many in the secular world echo the atheistic philosopher Bertrand Russell who once said, “when I die I rot and nothing of my ego will survive.” In contrast is the glorious hope of the Christian who sees a renewed world and existence opening up before them beyond the grave.</p>
<p>But we need to be careful in what we say in detail about life after death. Our Anglican forefathers seemed to advise caution lest we are more dogmatic than Scripture about what happens when we die and when <em>“in Christ shall all be made alive… at his coming”</em> (1 Corinthians 15.22-23). For originally there were 42 Articles (of faith) that Archbishop Cranmer produced. But they were reduced to the famous 39 by among other things excluding the two that related to life after death and what happens before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ at the end of world history as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>The human experience of time</strong></p>
<p>The perplexing issue seems to be “time” itself and the fact that human experience of time is very different to God’s experience of time. C S Lewis points out that because in our lives one moment disappears before the next comes along, we take for granted that, I quote:</p>
<blockquote><div>“… this time series – this arrangement of past, present and future – is not simply the way life comes to us but the way all things simply exist. We tend to assume that the whole universe and God himself are always moving on from past to future just as we do. But many learned men do not agree with that. It was the theologians who first started the idea that some things are not in time at all; later the philosophers took it over; and now some of the scientists are doing the same” <em>(Mere Christianity). </em></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The divine experience of time</strong></p>
<p>Leaving aside philosophers and scientists, we need to heed the theologians. Many have taught that God was not “in time” as we know it. That is because of a straightforward reading of the Bible. For it seems to teach that God created time. So he must be thought of as being outside time. Take Genesis 1.1 and Genesis 1.5, <em>“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth … and there was evening and there was morning the first day.”</em> And then take John 1.1: <em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.”</em> So William Craig writes of the Word who became flesh in Jesus as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>“It is not hard to interpret this passage in terms of the Word’s timeless unity with God – nor would it be anachronistic to do so given the first century Jewish philosopher Philo’s doctrine of the divine Logos [the Word] and Philo’s holding that time begins with creation.”</div></blockquote>
<p>And there are a number of other passages, in the Old and New&nbsp;Testaments, that teach that God is outside time or time being different to God. Here are a few examples: Jude 25, <em>“to the only God, our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.”</em> 2 Timothy 1.9, “[God’s] <em>purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began</em> [Greek before times eternal]”. And, Psalm 90.4 says, <em>“For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past or a watch in the night.”</em> So the Apostle Peter can say (2 Peter 3.8),<em> “But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.”</em></p>
<p><strong>God’s ways.</strong></p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah is clear (Isaiah 55.9):<em> “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my way higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.”</em> That means there is a radical contrast between our <em>“ways”</em> and God’s – between how we experience things in contrast to God. So, while all “our ways” - all we do - is in a four-dimensional world (three of space and one of time), God’s reality will be infinitely greater. And while how we think about things is based on our life in this spatio-temporal world, how God thinks about things, as Isaiah says, is infinitely <em>“higher”</em> than our thinking and understanding and even imagining (<em>“as the heavens are higher than the earth”</em>). On that basis C S Lewis has constructed a helpful analogy with regard to time:</p>
<blockquote><div>“If you picture time as a straight line along which we have to travel, then you must picture God as the whole page on which the line is drawn. We come to the parts of the line one by one: we have to leave A behind, before we get to B; and cannot reach C, until we leave B behind. God, from above, outside, or all round, who contains the whole line, sees it all”<em> (Mere Christianity).</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that is beyond our imagination. But that is why we cannot be dogmatic about what life is like once we transition to eternity and the eternal world (into life beyond death and into God’s time and into existence as God experiences it). All we can do is trust what has been revealed. As Deuteronomy 29.29 makes so clear: <em>“The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.”</em></p>
<p>That is why the Bible has to use analogies (or picture language as in the book of Revelation) that help our human imagination understand something of the nature of God and the eternal world and the experience of life in it. And that is sufficient for our trust and obedience now in this world - for doing “<em>all the words of this</em> [God’s] <em>law</em> [or, Hebrew, teaching]”. Paul himself explains the situation with his well-known analogy: <em>“Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been known fully”</em> (1 Corinthians 13.12).</p>
<p><strong>“Face to face”</strong></p>
<p>Paul suggests in 1 Corinthians 13.12 there are only two alternatives - seeing “dimly” and seeing “face to face”; and the transition to seeing face to face is instantaneous. In 1 Corinthians 15.51-52 Paul says: <em>“Behold I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye</em> [i.e. instantaneously], <em>at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed”.</em> That is for those who are alive when Christ returns.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, Paul speaks as though he will be with Christ immediately he dies. This is in 2 Corinthians 5 (see JPC sermon on 4 October 2020) which is the same as Philippians 1.21: <em>“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain…I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ which is far better.”</em> And. of course, the repentant dying thief on the Cross was told by Jesus,<em> “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</em></p>
<p>Maybe C S Lewis suggestion about God’s view of time is helpful in reconciling Paul’s statements. Viewed from the human time frame, there is a delay in the resurrection of individuals; but our experience in God’s time must be very different. That is why for the believer there is no delay so “to die is gain.” And remember Jesus words in John 14.3, <em>“if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.”</em></p>
<p>Because of that promise, John Stott asks:</p>
<blockquote><div>“is it fanciful to suppose that when the dying martyr Stephen said he saw Jesus standing at God’s right hand, Jesus had in fact risen from his throne in order to fetch or welcome him?”</div></blockquote>
<p>Certainly there was an immediacy for Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Let me conclude with John Stott’s summary of John 14.1-3:</p>
<blockquote><div>“There is no need for us to speculate about the precise nature of heaven. We are assured on the authority of Jesus Christ that it is the house and home of his Father and ours, … that this home is a prepared place containing many rooms or resting places, and that he himself will be there. What more do we need to know? To be certain that where he is, there we will be also should be enough to satisfy our curiosity and allay our fears.”</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="“The Second Coming Of Christ” – Is It Believable?">(December 2020) “The Second Coming Of Christ” – Is It Believable?</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>December 2020</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p>In the early church one of the great differences between the Christian and the non-Christian world was the Christian “hope”. So non-Christians wanted to know <em>a reason</em> not for the Christians’ faith but for their hope. In his first letter, the apostle Peter had said that hope was the result and purpose of his readers being born again:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead</em> (1 Peter 1.3).</div></blockquote>
<p>So he then can say:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>…always</em> [be] <em>prepared to make a defence to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect</em> (1 Peter 3.15).</div></blockquote>
<p>What then does the Bible teach about the Second Coming and is it reasonable to believe that it will happen?</p>
<p><strong>The facts of the Second Coming of Christ.</strong></p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 4.14-17 Paul writes this in his key passage regarding the Second Coming:</p>
<blockquote><div>For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.”</div></blockquote>
<p>And all that is why the Christian’s greatest hope is centred on the Second “Coming” (the <em>Parousia</em> in Greek) of Christ. That word, “Parousia”, is significant. For the word was something of a technical term in the first century. It was used for an official visit in person by an emperor to part of his empire. And it was the manifestation of his sovereignty where he visited. Of course, he was emperor all along. But now he was revealed with all sorts of razzamatazz and noise. And so the New Testament encourages us to look forward to the Second Coming of Christ using that analogy. The adoption of this word implies a revelation of God in and through the personal and cosmically powerful visitation to our world by Jesus, already the risen and reigning King of Kings and Lord of Lords. As John Stott says:</p>
<blockquote><div>It can hardly be fortuitous that he <em>[Paul]</em> is writing this to the Thessalonians among whom, at least according to his critics, he defied Claudius Caesar’s decrees by announcing ‘that there is another king, Jesus’ (Acts 17.7). The Christian hope, however, is more than the expectation that the King is coming; it is also the belief that when he comes, the Christian dead will come with him and the Christian living will join them.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is all this believable?</strong></p>
<p>How can we believe all this? Can we give a reason for this hope that we have? Well, the simple answer to people in a very secular world asking questions is to echo Paul. We say it is believable <em>“since we believe that Jesus died and rose again”</em> (1 Thessalonians 4.14). That is the grounding for the Christian assurance in many claims. Granted that, it is entirely believable. But the questioner needs to be reassured that the Christian does not believe this is all simple description. For this revelation of Christ as the king of the universe <em>is the closure of human history and existence as we know it.</em> So analogies and symbolism have to be used to describe what will happen. Hence the appropriateness of likening the Second Coming of Jesus to the visit of the Emperor. It is as Calvin famously said five centuries ago about…</p>
<blockquote><div>…modes of speaking that describe God to us in human terms. For because our weakness does not attain to his exalted state, the description of him that is given to us must be accommodated to our capacity so that we may understand it. Now the mode of accommodation is for him to represent himself to us not as he is in himself, but as he seems to us.</div></blockquote>
<p>Surely D.W.B.Robinson, a former Archbishop of Sydney, was so right when he wrote in <em>The Hope of Christ’s Coming</em>:</p>
<blockquote><div>Confidence in proclaiming the fact of Christ’s coming must be accompanied by caution in attempting to describe the event in detail. There are three reasons for this caution. <em>First</em>, because like the day of the Lord in the Old Testament this event transcends the limits of our present human experience, and literal interpretations too easily land us in absurdities. <em>Secondly</em>, because the Bible itself clothes its truths in figurative language more readily than we Westerners may suppose … <em>[So]</em> it would be dangerous to press Paul’s picture much beyond his main point, namely, that the faithful departed, far from missing the joy and triumph of the Lord’s coming, will in fact be found to be already members of his party, or at least higher up on the table of precedence than ourselves <em>[who are still alive]</em>. The <em>third</em> reason for caution is that, as the experience of the Jews shows, prophecy is rarely understood as to the nature of its actual occurrence until its fulfilment.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The bodily resurrection and the transformation of the universe<br></strong></p>
<p>From the many statements and pictures in the New Testament seven at least clear truths emerge for us to be full of hope. <em>One</em>, Christ will return to this world of space and time and “every eye will see him” (Revelation 1.7). <em>Two</em>, his coming will bring human history to a close. <em>Three</em>, there will then be the bodily resurrection and judgment. <em>Four</em>, judgment will be seen to be <em>“according to what they</em>&nbsp;[people] <em>had done”</em> and <em>“if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire”</em> (Revelation 20.12,15). <em>Five</em>, for the believer the resurrection of the body is a matter for great hope. Gone will be the limitations and sinful desires of “the body of sin” (Romans 6.6) or as in Romans 7.24 <em>“this body of sin”</em>. And the knowledge that we will one day be changed is an incentive to holy living, in the power of the Spirit by whom Christ has already been raised. Paul writes:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself </em>(Philippians 2.20-21).</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Six</em>, such a transformation explains why we have difficulty in describing what will happen. For it is all part of God’s new creation, the foretaste of which has been seen in the resurrection body of Christ.</p>
<p><em>Seven</em>, the climax is when <em>“the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar”</em> (2 Peter 3.10). Peter had already spoken about <em>“times of refreshing”</em> and of God sending <em>“the Christ appointed for you</em> [Jewish people],<em> Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago”</em> (Acts 3.21). Then Paul said this is when <em>“the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God”</em> (Romans 8.21). And, finally, John referred to it in his great vision:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away </em>(Revelation 21.1-4).</div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="In Person Services and Abraham Lincoln">(January 2021) In Person Services and Abraham Lincoln</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2021</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>In-Person Services</strong></p>
<p>On the 8th January 2021 Ramzi Adcock, our executive minister, wrote this to everyone on the JPC mailing list:</p>
<blockquote><div>“The current situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is serious. The Government has asked us to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS. Under the current regulations, the Government has permitted public worship to continue, if it is safe to do so. The Church of England urges churches "to be exceptionally cautious". There is of course good news regarding vaccinations, but the NHS is on the verge of being overwhelmed and we are yet to see the full impact of the mixing over Christmas and the new variant.</div></blockquote>
<p>We are therefore <em>pausing our in-person services for this Sunday 10th January and reconsidering the 17th January</em>. We are committed to doing what we can 'in-person' as well as continuing to providing online provision. We need time to assess what is best and we'll keep you informed. Of course, the church has not stopped and we continue to meet together online. Can I take this opportunity to remind you that each week we post out DVDs of the full services, audio CDs (containing songs, readings, and sermon) and sermon transcripts – please let us know if you would like those. We also have the equipment and people willing to help you access online services and zoom – so please get in touch so we can help get you set up if you'd like that.”</p>
<p>So, on the 14th January the PCC Standing Committee met to discuss what we believed was the right thing to do in the current situation – to continue to pause, or to go ahead with in-Person services. This was after the Senior Staff Team had met the previous day to discuss the situation. As members of the church will know from Jon Teasdale’s email, we have decided to pause in-person services this Sunday (the 17th) together with the next two, (24th and 31st January) and then review the situation on Thursday 4th February. As someone said to me, this is “a 55-45 issue”. It is so hard to decide. But thank God that he does guide us in difficult finely balanced situations; and thank God the Government is not imposing a blanket lock-down on all churches. It has allowed the local churches to decide what is appropriate for them. So, after we decided, it was interesting to hear about another larger Anglican evangelical church in the North and what Christ Church, Fulwood, in Sheffield, decided. They report:</p>
<blockquote><div>“The in-person services have been suspended for the time being. Given the increasing risk posed by gathering in person and the huge strain the NHS is under, we feel this is the most loving decision to take in the short term. Please be assured that we will continue to review this decision and we will look to restart our in-person services as soon as circumstances allow.”</div></blockquote>
<p>That is our position almost exactly. Also, we have learnt that St Thomas’s, Haymarket (Newcastle upon Tyne) have decided to pause. It is simply the case that Christians cannot ignore the Government’s advice and requests. For Paul is emphatic (and probably writing under Nero) when he writes:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God … For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad”</em> (Romans 13.1,3).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Wider World</strong></p>
<p>So, unless the governing authorities forbid what God plainly orders or orders what God plainly forbids (Acts 5.29), we need to heed their strong advice and requests. Regarding our local leaders, the BBC this past week reported seven council leaders as saying:</p>
<blockquote><div>The position we find ourselves in may be better than in other parts of the country, but we still have a long way to go. If we are to avoid some of the scenes we've seen in London and elsewhere, with hospitals reaching capacity with Covid-19 patients, we must continue do everything we can to limit the spread of the virus. There is always a delay between the point of infection and people requiring hospital treatment if they become seriously ill, so we cannot afford to let our guard down.</div></blockquote>
<p>The leaders statement also added that the new more infectious strain of the virus accounted for roughly half of all cases in the region including in Gateshead, Sunderland and North Tyneside. And they concluded:</p>
<blockquote><div>as Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty outlined, reducing your social contact with others remains vital and by following the guidance we can all do our bit to protect our communities.”</div></blockquote>
<p>A further consideration is Jesus saying, <em>“let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven”</em> (Matthew 5.16). Also, Paul told Timothy he <em>“must be well thought of by outsiders”</em> (1 Timothy 3.7). So, with many <em>“outsiders”</em> having made huge sacrifices of income and even going bankrupt through shutting down to control the virus, will they <em>“give glory to God”</em> when we don’t pause, especially when we have services and other meetings on line?</p>
<p><strong>Abraham Lincoln Proclamation</strong></p>
<p>But while we were having to weigh all the pros and cons this week, we’ve been reading in staff prayers the book of Amos. And in chapter 4 we are told how the ancient people of Israel had been experiencing, one after the other, famine, drought, crop failures, plagues (as in Egypt) and destruction (as with Sodom and Gomorrah). But after each disaster is the fivefold refrain: <em>“yet you did not return to me”</em> (Amos 4.6,8,9,10 and 11). However, during the week I came across, in a letter, the US President, Abraham Lincoln’s proclamation of 30 March 1863 (two years after the founding of JPC) establishing a National Day of Prayer in the middle of the US Civil War. And Lincoln doesn’t try to deal with any of the conflict issues. For he sees <em>one thing</em> necessary above all, as you can see. I quote:</p>
<blockquote><div>“Whereas, it is the duty of nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God: to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord. And as inasmuch as we know that by his divine law nations, like individuals, are subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world, may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of the civil war which now desolates the land may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people? We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown; <em>but we have forgotten God</em> [italics mine]. We have forgotten the gracious hand, which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to God who made us.It behoves us then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power; to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness. All this being done in sincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the divine teachings, that the united cry of the nation will be heard on high, and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our national sins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country to its former happy condition of unity and peace.”</div></blockquote>
<p>With the “Civil War” changed for “Covid”, is that not a challenge to the secularized world of 2021, once Christian, now “God forgetting”? Is it not us, Christian believers, who need to take the initiative? More to follow!.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="When leaders fail (part 1)">(May 2021) When leaders fail (part 1)</h2><ul><li>Richard Turnbull</li><li>May 2021</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <blockquote><div>[The following article by Revd Dr Richard Turnbull, the new Chairman of the Christian Institute and the Director of the Centre for Enterprise, Markets and Ethics, is in the May 2021 edition of the Evangelical Times and is published with permission of the editor, Mike Judge. I imagine many will not know of this clergyman and his adult abuse, the subject of this article. However, he has in the past preached at Jesmond, and sometime back, given two Bible readings at the Jesmond Conference; and a number of people at JPC, however, have been involved in the Churches in Cambridge and London where he has ministered.

<p><strong>Humility and repentance needed</strong></p>
<p>Jonathan Fletcher is very well known within the Anglican part of conservative evangelicalism, though may be less so among independents. He was the minister of Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon, from 1982-2012, but perhaps the single most influential Anglican conservative evangelical across a much wider spectrum of conferences, camps, and churches. Many flocked to his church, to his mentoring ministry, sought his patronage, with loyalty rewarded for a lifetime. Key appointments, speaking engagements, and organizational roles would all come the way of a loyal servant.</p>
<p>The revelation of the nature of his behaviour requires humility and repentance. The details are distressing, but also shocking. Simply how was he enabled to get away with such ungodly, inappropriate, and exploitative behaviour for so long? We all know that independent churches have also seen their share of unacceptable behaviours. Emmanuel Wimbledon certainly got the tone right in their response to a report on the case under the auspices of Thirtyoneeight. The elders and trustees express their devastation and profound sorrow at the hurt, and offer an unreserved apology. They draw attention to lack of accountability, failure to respond to concerns and arrogance. They add:</p>
<blockquote><div>“We are heartbroken, not only for those who have been victims of Jonathan Fletcher’s abuse, but also by his wholly wrong and inadequate response to the abuse being exposed over the past few years. We long to see credible evidence of his heartfelt repentance in the future.”</div></blockquote>
<p>The report draws attention to two very important matters that cannot be ignored. Firstly, the unacceptable behaviour of a minister of the gospel with destructive consequences for individuals, churches, and the gospel. Secondly, issues of culture affecting leadership, accountability, and expectation within conservative evangelical churches and organizations. These are important and serious matters which all biblically faithful Christians need to take seriously. We would want to advocate and model appropriate biblical behaviours and practices, proper governance, and accountability for the spiritual welfare of all. We often do not help ourselves by failing to adopt good practice. Indeed, those of us who believe in creation mandates for the good of all people and the principles of common grace will want to affirm the central importance of good governance and accountability – spiritual and otherwise.</p>
<p>Yet there remains a worry. We find in this report the right and proper condemnation of abuse, but there is a considerable danger that a valid and appropriate point made is then extended significantly further than is reasonable, with dangerous long-term consequences for the teaching and liberties of the gospel. We need to remain vigilant for biblical teaching. The report often raises a good point but then, through a failure to properly appreciate biblical teaching, the danger then is that a good point becomes a ‘Trojan horse’ for a wider agenda.</p>
<p>I call these points ‘Trojan horses’. The defenders of Troy thought they had defeated the Greek attackers who sailed away leaving their huge wooden horse which they had constructed. The Trojans took it into the city as a trophy. The Greeks, however, had hidden forces within the horse, who once inside the city, emerged and ransacked Troy. So, are there aspects of the report, however well-founded, that pose an existential danger? Yes, I identify here five examples.</p>
<p><strong>Five Examples</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) Proper leadership accountability principles are used against others.</strong></p>
<p>Accountability for leadership is a central issue. Good governance and a healthy Christian culture means proper processes which are implemented for the benefit of all. The failures here are acknowledged by Emmanuel Wimbledon. Rather bizarrely, the report then goes on to demand that the leaders of all conservative evangelical organizations connected to Jonathan Fletcher should stand down - resign. Why? Which ones? Who will decide? There is no justification for seeking to bring down other individuals and groups. <em>In fact, this rather smacks of a negative wider agenda and should be resisted.</em></p>
<p><strong>(2) Appropriate structures are extended to embrace unbiblical teaching.</strong></p>
<p>The report discussed wider structures within Anglicanism in order to enhance the idea of holding the church, Emmanuel Wimbledon, to a wider control. In Anglican terms there are (though not many now) churches which were established as what are known as ‘proprietary chapels’; that is, independent in finance and appointments, but staffed by clergy licensed by a bishop. The whole point was to protect biblical evangelical teaching. To argue, as the report does, that this results in wider accountability and safeguarding failures and should be ended, not only misunderstands the history, but it also fails to appreciate that thousands of non-Anglican independent churches of one type or another are able to establish systems of accountability and safeguarding without losing their independence. <em>This sounds like an attempt to reinforce centralised power and weaken evangelical independence in the Church of England.</em></p>
<p><strong>(3) Reflection on the role of women ignores scriptural provision.</strong></p>
<p>The diversity agenda raises its head in this report. There is a proper place for thinking through the role of women in churches. The report, however, extends this appropriate debate about this role to eldership [‘presbyterate’ or ‘priesthood’] and the need for ‘valuing’ women across all areas of leadership. <em>The report clearly does not understand evangelical biblical teaching about eldership, church leadership and preaching, viewing the issue through one particular lens.</em></p>
<p><strong>(4) Assessment of mistrust proceeds to affirm false teaching.</strong></p>
<p>The report claims that many of the leadership issues were reinforced by establishing a narrative of mistrust towards, for example, other faiths, the diocese, and more liberal teaching. But faithful, biblical, Christian teaching would not wish to affirm the role of liberal teaching which denies the Scriptures. The report misunderstands both the nature of the biblical witness around false teaching and the problematic relationship with the Diocese of Southwark, perhaps the most liberal diocese in the Church of England. Emmanuel Wimbledon are not the only church with a problematic relationship with the Diocese of Southwark. At one point the report calls for mediation. <em>However, mediation is not required; repentance of false teaching is what is needed.</em></p>
<p><strong>(5) Condemnation of bullying and coercion, viewing spiritual abuse as separate category, threatens biblical teaching.</strong></p>
<p>There have been too many examples of bullying and coercion in church contexts, as indeed in many others. This is sinful and ungodly activity, and perpetrators must be properly held to account. However, the report clearly views these issues through the lens of ‘spiritual abuse’. This is positively dangerous. <em>We will find, very quickly, that biblical teaching around marriage, sexuality, atonement, and the uniqueness of Christ are covered by the category of spiritual abuse.</em> We really should welcome what this report has to say about the basic principles of unacceptable behaviour, accountability, governance, and structure. We can never tolerate such activity nor be compliant in enabling such behaviour.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time, we must remain ever vigilant for both Christian teaching itself and, indeed, the freedom to teach the Bible.</p>                    <hr><h2 id="When leaders fail (part 2)">(May 2021) When leaders fail (part 2)</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>May 2021</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Biblical reality of leadership failure</strong></p>
<p>Leadership failure is not something new among the people of God. In Old Testament times out of many examples the most famous were the cases of Aaron and King David.</p>
<p>During the Exodus generation under Moses, Aaron the first High Priest fashioned a Golden Calf – an idolatrous fertility symbol for worship. He also organized a huge feast after which “people rose up to play”, which according to some scholars meant engaging “in what was probably a fertility cult orgy.” Then in the time of the Kings, David, in whose line Jesus was born, after voyeuristically seeing Bathsheba bathing nude, wickedly planned not only adultery with her, but also the murder of her husband!</p>
<p>Then in the New Testament there is Peter (it is after Pentecost and the miraculous healing of a lame-man) being taken to task by Paul, a much younger man. Here is Paul’s account:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“when Cephas </em>[Peter]<em> came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James </em>[head of the church in Jerusalem]<em>, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy”</em> (Galatians 2.11-13).</div></blockquote>
<p>And there are other such leaders in the New Testament. In Thyatira, in Asia Minor, there was being tolerated (in the risen Christ’s words) …</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols”</em> (Revelation 2.20).</div></blockquote>
<p>In every age there are leaders who fail; and we all fail in some ways. Even in times of renewal there are failures in leadership. Let me quote J. C. Ryle from his paper, <em>The Fallibilty of Ministers</em> (which is in our staff hand-book and so is to be read):</p>
<blockquote><div>“The Reformers were honoured instruments in the hand of God for reviving the cause of truth on earth. Yet hardly one of them can be named who did not make some great mistake … The lesson is one that we all need. We are all naturally inclined to lean upon man whom we can see, rather than upon God whom we cannot see. We naturally love to lean upon the ministers of the visible Church, rather than upon the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd and Bishop and High Priest who is invisible. We need to be continually warned<em> [against</em><em>setting church leaders on pedestals]</em> and set upon our guard.”</div></blockquote>
<p>And in recent times there have been high profile problems in the Roman Catholic church over the abuse sexually of boys; and there have been high profile cases of paedophilia in the Church of England. All this is shocking - there is no doubt about it. So when I first heard that there was a case against Jonathan Fletcher in 2019 at the Church Day Out to Hexham, I was shocked. People were telling me about an Article in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> I needed to read, which I duly did when getting home that evening. And there I read that there had been discipline from the diocese of Southwark. I also learnt then or later that there was no police action as the behaviour was with men not boys.</p>
<p>But what should other Christians learn, or take, from this tragedy in Wimbledon?</p>
<p><strong>The past good works of a present wrong doer</strong></p>
<p>One lesson to learn is that all the Christian ministry done prior to, or during, the period of sinful behaviour is not invalid. That is so important for people converted through the ministry of Jonathan Fletcher. That, of course, is the subject of Article 26 of the <em>39 Articles of the Church of England</em>, namely, Of the unworthiness of the minister, which hinders not the effect of the sacrament, which says this:</p>
<blockquote><div>“<em>Although</em> in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just judgement be deposed.”</div></blockquote>
<p>It is obvious: suppose someone reads one of the Bible readings in church and a visitor gets convicted and converted through that passage of Scripture, and later they learn the reader is now in prison, having been arrested and sentenced as being a serial killer. That does not invalidate the Holy Spirit’s working for their regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>An opportunity for reviewing “safeguarding” in churches </strong></p>
<p>However, this particular experience at Wimbledon is a reminder to all of us to check on whether we “advocate and model appropriate biblical behaviours and practices, proper governance, and accountability for the spiritual welfare of all” and particularly governance as it affects safeguarding.</p>
<p>At JPC we have always taken Safeguarding very seriously. We were one of the first churches to be registered with CCPAS (now Thirtyoneeight). And, Jonathan Pryke and I are fully involved in the diocesan safeguarding programme. I have recently completed my required triennial refresher course! We have always had a good relationship with the diocese in safeguarding matters. While we have some problems with the Bishop on some doctrinal issues, we try to follow precisely diocesan practice in practical matters, not least with Safeguarding. Andy Gawn our Safeguarding Officer also is in touch when needed with the diocese. And, of course, all the senior staff would be very happy to talk and offer pastoral support to anyone who might have been disturbed by, or involved in, the Jonathan Fletcher issue.</p>
<p>One problem with Emmanuel Wimbledon was that Jonathan Fletcher did not believe, as I understand it, in a large team of senior staff even though they were a larger church. Instead he had more junior ministry assistants. But Jesmond, with more senior staff, affords a significant amount of informal accountability for the senior staff themselves. If one of us would go “spiritually or morally AWOL”, it would soon be discovered by someone who was worried. And Andy Gawn and Carolyn Hosie are our Safeguarding Officers, so, if anyone has a problem such as they had in Wimbledon, they can talk to them. With only one or two much younger curates at Wimbledon, Jonathan Fletcher was the only senior male leader on the staff that the men involved could talk to and he was the only safeguarding lead by default.</p>
<p>Also, Emmanuel Wimbledon had and still has, I imagine, a level of doctrinal impairment of communion with the diocesan bishop. If so there still needs to be a level of more formal accountability for the clerical senior staff. At JPC we achieve that in normal circumstances by visiting bishops. We have been grateful, over the years, to Howell Davies, Jon Ellison (assistant bishops of Hereford and Winchester, respectively) and, particularly, Bishop Martin Morrison from Johannesburg. So, when Martin has visited annually for Advent, he stays with me (and I am privileged to have extended time with him). But I arrange for him to see all the ordained staff individually. They know they can contact him anytime they need to (and have done so). And there is a meeting for all the senior staff together with him before he goes. I expect that is more time with a senior bishop, who has had huge experience, than most parochial clergy have in the whole Church of England! Of course, this side of heaven we can always make improvements in our safeguarding, structures and accountability. One of my jobs on Sabbatical is to think about such improvements. I would value your prayers.</p>
<p><strong>Post-script</strong></p>
<p>A final question? What are we to make of Jonathan Fletcher, when contacted recently by the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>? For the paper was wanting a comment from him about a sexual incident detailed in the report. He simply replied:</p>
<blockquote><div>“it was 40 years ago and I’m deeply ashamed of that.”</div></blockquote>
<p>And speaking of those he had “spiritually harmed”, he was reported as saying that he was …</p>
<blockquote><div>“… hoping for the day when they’ll recognize my deep penitence and repentance.”</div></blockquote>
<p>Whatever answer we give, let us all heed the final words of Galatians 6.1:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>“Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.”</em></div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="The Queen's Message to the opening session of the 11th General Synod of the Church of England - a co">(January 2022) The Queen's Message to the opening session of the 11th General Synod of the Church of England - a co</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>January 2022</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Queen’s message</strong></p>
<blockquote><div>“Your Graces, the Convocations of Canterbury and York, duly called together in obedience to Our Royal Writs, are on this day joined together in accordance with the Synodical Government Measure 1969 and the House of Laity is added to them in accordance with the Measure, so as to constitute the Eleventh General Synod of the Church of England. Archbishops and members, the opening of a new Synod provides an opportunity for us all to give thanks for the witness of those who have gone before, and pray for wisdom as you seek to balance change and continuity in the decisions that lie ahead.It is hard to believe that it is over 50 years since Prince Philip and I attended the very first meeting of the General Synod. None of us can slow the passage of time; and while we often focus on all that has changed in the intervening years, much remains unchanged, including the Gospel of Christ and his teachings. The list of tasks facing that first General Synod may sound familiar to many of you: Christian education; Christian unity; the better distribution of the ordained ministry to the needs of the population. But one stands out supreme: “to bring the people of this country to the knowledge and the love of God.Of course, in our richly diverse modern society, the well-being of the nation depends on the contribution of people of all faiths, and of none.But for people of faith, the last few years have been particularly hard, with unprecedented restrictions in accessing the comfort and reassurance of public worship. For many, it has been a time of anxiety, of grief, and of weariness. Yet the Gospel has brought hope, as it has done throughout the ages; and the Church has adapted and continued its ministry, often in new ways - such as digital forms of worship.St. Paul reminds us that all Christians are entrusted with the ministry of reconciliation, and the deepening of relations across the great Christian traditions has been a continuing priority since the first General Synod in 1970. And so I am pleased to note the enhanced cooperation between the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, as well as the sustained ecumenical links between many churches, in the pursuit of Christian unity.Your Graces and members of the Synod, the next five years will not always be straightforward. Like every new Synod, you have inherited weighty responsibilities with many issues to address, reports to debate, and difficult decisions to make. You may have to consider proposals on governance, on conduct, on the use of resources, and on other issues; and on a vision for the future of the Church.In some areas, there will, of course, be differing views and my hope is that you will be strengthened with the certainty of the love of God, as you work together and draw on the Church’s tradition of unity in fellowship for the tasks ahead.At the beginning of this new Synod, my prayer is that the Lord’s blessing may be upon you as you embark on your deliberations; and that you will find inspiration in the joyous words of the hymn you sang this morning:‘O Comforter, draw near,within my heart appear,and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.’”ELIZABETH R.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The future of the Queen</strong></p>
<p>The above was actually delivered by His Royal Highness the Earl of Wessex. For the Queen is 'easing up' through age and health reasons. But she is not yet retiring or abdicating. And we must thank God for that. For we understand her faith is a real trust in Jesus as her Lord. So when she underlined the hymn sung at the opening of the new Synod, I am sure she meant her underlining to be taken seriously as a prayer for the Holy Spirit to be working. And how members of the Synod need to pray (and Christians outside the Synod need pray) that, over the next five years (God willing) John 16.8:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>…the Holy Spirit will convict the world </em>[i.e. all – including Christians inside and outside the Synod]<em> concerning sin and righteousness and judgment</em></div></blockquote>
<p>I, too, am sure the Queen has taken her Coronation Oath of 1953 seriously. This Oath includes the Archbishop saying: "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel?” And it ends with the Queen laying her hand on the Bible and saying these words: “The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God.” And immediately following the Oath she is presented with the Holy Bible by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, with the Archbishop (of Canterbury) saying:</p>
<blockquote><div>Our gracious Queen: to keep your Majesty ever mindful of the Law and the Gospel of God as the Rule for the whole life and government of Christian Princes, we present you with this Book, the most valuable thing that this world affords.</div></blockquote>
<p>And the Moderator continues:</p>
<blockquote><div>Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God.</div></blockquote>
<p>So thank God that the Queen is not retiring or abdicating. The Queen may be worried about her successor. For those promises may mean little to many of her subjects and to some members of the Royal Family, but they mean a lot to her. Her influence, therefore, is for good and accordingly she is hugely respected. We do not have a Republican system of Democracy, but a constitutional Monarchy and, morally, the Monarch still has, in the UK, great importance. And we should pray for her as she thinks (and is advised) about her future. In the mean-time we, at JPC, are beginning to plan how we can Celebrate her Platinum Year.</p>
<p><strong>Rethinking</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, there is a debate going in Christian circles regarding how all of us, young or old, should think about old age and retirement. For most of us, not self-employed, unlike the Queen have to retire. There certainly is a debate in America. I was challenged some years ago by Albert Mohler, a Principal (or President) of a large US Evangelical theological college when writing under the heading, The <em>Scandal of Retirement</em>:</p>
<blockquote><div>In the years after World War 2, Americans developed the idea that the good life meant having a fulfilling career followed by a lengthy retirement. The ideal of retirement seems to be a life of leisure and ease, occasionally interrupted by travel and entertainment. That is a fundamentally dangerous concept.In the first place, it is unprecedented in human history. The idea of a long period of unproductive leisure at the end of life is a modern invention, and it flies in the face of the Bible’s exhortation to meaningful work and service in the kingdom. This retirement ideal is also financially irresponsible, since improved health and the extension of life (good things in themselves) have lengthened the typical span of life after retirement by many years. This is not economically viable for a large population over the long term. This does not mean that we expect workers to stay in the same job until they drop of exhaustion, or that leaders must stay in positions of leadership until death. It does mean that the American ideal of retirement does not meet the Christian standard of faithfulness.For Christians the issue should be redeployment rather than retirement…I can envision a day when I am no longer President, when I do not have to sit in long meetings and bear the burdens of daily leadership. I can look forward, at some future point, to a time when…I can finally get to some of the writing and teaching projects that are important to me…and to investing more directly in certain lives and places where I might make a decisive difference. But all that is not retirement. It is redeployment</div></blockquote>
<p>And another famous US Christian leader, John Piper, now retired, but writing when still in office as pastor of a large church:</p>
<blockquote><div>Finishing life to the glory of Christ means resolutely resisting the typical American dream of retirement. It means being so satisfied with all that God promises to be for us in Christ that we are set free from the cravings that create so much emptiness and uselessness in retirement. Instead, knowing that we have an infinitely satisfying and everlasting inheritance in God just over the horizon of life makes us zealous in our few remaining years here to spend ourselves in the sacrifices of love, not the accumulation of comforts.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The next chapter</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I am one of the few clergy in the Church of England that does not have to retire. However, I believe, I personally am approaching the next 'chapter' (another word for 'redeployment') in my life, when I will have been at JPC for 50 years. Like Al Mohler I believe I need to spend most of my energy in teaching through writing. Such is the need in the light of the confusion, as I see it, in the wider church (witness the new Synod’s agenda) and country; and, therefore, JPC is in danger also. But I have problem. I personally have always found the Epistle to the Hebrews so helpful. And I have always taken seriously, and been reminded recently, of Hebrews 13.17. For in “8 Great things about being a Church member” in Tony Merida’s <em>Love your</em> <em>Church</em> (we are studying in our Home Groups) he quotes that verse on page 116 when the writer is talking about obeying leaders and submitting to them. And the reason is:</p>
<blockquote><div><em>for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>So I cannot just leave when I want. For I have to give an account, one day to almighty God, for the souls of the church family at JPC. So before beginning the next chapter, I have to make sure the church will be in secure hands spiritually and theologically under the new senior leadership. For a range of reasons I am confident that is possible and will happen at God’s right time. However, an essential will be in 2022 to be focusing on our vision of <em>Godly Living, Church Growth, and Changing Britain</em>, and 'maintaining and promulgating sound Scriptural and Evangelical Truth'. And God is, indeed, working in our midst. So how we should trust him. For we can thank God for answering our prayers and for the generosity of members at JPC for the result of the appeal. At lunch time on Friday 7 January it was exactly £105,000 – the target!</p>
<p>So how, in our confused world, we should encourage ourselves by the verse for the year (Hebrews 13.5-6):</p>
<blockquote><div><em>God has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’ So we can confidently say, ‘The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?’</em></div></blockquote>                    <hr><h2 id="UK Government’s Conversion Therapy Consultation">(February 2022) UK Government’s Conversion Therapy Consultation</h2><ul><li>David Holloway</li><li>February 2022</li><li>Society and Public Life</li></ul>
                                                <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>The government will introduce a legislative ban on the practice of so-called conversion therapy. This consultation seeks views on proposals on how we plan to ban these practices, which particularly affect LGBT people. This consultation closes on Friday 4 February 2022 at 11:45pm.<br>The consultation seeks views on a package of proposed measures that will apply to England and Wales. These include:</p>
<p>• a ban on conversion therapy – introducing a new criminal offence alongside sentence uplifts for existing offences</p>
<p>• a package of support for victims, restricting promotion of conversion therapies, removing profit streams, and strengthening the case for disqualification from holding a senior role in a charity</p>
<p>• introducing Conversion Therapy Protection Orders to protect potential victims from undergoing the practice including overseas</p>
<p>• exploring further measures to prevent the promotion and advertisement of conversion therapy</p>
<p>Once the consultation has closed, the responses will inform the final phase of work on the policy proposals. The Equality Hub will prepare draft legislation by spring 2022, which will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
<p><strong>An important letter</strong></p>
<p>I and 2545 other clergy and church pastoral workers have sent to Liz Truss, MP, the following letter. Our worries will be clear as you read on:</p>
<blockquote><div>Dear Secretary of StateWe are Christian ministers and pastoral workers from a broad range of churches, who have in common that we hold to orthodox, historic Christian teaching on sexual ethics. We are writing in response to the consultation on “Banning ‘Conversion Therapy’” presented by you to Parliament on 29th October 2021.In our churches we welcome and show love to many people who have different experience and views, including same-sex attraction and forms of gender transition. We always seek to act in love, with gentleness and respect, for the good of all, and never with any form of coercion or control.We are grateful to the government for having made clear in the consultation that it does not intend this legislation to impact the normal practice of religion. Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned that the legislative approach outlined would do exactly this. We see in these proposals a clear possibility that our duty as ministers, of proclaiming the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and calling people to find life in him, which includes living by his laws, will be criminalised. We also believe it could be used against Christian parents who could equally be criminalised for loving advice and teaching given to their own children.The category of ‘Conversion Therapy’ is one which is so broad as to be essentially meaningless. It has the effect of implying an equivalence between calling people to conversion to Christ, which is our duty as Christian ministers, and evil and disreputable past practices which are already illegal and which Christians are the first to condemn. Legislating against such a bizarrely broad category is clearly not viable and strongly risks criminalising us as we fulfil our compassionate duties as Christian ministers and pastors. This would be a clear breach of our legal right to manifest our religion.Christianity has always held that God created humanity with the lifelong marriage of one man and one woman as a gracious gift to humanity and a central part of his design for human society. To violate that pattern, by sexual activity outside marriage or denial of our created sex, is sin. As such it is not only morally wrong but carries with it deep and tragic consequences for individuals, families and society. It is a central part of our calling to bring Christ’s compassion to a broken world, that we call people to live according to God’s gift and pattern of marriage and offer them pastoral support to help them do so. This has nothing to do with therapy; it has everything to do with what it means to be a Christian.To urge and assist people to live in this way, far from being harmful, is a kind and merciful act, and of benefit to all. What is plainly and terribly harmful is when anyone, especially the young, believes that their identity is found purely in their feelings and that happiness is to be found in misusing and harming their healthy bodies. Yet the proposals would apparently criminalise us for seeking to care for people and seeking to dissuade them from this kind of harm.Furthermore, it is our duty to call people to be converted to Christ; that is, to turn from believing that we are identified and best guided by self, to knowing that we are identified and best guided by God. Christian Conversion inevitably means giving up on lifestyles incompatible with being a Christian, of which sexual sins are just one. It should not be a criminal offence for us as Christian ministers to persuade, to teach and to help people of every age to become, and to live as, orthodox Christians. It should not be a criminal offence for us to instruct our children that God made them male and female, in his image, and has reserved sex for the marriage of one man and one woman. Yet this seems to be the likely outcome of the proposed legislation.We therefore very much hope (and pray) that these proposals will be dropped in their current form. We have no desire to become criminals, and place a high value on submitting to and supporting our government. Yet we think it important you are aware that if it were to come about that the loving, compassionate exercise of orthodox Christian ministry, including the teaching of the Christian understanding of sex and marriage, is effectively made a criminal offence, we would with deep sadness continue to do our duty to God in this matter.Nevertheless, we are confident that this outcome is not what your department intends by these proposals, and for that we are most grateful. However, this will require the adoption of an entirely different approach.We write to you as faithful subjects of Her Majesty the Queen, Defender of the Faith, in the hope that this will assist her Majesty’s government to avoid unwittingly legislating against the very faith of which she has been appointed defender. We add this to the prayers that we constantly make for the government’s essential and God-given task of ruling our nation.Yours faithfullyDavid Holloway and 2545 other Christian Ministers and Pastoral Workers (including, of course, others from JPC).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Good News</strong></p>
<p>The Government’s consultation has been extended until 11.45 pm on 4 February (2022) and <strong>any Christian can now sign</strong> in support of the <a href="https://ministersconsultationresponse.com" title="“clergy letter” ">“clergy letter”&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The Government has said that it does not intend to outlaw “everyday religious practice” but it still risks bringing in one of the most religiously repressive laws the country has ever seen. However, The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has just told the Government that its conversion therapy proposals risk “unintended consequences” and must not cut across basic religious freedoms. It is true that “coercive and abusive behaviour should be caught by existing law. But it is wrong for biblically faithful preaching, prayer, pastoral care and parenting to be in the sights of lawmakers” (<em>The Christian Institute</em>).</p>                    <hr>
