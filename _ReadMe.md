So the plan is to create a basic editor and site the that creates the smallest most website efficenct sites possible. 

This means that Jekyll build/compile time will suffer but should always aim to be as small as possible. 
Otherwise the it would not be cost effective design process. 

To do:
- get a basic cmd working
- cmd to create a post
- cmd to check posts (like the one that was started to be created in python)
- get build published to site via cmds
